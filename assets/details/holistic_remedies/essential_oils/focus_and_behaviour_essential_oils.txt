#Focus & Behaviour#

###About Essential Oils###
Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts obtained from leaves, flowers, bark, roots, seeds, or resin. They contain the plant’s natural aromatic compounds, which influence the nervous system, emotions, and overall energetic balance.

Through their aromatic and energetic qualities, essential oils can support mental clarity, focus, learning, and balanced behaviour. They are often used to support awareness, alertness, and calm responsiveness.

Essential oils may be used aromatically, energetically, or topically when appropriate and properly diluted. Animals often respond very sensitively to essential oils, which is why energetic testing methods such as kinesiology are especially helpful when working with them.

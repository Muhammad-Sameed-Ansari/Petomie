###About Essential Oils###
Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts obtained from leaves, flowers, bark, roots, seeds, or resin. They contain the plant’s natural aromatic compounds, which influence the nervous system, emotions, and overall energetic balance.

Because scent is processed through the limbic system of the brain, essential oils can gently affect emotional memory, stress responses, and stored patterns. This makes them powerful tools for supporting emotional processing and energetic release.

Essential oils may be used aromatically, energetically, or topically when appropriate and properly diluted. Animals often respond very sensitively to essential oils, which is why energetic testing methods such as kinesiology are especially helpful when working with them.

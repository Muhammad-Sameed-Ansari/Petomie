###About Essential Oils###
Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts obtained from leaves, flowers, bark, roots, seeds, or resin. They contain the plant’s natural aromatic compounds, which influence the nervous system, emotions, and overall energetic balance.

Through their aromatic and energetic properties, essential oils can support physical balance, recovery processes, and overall vitality. They are commonly used to support the body during times of strain, imbalance, or healing.

Essential oils may be used aromatically, energetically, or topically when appropriate and properly diluted. Animals often respond very sensitively to essential oils, which is why energetic testing methods such as kinesiology are especially helpful when working with them.

#Cherry Plum#

Bach Flower Remedies are a system of natural essences created by Dr. Edward Bach in the 1930s to support emotional balance and mental harmony.

###Description###
Cherry Plum (Prunus cerasifera) addresses the fear of losing control — emotionally, mentally, or behaviorally.  
It is used when inner tension builds to the point where an individual feels they may “explode,” break down, or act irrationally.  
Cherry Plum restores emotional stability and a sense of safe inner containment.

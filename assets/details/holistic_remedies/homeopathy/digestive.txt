###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In digestive imbalances, they can support regulation of the gut, assimilation, and elimination when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe carefully before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

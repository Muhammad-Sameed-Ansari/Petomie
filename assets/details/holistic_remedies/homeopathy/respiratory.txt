###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In respiratory imbalances, they can support breathing, lung function, and mucous regulation when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe carefully before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

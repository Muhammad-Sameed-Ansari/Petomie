###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In inflammatory processes, they can support regulation of heat, swelling, pain, and tissue response when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe carefully before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In immune-related imbalances, they can support the body’s self-regulation, resilience, and response to stressors when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe carefully before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In chronic conditions, they aim to support long-standing patterns, constitutional tendencies, and deep imbalances rather than isolated symptoms. Correct remedy selection, potency, and timing are essential.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and allow sufficient time for observation before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

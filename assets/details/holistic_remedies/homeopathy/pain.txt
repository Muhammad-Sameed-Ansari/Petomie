###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In cases of pain, inflammation, or discomfort, they can support the body’s natural self-regulation when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe carefully before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

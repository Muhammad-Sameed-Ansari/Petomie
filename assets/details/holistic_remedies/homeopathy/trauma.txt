###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In cases of trauma, shock, or injury, they can support the body’s natural healing response when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

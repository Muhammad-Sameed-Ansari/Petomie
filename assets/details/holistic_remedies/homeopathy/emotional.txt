###About Homeopathics###
Homeopathic remedies work on an energetic and informational level. In emotional and behavioural imbalances, they can support regulation of the nervous system and emotional processing when the correct remedy, potency, and timing are chosen.

For animals, it is especially important to test remedies individually, use one remedy at a time, and observe carefully before repeating. Homeopathics may be given physically or used energetically, depending on what tests best.

#Ureters#

###Location###
Each ureter extends from the kidney’s renal pelvis to the urinary bladder, running along the dorsal abdominal wall.

###Shape###
Long, narrow, flexible muscular tubes lined with smooth epithelium and surrounded by layers of muscle fibers that enable rhythmic movement.

###Parts###
- **Upper Section:** Originates from the renal pelvis.
- **Middle Section:** Runs along the dorsal body wall, entering the pelvic cavity.
- **Lower Section:** Penetrates the bladder wall at an oblique angle to prevent backflow of urine.

###Function###
- Transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder using rhythmic contractions (peristalsis).
- Act as a one-way passage preventing reflux of urine.
- Adjust urine flow rate in coordination with kidney output.

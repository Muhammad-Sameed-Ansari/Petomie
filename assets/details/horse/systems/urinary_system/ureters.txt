#Ureters#

The ureters are narrow muscular tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.  
They move fluid through rhythmic contractions called peristalsis.  
Energetically, they represent **flow, movement, and direction**, guiding the release of what is no longer needed.

###Parts###

##Upper Section##  
Connects to the renal pelvis at the kidney.  
Energetically, it symbolizes transition from cleansing to release.

##Middle Section##  
Passes along the abdominal cavity toward the bladder.  
Energetically, it reflects steady movement and alignment.

##Lower Section##  
Enters the urinary bladder at an angle to prevent backflow.  
Energetically, it represents protection and precision in letting go.

###Function###  
The ureters transport urine safely from the kidneys to the bladder.  
Energetically, they maintain **flow and progression**, ensuring smooth transitions and emotional release.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blockage: stones or energetic stagnation.  
Infection: irritation or emotional tension.  
Pain: tightness or poor flow.  
Energetic blockage: fear of release or resistance to change.

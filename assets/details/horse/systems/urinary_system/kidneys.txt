#Kidneys#

###Location###
The kidneys are located in the upper part of the abdominal cavity, against the dorsal body wall on either side of the spine.
The right kidney lies further forward beneath the last two or three ribs and is shaped like a heart.
The left kidney sits slightly farther back and is bean-shaped, positioned near the last rib and first lumbar vertebrae.

###Shape###
The kidneys are firm, smooth, reddish-brown organs surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule.
Their shape and surface are adapted for efficient filtration and blood flow.

###Parts###
- **Cortex:** The outer layer containing millions of nephrons where blood filtration begins.
- **Medulla:** The inner zone that concentrates and channels urine.
- **Renal Pelvis:** A funnel-shaped cavity collecting urine before it enters the ureter.
- **Hilus:** The recessed area where blood vessels, lymph vessels, and the ureter enter and leave the kidney.

###Function###
- Filter waste, urea, and toxins from the bloodstream.
- Maintain water, electrolyte, and pH balance.
- Regulate blood pressure through fluid control and hormone secretion.
- Produce erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell formation.
- Excrete metabolic waste and maintain homeostasis essential for performance and health.

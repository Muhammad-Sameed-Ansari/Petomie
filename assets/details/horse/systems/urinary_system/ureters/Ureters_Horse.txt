#Ureters#

##Location##
Extend from the renal pelvis of each kidney to the urinary bladder, running along the dorsal abdominal wall. In the horse, they pass caudally within the retroperitoneal space and enter the bladder at an oblique angle through the dorsal wall.

##Shape##
Narrow, muscular tubes approximately 6–8 mm in diameter and 60–70 cm long:
- **Proximal Segment:** Originates from the renal pelvis, conveying urine via peristaltic action.
- **Middle Segment:** Courses caudally along the abdominal wall within the mesoureter.
- **Distal Segment:** Passes through the pelvic cavity before entering the bladder.
- **Wall Structure:** Composed of mucosa, smooth muscle layers, and an outer adventitia for support.
- **Ureterovesical Junction:** Oblique entry into the bladder that prevents urine backflow during filling.

##Function##
Transports urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder through rhythmic peristaltic contractions
Prevents reflux of urine into the kidneys via the one-way entry mechanism
Maintains continuous flow of urine regardless of body position or motion
Acts as part of the urinary drainage system preserving sterile urine passage
Coordinates with renal output and bladder filling to regulate excretion

#Urinary Bladder#

###Location###
Lies in the pelvic cavity just behind the pubic bone, between the rectum and the abdominal wall.
When full, the bladder expands into the abdominal cavity; when empty, it lies entirely within the pelvis.

###Shape###
A hollow, muscular, pear-shaped sac lined with transitional epithelium that allows for expansion and contraction.
Its smooth inner walls prevent friction and facilitate efficient storage.

###Parts###
- **Apex:** Rounded cranial tip of the bladder.
- **Body:** Central expandable portion where urine is stored.
- **Neck:** Narrow region leading into the urethra.
- **Trigone:** A triangular region formed by the openings of the two ureters and the start of the urethra.
- **Sphincters:** Circular muscles that control urine flow.

###Function###
- Temporarily stores urine until excretion.
- Expands to accommodate increasing urine volume without a rise in internal pressure.
- Contracts during urination through smooth muscle action.
- Maintains controlled release through internal (involuntary) and external (voluntary) sphincters.
- Plays a role in electrolyte and fluid balance through sensory feedback to the kidneys.

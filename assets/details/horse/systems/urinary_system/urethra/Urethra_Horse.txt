#Urethra#

##Location##
Extends from the neck of the urinary bladder to the external urethral orifice. In the horse, the urethra runs through the pelvic cavity and perineal region. Its length and course differ between sexes — short and wide in mares, long and narrow in stallions, where it passes through the penis.

##Shape##
A tubular structure composed of smooth and skeletal muscle layers with mucosal lining:
- **Pelvic Urethra:** Begins at the bladder neck and passes through the pelvic cavity; surrounded by the urethralis muscle.
- **Penile (Spongy) Urethra:** In stallions, continues through the penis within the corpus spongiosum and ends at the glans.
- **External Urethral Orifice:** Opening for urine excretion; located on the ventral aspect of the vestibule in mares or at the tip of the glans in males.
- **Mucosa:** Lined with transitional epithelium near the bladder, becoming stratified distally.

##Function##
Conducts urine from the urinary bladder to the exterior during urination
Serves as a passageway for semen during ejaculation in stallions
Prevents backflow of urine through coordinated sphincter control
Maintains urinary continence via smooth and skeletal muscle regulation
Acts as the terminal conduit of the urinary system supporting excretion and reproduction

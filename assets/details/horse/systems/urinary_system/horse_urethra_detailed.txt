#Urethra#

###Location###
Extends from the bladder neck to the external urinary opening.
In mares, the urethra is short and wide, opening at the floor of the vestibule just inside the vulva.
In stallions, it is long and narrow, running through the penis and joining the reproductive ducts.

###Shape###
A smooth, tubular structure with an elastic mucosal lining surrounded by muscle layers.
The urethra is divided into pelvic and external sections for functional efficiency.

###Parts###
- **Internal Sphincter:** Located at the bladder neck; controls urine release involuntarily.
- **External Sphincter:** At the end of the urethra; provides voluntary control.
- **Pelvic Section:** Runs through the pelvis, shared by both sexes.
- **Penile Section (male):** Extends through the penis, also serving reproductive function.
- **Vestibular Section (female):** Opens into the vulva, forming the final outlet for urine.

###Function###
- Transports urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
- Controls urination through both voluntary and involuntary muscle actions.
- In stallions, also carries semen during ejaculation.
- Maintains sterility by flushing bacteria and debris from the urinary tract.
- Assists in regulating internal pressure during urination.

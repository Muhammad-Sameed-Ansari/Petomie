#Sympathetic & Parasympathetic Divisions#

##Location##
Both divisions form parts of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), regulating involuntary body functions.
- **Sympathetic Division:** Originates from the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord (T1–L4). Nerve fibers travel through the sympathetic chain (paravertebral ganglia) and prevertebral ganglia near major abdominal vessels.
- **Parasympathetic Division:** Arises from the craniosacral regions — the brainstem (cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X) and the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4). Ganglia lie close to or within target organs, ensuring local control.

##Shape##
- **Sympathetic System:**
  Consists of short preganglionic and long postganglionic fibers, forming paired sympathetic trunks along the vertebral column. Includes specialized ganglia such as the cervicothoracic (stellate) and celiac ganglia.
- **Parasympathetic System:**
  Made of long preganglionic and short postganglionic fibers, creating diffuse networks near target organs. The vagus nerve (CN X) carries most fibers to thoracic and abdominal organs.
Both divisions work together through a dual innervation system, balancing activity between stimulation and relaxation.

##Function##
### **Sympathetic Division – “Fight or Flight”**
Prepares the horse for physical activity and stress response.
- Increases heart rate and blood pressure.
- Dilates bronchi for greater airflow.
- Redirects blood to muscles and away from the digestive tract.
- Stimulates energy release (glucose and fatty acids).
- Dilates pupils and raises alertness.
- Reduces digestive and urinary activity.

### **Parasympathetic Division – “Rest and Digest”**
Restores and conserves energy during calm states.
- Slows heart rate and lowers blood pressure.
- Stimulates digestion and nutrient absorption.
- Promotes glandular secretion and intestinal movement.
- Facilitates urination and defecation.
- Supports reproduction and tissue repair.

Together, these two divisions maintain homeostasis, allowing the horse to shift efficiently between alertness and relaxation.

#Sympathetic Division#

##Location##
Originates from the **thoracolumbar region** of the spinal cord, specifically from **T1 to L4** in the horse.  
Preganglionic fibers exit the spinal cord through ventral roots and travel to the **sympathetic trunk (chain)**, which runs along both sides of the vertebral column from the neck to the pelvis.  
Ganglia are positioned in the **paravertebral chain** (along the spinal column) and **prevertebral ganglia** near major abdominal vessels such as the celiac and mesenteric arteries.

##Shape##
Composed of **short preganglionic fibers** and **long postganglionic fibers**, forming paired chains of ganglia linked by interconnecting nerve fibers.  
These fibers extend to all major organ systems, blood vessels, and smooth muscle structures.  

- **Paravertebral (Sympathetic Chain) Ganglia:** Lie alongside the vertebral column and connect to spinal nerves at each level.  
- **Prevertebral Ganglia:** Located near the abdominal aorta (celiac, cranial, and caudal mesenteric ganglia); distribute fibers to abdominal and pelvic organs.  
- **Cervicothoracic (Stellate) Ganglion:** Large fusion of cervical and thoracic ganglia that sends fibers to the heart and lungs.  
- **Splanchnic Nerves:** Carry preganglionic fibers to the abdominal ganglia and viscera.  
- **Adrenal Medulla (Modified Ganglion):** Acts as an endocrine extension of the sympathetic system, releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline into circulation.

##Function##
Controls the body’s **“fight or flight”** response, preparing the horse for action and heightened alertness.  
- **Increases heart rate and cardiac output** to deliver more oxygen to muscles.  
- **Dilates bronchi** for enhanced airflow to the lungs.  
- **Redirects blood flow** away from digestive organs toward skeletal muscles.  
- **Stimulates glycogen breakdown** for immediate energy release.  
- **Dilates pupils** to improve vision in low light.  
- **Inhibits digestion and urination** during stress or exertion.  
- **Contracts piloerector muscles and activates sweat glands** for thermoregulation.  
Acts in balance with the **parasympathetic and enteric divisions** to maintain homeostasis during and after stress or exertion.

#Enteric Division#

##Location##
Located throughout the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, extending from the esophagus to the rectum.
Found within two main nerve plexuses: the **myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus** between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers, and the **submucosal (Meissner’s) plexus** within the submucosa.
Both plexuses are embedded in the gut wall and function independently, though they communicate with the central and autonomic nervous systems.

##Shape##
Composed of dense networks of interconnected neurons and glial cells forming an intrinsic “gut brain.”
These neurons are organized into ganglia and interconnected by nerve fibers that run along the intestinal wall in layered plexiform patterns.

- **Myenteric (Auerbach’s) Plexus:** Located between muscle layers; regulates peristalsis and muscular tone of the gut wall.
- **Submucosal (Meissner’s) Plexus:** Lies within the submucosa; controls secretion, blood flow, and absorption in the intestinal lining.
- **Sensory Neurons:** Detect mechanical stretch, pressure, and chemical changes in ingesta.
- **Motor Neurons:** Stimulate smooth muscle contraction, glandular activity, and local reflexes.
- **Interneurons:** Integrate sensory and motor input, enabling independent reflex control without brain involvement.

##Function##
Acts as the intrinsic control system of the gastrointestinal tract, coordinating digestive processes without requiring direct input from the brain or spinal cord.
- **Regulates peristaltic movement** and rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle.
- **Controls digestive secretion** and absorption of nutrients.
- **Maintains intestinal blood flow** to match metabolic activity.
- **Integrates with parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions** to adjust digestive activity according to the body’s state.
Ensures efficient digestion, nutrient absorption, and internal stability within the gastrointestinal system.

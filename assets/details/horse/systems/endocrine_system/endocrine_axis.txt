#Endocrine Axis#

The horse’s endocrine axis is the communication network linking the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and peripheral endocrine organs.  
It ensures hormonal balance and coordination throughout the body.  
Energetically, it represents unity, communication, and alignment between body, mind, and spirit.

###Parts###

##Hypothalamus##  
Senses internal changes and sends signals to the pituitary gland.  
Energetically, it represents awareness and control.

##Pituitary Gland##  
The master gland that regulates other endocrine glands.  
Energetically, it symbolizes leadership and harmony.

##Peripheral Glands##  
Include thyroid, adrenals, gonads, and pancreas.  
Energetically, they reflect specialized focus and balanced cooperation.

###Function###  
The endocrine axis maintains hormonal communication and equilibrium.  
It adjusts metabolism, growth, and reproduction based on internal and external cues.  
Energetically, it sustains flow and synchronicity throughout the horse’s being.

###Common Imbalances###  
Hormonal Fluctuations: disrupted signaling.  
Fatigue or Mood Shifts: imbalance in central control.  
Metabolic Irregularities: disconnection between organs.  
Energetically, imbalance may show as loss of inner harmony or disharmony between purpose and action.

#Hypothalamus#

The horse’s hypothalamus is a small but vital brain region controlling hormone release and body balance.  
It links the nervous and endocrine systems.  
Energetically, it represents awareness, regulation, and harmony.

###Parts###

##Neurosecretory Cells##  
Produce releasing hormones that act on the pituitary.  
Energetically, they symbolize communication and coordination.

##Nuclei##  
Clusters of nerve cells sensing changes in temperature, hunger, and stress.  
Energetically, they represent sensitivity and adaptability.

###Function###  
The hypothalamus maintains homeostasis by regulating hunger, thirst, temperature, and emotional response.  
It directs the pituitary gland to balance hormones.  
Energetically, it acts as the control center aligning mind and body rhythms.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stress Response Issues: overactivity or exhaustion.  
Appetite or Temperature Shifts: imbalance in regulation.  
Fatigue or Mood Swings: disrupted signaling.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from emotional overload or disconnection from inner awareness.

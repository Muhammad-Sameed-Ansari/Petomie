#Olfactory Nerve (I)#

The horse’s olfactory nerve governs the sense of smell, allowing recognition of food, herd members, and environmental cues.  
It connects the horse deeply to its surroundings and instincts, reflecting awareness, trust, and connection to subtle signals in nature.  
Energetically, it represents intuition, instinct, and sensory communication with the environment.

###Location###
Located within the nasal cavity, arising from the olfactory epithelium and passing through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulbs of the brain.

###Parts###
Olfactory epithelium – sensory receptors in the nasal mucosa.  
Olfactory bulbs – receive and process scent signals.  
Olfactory tracts – transmit signals to the brain’s perception centers.

###Function###
Detects and transmits scents to the brain, influencing feeding, safety awareness, and communication.  
Energetically, it connects instinct and higher awareness, allowing the horse to sense emotion, safety, and energetic presence.

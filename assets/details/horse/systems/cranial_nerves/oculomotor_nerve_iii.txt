#Oculomotor Nerve (III)#

The horse’s oculomotor nerve governs most of the eye’s movement, controlling light response and coordination.  
It ensures alignment and visual focus, maintaining balance between awareness and rest.  
Energetically, it reflects direction, focus, and precision.

###Location###
Originates in the midbrain and extends forward to the eye socket, supplying most of the extraocular muscles and the pupil’s sphincter muscle.

###Parts###
Superior branch – controls upper eyelid and eye elevation.  
Inferior branch – moves eye inward, downward, and controls pupil constriction.  
Ciliary fibers – adjust lens for focus.

###Function###
Regulates eye motion, focus, and pupil reaction to light.  
Energetically, it supports focus, attention, and the ability to direct energy toward what truly matters.

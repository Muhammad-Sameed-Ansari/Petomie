#Optic Nerve (II)#

The horse’s optic nerve carries the gift of sight, connecting eye to brain and translating light into perception.  
It supports awareness, coordination, and trust in the environment.  
Energetically, it represents vision, clarity, and perception of truth.

###Location###
Originates from the retina at the back of the eye and extends through the optic canal to the brain, where both nerves form the optic chiasm.

###Parts###
Retinal fibers – collect light information.  
Optic nerve trunk – transmits visual signals.  
Optic chiasm – crossing fibers for depth and field vision.  
Optic tracts – carry processed signals to the brain’s visual cortex.

###Function###
Enables visual interpretation, depth perception, and environmental navigation.  
Energetically, it connects to inner and outer clarity, perception, and awareness of one’s path.

#Median Nerve#

The median nerve is one of the main nerves of the forelimb, running through the middle of the arm and forearm.  
It powers flexor muscles and provides sensation to parts of the lower leg and hoof region.  
Energetically, it represents **coordination, flexibility, and balanced effort**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from both the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus.  
Energetically, it connects dual aspects of power and precision.

##Pathway##  
Travels down the inner forelimb, crossing near the elbow and extending to the fetlock.  
Energetically, it symbolizes the path of graceful control and directed strength.

##Branches##  
Supplies digital flexors and skin along the medial aspect of the forelimb.  
Energetically, these reflect flow and adaptability in expression.

###Function###  
The median nerve enables controlled flexion and refined motion in the forelimb.  
Energetically, it sustains fluid coordination and balanced interaction between action and stillness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Flexion weakness: nerve strain or muscular tension.  
Sensory loss in lower limb: compression or poor circulation.  
Pain along inner leg: inflammation or energetic congestion.  
Energetic blockage: difficulty adapting or letting go.  
Energetic weakness: imbalance between effort and rest.

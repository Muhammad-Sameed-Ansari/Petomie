#Ulnar Nerve#

The ulnar nerve is a branch of the brachial plexus that supplies parts of the flexor muscles and skin of the lower limb.  
It runs along the caudal side of the forelimb and contributes to flexion of the carpus and digits.  
Energetically, it represents **sensitivity, fine control, and emotional expression through touch**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Emerges from the medial cord of the brachial plexus.  
Energetically, it connects inner strength with delicate awareness.

##Pathway##  
Travels down the caudal forelimb beside the ulnar artery toward the fetlock.  
Energetically, it reflects inward flow and emotional perception.

##Branches##  
Innervates flexor carpi ulnaris, deep digital flexor, and skin on the caudal limb.  
Energetically, these reflect refined control and emotional communication.

###Function###  
The ulnar nerve enables bending and fine motion of the lower limb.  
Energetically, it maintains sensitivity and emotional harmony in action.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak flexion: compression or overstretching.  
Numbness in lower limb: restricted circulation or energy flow.  
Pain along elbow or fetlock: tension or strain.  
Energetic blockage: emotional numbness or holding back.  
Energetic weakness: over-sensitivity or depletion after overuse.

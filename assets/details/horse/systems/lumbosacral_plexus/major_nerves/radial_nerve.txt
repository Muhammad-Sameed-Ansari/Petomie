#Radial Nerve#

The radial nerve is the largest branch of the brachial plexus and the primary motor nerve of the forelimb extensors.  
It controls extension of the elbow, carpus, and digits.  
Energetically, it represents **expansion, outward strength, and confident movement**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from C7 to T1 spinal nerves via the brachial plexus.  
Energetically, it connects higher awareness to purposeful action.

##Pathway##  
Runs along the triceps and down the lateral aspect of the limb.  
Energetically, it mirrors the outward flow of power and motion.

##Branches##  
Supplies triceps, extensors, and skin of the lateral forelimb.  
Energetically, these express confidence, openness, and movement without restraint.

###Function###  
The radial nerve extends the forelimb and allows forward propulsion.  
Energetically, it governs confidence, progress, and external expression of inner power.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dropped elbow or knuckling: nerve injury or compression.  
Loss of extension: muscular fatigue or energetic blockage.  
Pain along lateral limb: inflammation or trauma.  
Energetic weakness: hesitation or suppressed willpower.  
Energetic overload: pushing forward without rest.

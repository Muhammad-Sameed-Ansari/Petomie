#Brachial Plexus#

The brachial plexus is a complex network of nerves arising from the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal nerves.  
It supplies the forelimb, shoulder, and chest with both motor and sensory fibers.  
Energetically, it represents **coordination, communication, and flow of strength from heart to limb**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Formed by ventral branches of C6 to T2 spinal nerves.  
Energetically, it connects the upper spine’s clarity with the limbs’ expression and purpose.

##Structure##  
Divides into branches that merge and separate into individual nerves.  
Energetically, this interconnection reflects cooperation and unity in action.

##Major Branches##  
Gives rise to the suprascapular, musculocutaneous, radial, median, and ulnar nerves.  
Energetically, they symbolize different aspects of movement, touch, and communication.

###Function###  
The brachial plexus distributes nerve signals that control muscle movement and sensation in the forelimb.  
Energetically, it harmonizes intention and action, translating inner will into graceful motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness or paralysis of forelimb: trauma or compression.  
Pain in shoulder or upper limb: inflammation or tension.  
Numbness: disrupted communication or blocked flow.  
Energetic blockage: difficulty expressing purpose or direction.  
Energetic overload: overexertion or emotional tension in giving.

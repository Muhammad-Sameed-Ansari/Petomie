##Sacral Plexus (L5–S5)##

#Location#  
Formed by the ventral branches of the fifth lumbar (L5) to fifth sacral (S5) spinal nerves.  
Located on the ventral surface of the sacrum and within the pelvic cavity, lying near the internal iliac vessels and caudal to the lumbosacral junction.  
Gives rise to major nerves supplying the pelvic limb, perineum, and tail.

#Shape#  
A dense, fan-shaped network of interconnected nerve roots.  
Its branches unite and diverge before forming several large mixed nerves that exit the pelvic region through the greater sciatic foramen and other openings.

#Parts#  
- L5–S2: Contribute mainly to the sciatic nerve and its branches (tibial and peroneal).  
- S2–S4: Form the pudendal and pelvic nerves controlling the perineal region and visceral functions.  
- S4–S5: Contribute to caudal (coccygeal) nerves supplying the tail and anal region.

#Function#  
Provides motor and sensory innervation to the pelvic limb, perineum, pelvic organs, and tail.  
Controls hindlimb movement, tail motion, and reflexes related to urination, defecation, and reproduction.

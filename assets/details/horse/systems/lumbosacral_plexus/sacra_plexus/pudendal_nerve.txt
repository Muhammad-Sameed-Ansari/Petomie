#Pudendal Nerve#

The pudendal nerve supplies the perineum, external genitalia, and parts of the urinary and reproductive systems.  
It controls sphincter muscles and contributes to sensory awareness of these regions.  
Energetically, it represents **privacy, protection, and grounding in physical presence**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from sacral spinal nerves (S2–S4).  
Energetically, it links the base of the spine to grounding and personal security.

##Pathway##  
Travels through the pelvic canal toward the perineal region.  
Energetically, it symbolizes the root of instinct and creative energy.

##Branches##  
Includes perineal, dorsal, and caudal rectal nerves.  
Energetically, they reflect cleansing, reproduction, and deep connection to life force.

###Function###  
The pudendal nerve governs urinary and reproductive control and sensory function of the genital area.  
Energetically, it anchors life force, maintaining healthy boundaries and trust in embodiment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Incontinence or tension: disrupted pelvic nerve tone.  
Pain in perineal area: compression or emotional trauma.  
Reduced sensitivity: energetic disconnection or fear-based suppression.  
Energetic blockage: shame or unresolved emotional memory.  
Energetic weakness: loss of grounding or trust in physical form.

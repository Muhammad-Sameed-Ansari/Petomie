#Sciatic Nerve#

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the horse’s body, running from the pelvis down the hind limb.  
It powers major muscles and provides sensation to the leg.  
Energetically, it represents **strength, endurance, and the will to move forward**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Formed from the lumbosacral trunk (L6–S2).  
Energetically, it connects root stability with forward momentum.

##Pathway##  
Travels deep through the hip muscles and splits into tibial and peroneal nerves.  
Energetically, it represents flow from inner power to external action.

##Branches##  
Innervate hamstrings, lower leg, and foot regions.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding and dynamic strength.

###Function###  
The sciatic nerve enables hind limb movement, propulsion, and coordination.  
Energetically, it sustains **progress, perseverance, and grounding**, supporting both strength and stability.

###Common Imbalances###  
Lameness or dragging limb: nerve damage or compression.  
Pain in croup or leg: tension, inflammation, or emotional pressure.  
Numbness or weakness: blocked energy or poor circulation.  
Energetic blockage: fear of progress or instability.  
Energetic overload: overexertion or unbalanced drive.

#Gluteal Nerves#

The gluteal nerves supply the muscles of the hip and upper hind limb.  
They contribute to the movement and stability of the pelvis and propulsion during motion.  
Energetically, they represent **power, stability, and propulsion**, the force that drives the body forward.

###Parts###

##Cranial Gluteal Nerve##  
Innervates the middle and deep gluteal muscles and tensor fasciae latae.  
Energetically, it symbolizes forward drive and strength through purpose.

##Caudal Gluteal Nerve##  
Supplies the superficial gluteal and parts of the biceps femoris.  
Energetically, it reflects grounded confidence and the will to act.

##Branches##  
Spread through the pelvic muscles to coordinate balance and propulsion.  
Energetically, they unify intention and grounded movement.

###Function###  
The gluteal nerves power extension of the hip and stability of the hindquarters.  
Energetically, they embody **momentum and motivation**, transforming stored energy into graceful motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak hip extension: nerve strain or pelvic restriction.  
Pain or tension in croup: muscular tightness or emotional resistance.  
Uneven movement: imbalance in pelvic energy.  
Energetic blockage: lack of drive or loss of enthusiasm.  
Energetic overload: excessive tension or forced exertion.

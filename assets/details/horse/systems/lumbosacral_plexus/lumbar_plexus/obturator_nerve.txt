#Obturator Nerve#

The obturator nerve runs along the inner thigh and supplies muscles that adduct the limb.  
It helps control inward movement and stability, especially during standing or walking.  
Energetically, it represents **balance, cooperation, and centered strength**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from lumbar nerves (L4–L6).  
Energetically, it connects inner power to grounded alignment.

##Pathway##  
Passes through the obturator foramen to the inner thigh muscles.  
Energetically, it represents flow through inner channels of control and stability.

##Branches##  
Supplies the adductor, gracilis, and pectineus muscles.  
Energetically, these branches reflect unity, balance, and controlled movement.

###Function###  
The obturator nerve allows the horse to draw the hind limbs inward and maintain balance.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Difficulty adducting limb: nerve compression or pelvic misalignment.  
Weak inner thigh: muscular atrophy or energetic disconnection.  
Pain in groin: strain or emotional tension.  
Energetic blockage: lack of balance or feeling unsupported.  
Energetic weakness: hesitation or loss of stability in decisions.

#Femoral Nerve#

The femoral nerve is a major branch of the lumbar plexus, extending down the front of the thigh.  
It is responsible for powering the muscles that extend the hind limb and for sensation on the front of the thigh and lower leg.  
Energetically, it represents **forward movement, strength, and confidence**, guiding purposeful steps in life.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from the lumbar spinal nerves (L4–L6).  
Energetically, it connects the lower back’s stability with movement and direction.

##Pathway##  
Passes through the psoas and along the inner thigh before dividing near the stifle.  
Energetically, it symbolizes flow from core strength to external action.

##Branches##  
Supplies the quadriceps, sartorius, and skin of the medial limb.  
Energetically, these branches reflect cooperation between power and grace.

###Function###  
The femoral nerve controls extension of the stifle and sensation along the front and inner leg.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak stifle extension: nerve compression or lumbar tension.  
Reduced sensation in thigh: circulation or nerve entrapment.  
Pain in groin or thigh: muscular tightness or emotional strain.  
Energetic blockage: fear of moving forward.  
Energetic weakness: loss of motivation or confidence in steps.

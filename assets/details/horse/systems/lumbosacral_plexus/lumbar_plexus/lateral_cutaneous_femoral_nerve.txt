#Lateral Cutaneous Femoral Nerve#

The lateral cutaneous femoral nerve is a sensory branch arising from the lumbar plexus.  
It supplies the outer thigh, providing sensation and awareness of movement.  
Energetically, it represents **awareness of boundaries and sensitivity to direction**.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Emerges from lumbar nerves (L3–L4) and travels across the pelvic region.  
Energetically, it connects the core with external awareness and self-orientation.

##Pathway##  
Runs along the flank and over the hip toward the outer thigh.  
Energetically, it reflects movement between stability and freedom.

##Sensory Field##  
Supplies the lateral skin of the thigh.  
Energetically, this field symbolizes protection of personal space and external sensitivity.

###Function###  
Provides sensory feedback from the outer thigh and flank.  
Energetically, it supports perception and adaptability, helping the horse sense its physical and energetic boundaries.

###Common Imbalances###  
Numbness or tingling: pressure or pelvic imbalance.  
Sensitivity or twitching: overstimulation or emotional alertness.  
Pain along hip: tension in surrounding fascia.  
Energetic blockage: difficulty defining personal space.  
Energetic overload: hyper-reactivity or boundary confusion.

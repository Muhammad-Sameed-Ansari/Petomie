#Lumbosacral Plexus#

##Location##
The lumbosacral plexus in the horse is located in the **lower back and pelvic region**.  
It is formed by the **ventral branches of spinal nerves L4 to S5**.  
This network lies deep within the muscles of the lower lumbar and sacral area, and its branches extend to the **hindquarters, thighs, legs, and tail**.

###Shape###
A strong and complex **bundle of nerve fibers** where several spinal nerves merge and then divide into branches.  
These branches spread to supply the large muscles and skin of the hind limbs, pelvis, and perineal region.

##Function##
The lumbosacral plexus controls **movement and sensation** in the horse’s hind limbs and pelvic area.  
It carries **motor signals** to the muscles responsible for standing, walking, trotting, and kicking, and **sensory signals** back to the brain for touch, pressure, and limb position.

Main nerves from the lumbosacral plexus include:  
- **Femoral Nerve:** extends the stifle and supports weight-bearing during movement.  
- **Obturator Nerve:** controls the inner thigh muscles that pull the leg inward; important for balance when standing.  
- **Sciatic Nerve:** the largest nerve; supplies the hind limb, branching into:  
  - **Tibial Nerve:** runs down the back of the leg, controlling the hock and hoof flexors.  
  - **Peroneal (Fibular) Nerve:** runs along the outer leg, lifting and extending the hoof.  
- **Gluteal Nerves (Cranial and Caudal):** move and stabilize the hip and croup muscles.  
- **Pudendal Nerve:** serves the pelvic floor, perineum, and genital area.  
- **Caudal Rectal Nerve:** controls muscles of the anus and nearby skin sensation.  

##Examples##
When a horse pushes off the ground, kicks, or lifts a hind leg, the lumbosacral plexus coordinates those movements.  
It also provides the feeling of balance, pressure, and touch through the hindquarters and tail.

##Notes##
Damage or pinching in this area may lead to weakness, stumbling, or dragging of the hind limbs.  
Regular stretching, proper saddle fit, and avoiding strain help maintain healthy nerve flow and coordination in this region.

##Major Nerves (Femoral, Obturator, Sciatic, Pudendal)##

#Location#  
Arise from the lumbosacral plexus, which originates from the ventral branches of spinal nerves L4–S3.  
Located within the pelvic and upper hindlimb region, coursing through the pelvis and thigh to innervate muscles and skin of the hindlimb and perineal area.

#Shape#  
Thick, cord-like bundles of mixed motor and sensory fibers, branching to supply the pelvic limb.  
Each nerve has a distinct path and target region, coordinating locomotion and sensory perception.

#Parts#  
1. Femoral Nerve – Arises from L4–L6; passes through the iliopsoas; supplies quadriceps femoris and skin of medial thigh and leg via the saphenous branch.  
2. Obturator Nerve – From L4–L6; exits through the obturator foramen; innervates adductor muscles of the thigh (gracilis, adductor, pectineus).  
3. Sciatic Nerve – Largest nerve; from L6–S2; passes caudal to the femur; divides into tibial and peroneal branches; supplies hamstrings and all structures distal to the stifle.  
4. Pudendal Nerve – From S2–S4; located in the pelvic canal; supplies perineal muscles, anal sphincter, external genitalia, and skin around the anus.

#Function#  
Provide motor control and sensory feedback to the hindlimb and perineal region.  
Coordinate movement of the hip, thigh, stifle, hock, and tail, while maintaining sensation and voluntary control of urination and defecation.

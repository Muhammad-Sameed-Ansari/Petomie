##Parts##

###1. Adipose Tissue###
- Fat cells distributed under the dermis.  
- **Function:** Stores energy and provides insulation.  

###2. Connective Fibers###
- Collagen and elastin fibers forming the framework.  
- **Function:** Maintain flexibility and shock absorption.  

###3. Blood Vessels###
- Extensive network supplying the upper skin layers.  
- **Function:** Regulate temperature and transport nutrients.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Cushions muscles and bones.  
- **Thermoregulation:** Retains body heat and energy.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows skin to move freely with underlying structures.

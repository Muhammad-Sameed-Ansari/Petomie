#Hypodermis#

The hypodermis, or subcutaneous layer, lies beneath the dermis and connects the skin to muscles and deeper tissues.  
It consists mainly of fat and connective tissue that cushions, insulates, and stores energy.  
Energetically, it symbolizes grounding, comfort, and deep-rooted stability.

###Parts###

##Adipose Tissue##  
Stores fat to regulate body temperature and provide energy reserves.  
Energetically, it represents security and nourishment, helping maintain emotional warmth.

##Connective Tissue Fibers##  
Anchor the skin to underlying structures and support movement.  
Energetically, they represent integration — linking surface awareness to inner power.

##Blood and Lymph Vessels##  
Supply and cleanse the deeper skin layers.  
Energetically, they express gentle flow, detoxification, and grounding of life energy.

###Function###  
The hypodermis protects muscles, regulates temperature, and cushions against external impact.  
Energetically, it acts as the root of the skin system — stabilizing emotions and absorbing shock during stress.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling or Edema: lymphatic stagnation or emotional heaviness.  
Fat Depletion: malnutrition or lack of grounding.  
Excess Fat Buildup: protective emotional layer from stress or fear.  
Coldness or Poor Circulation: reduced energy flow or physical inactivity.

#Integumentary System – Epidermis (Horse)#

##Location##
The epidermis forms the **outermost layer** of the horse’s skin, covering the entire body including the face, limbs, and muzzle.  
It lies above the dermis and acts as a protective barrier against external elements.

##Shape##
A **thin, keratinized epithelial layer** that constantly renews.  
Thicker on high-friction areas such as the muzzle and legs, and thinner on the flanks and inner thighs.

##Parts##

###1. Stratum Corneum###
- Outer layer made of flattened, dead keratinized cells.  
- **Function:** Provides waterproofing and mechanical protection.  

###2. Stratum Basale###
- Deepest layer where cell division occurs.  
- **Function:** Renews skin cells and contributes to healing.  

###3. Melanocytes###
- Pigment-producing cells within the basal layer.  
- **Function:** Protect against UV light and give coat coloration.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Acts as a physical and chemical barrier.  
- **Water balance:** Prevents dehydration.  
- **Regeneration:** Continuously replaces damaged cells.

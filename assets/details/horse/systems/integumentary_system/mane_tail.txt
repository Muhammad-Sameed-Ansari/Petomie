#Integumentary System – Mane and Tail (Horse)#

##Location##  
The **mane** extends along the **crest of the neck**, from poll to withers.  
The **tail** is located at the **caudal end of the body**, extending from the dock (tail base) to the long flowing hairs.  
Both are attached to skin structures connected to the **dermis** and **hypodermis** layers.

##Shape##  
Composed of **long, coarse, keratinized hairs** growing from follicles embedded in the dermis.  
The mane grows vertically along the neck crest, while the tail grows downward from the dock.  
Each hair is thick, durable, and continually growing, offering mechanical protection and aiding in communication.

#Dermis#

The dermis is the middle layer of the horse’s skin, lying beneath the epidermis and supporting it with strength, elasticity, and nourishment.  
It holds nerves, blood vessels, and glands, forming the living foundation of touch and temperature regulation.  
Energetically, it represents stability, sensitivity, and emotional grounding.

###Parts###

##Connective Tissue##  
Dense fibers of collagen and elastin provide structure and flexibility.  
Energetically, these fibers reflect resilience and the ability to stay centered under pressure.

##Blood Vessels##  
Carry oxygen and nutrients to the skin and remove waste products.  
Energetically, they represent flow and nourishment — the lifeblood of emotional and physical health.

##Nerve Endings##  
Transmit sensations of touch, pressure, pain, and temperature.  
Energetically, they symbolize perception, awareness, and intuitive response to surroundings.

##Sweat and Sebaceous Glands##  
Regulate temperature and secrete natural oils to keep the coat healthy.  
Energetically, they represent release, cleansing, and balance.

###Function###  
The dermis supports temperature control, sensation, and regeneration.  
It anchors hair follicles and allows communication between body and environment.  
Energetically, it is the layer of empathy, connection, and feeling safety within physical form.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: irritation or infection, often linked to emotional stress.  
Loss of Elasticity: aging or poor hydration.  
Sensitivity or Pain: nerve irritation or over-reactive energy field.  
Swelling or Redness: stagnation or unprocessed emotions rising to the surface.  
Poor Circulation: weak energy flow or physical restriction.

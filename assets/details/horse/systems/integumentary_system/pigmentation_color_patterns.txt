#Pigmentation and Color Patterns#

Pigmentation defines a horse’s color, markings, and patterns through the distribution of melanin and other pigments in the skin and hair.  
It serves both biological protection and visual communication.  
Energetically, pigmentation reflects individuality, expression, and the unique signature of the soul.

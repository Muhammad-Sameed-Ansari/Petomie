#Whiskers (Vibrissae)#

Whiskers, or vibrissae, are long tactile hairs around the horse’s muzzle and eyes.  
They detect objects and textures close to the face, allowing navigation and safety.  
Energetically, they symbolize intuition, perception, and energetic feelers reaching into the world.

###Parts###

##Muzzle Vibrissae##  
Located around the nose and mouth, sensing texture, shape, and distance.  
Energetically, they represent grounded intuition and exploration.

##Eye Vibrissae##  
Protect the eyes by detecting nearby objects.  
Energetically, they embody alertness and foresight.

##Nerve Networks##  
Highly sensitive roots connected to the brain for rapid sensory feedback.  
Energetically, they symbolize connection between inner knowing and outer awareness.

###Function###  
Whiskers protect from injury and guide feeding, movement, and contact.  
Energetically, they help the horse navigate relationships, space, and emotion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Whisker Removal: reduced sensory input and energetic disconnection.  
Dull Response: nerve fatigue or stress.  
Sensitivity or Twitching: overstimulation or heightened emotional alert.

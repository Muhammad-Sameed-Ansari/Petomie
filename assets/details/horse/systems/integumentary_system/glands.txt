#Glands#

The glands of the horse’s skin play vital roles in secretion, lubrication, and temperature control.  
They are key to maintaining balance between protection and elimination.  
Energetically, they represent communication, expression, and the body’s ability to release what is no longer needed.

###Parts###

##Sebaceous Glands##  
Produce sebum, an oily substance that keeps skin and hair soft.  
Energetically, they symbolize natural protection and inner nourishment.

##Sweat Glands##  
Aid cooling and toxin elimination through perspiration.  
Energetically, they represent cleansing, letting go, and emotional release.

##Scent Glands##  
Used for marking and communication between horses.  
Energetically, they reflect individuality and personal space boundaries.

###Function###  
Skin glands maintain coat condition, regulate temperature, and communicate through scent.  
Energetically, they mirror the balance of expression, purification, and self-maintenance.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blocked Glands: stagnation, toxins, or emotional suppression.  
Overactive Sweat: stress response or inner heat.  
Greasy Coat: overproduction of oil, reflecting internal imbalance.  
Dryness: lack of fluids or reduced energetic flow.

#Veins#

##Location##
Veins are **thin-walled vessels** that carry **oxygen-poor blood back to the heart**.  
They are located throughout the horse’s body and usually lie closer to the skin’s surface than arteries.

##Shape##
Veins have **thin, flexible walls** and contain **valves** that prevent blood from flowing backward.  
They are less muscular than arteries and carry blood under lower pressure.

##Parts##

###1. Vena Cava (Cranial & Caudal)###
- The largest veins in the body.  
- **Function:** Return blood from the upper and lower body to the right atrium.  

###2. Pulmonary Veins###
- Carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium.  
- **Function:** Complete the oxygenation cycle.  

###3. Jugular Veins###
- Found on both sides of the neck.  
- **Function:** Drain blood from the head and brain.  

###4. Femoral Veins###
- Found in the hind limbs.  
- **Function:** Return blood from the legs to the heart.  

###5. Renal Veins###
- Connected to the kidneys.  
- **Function:** Return filtered blood to circulation.  

###6. Coronary Veins###
- Found around the heart.  
- **Function:** Drain deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle.  

##Function##
- **Return flow:** Carry blood back to the heart for re-oxygenation.  
- **Waste transport:** Carry carbon dioxide and waste to be removed from the body.  
- **Storage:** Contain most of the body’s blood volume when at rest.  
- **Temperature regulation:** Adjust blood flow near the skin to manage body temperature.

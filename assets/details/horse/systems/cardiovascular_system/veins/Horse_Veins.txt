#Veins#

##Location##
Form an extensive, low-pressure network that returns deoxygenated blood from tissues and organs back to the heart.
Major veins accompany arteries throughout the body and drain into progressively larger vessels leading to the cranial and caudal vena cava.
- **Cranial Vena Cava:** Collects blood from the head, neck, and forelimbs.
- **Caudal Vena Cava:** Drains blood from the abdomen, pelvis, and hindlimbs.
Superficial veins such as the jugular, cephalic, and saphenous are easily visible and used clinically for venipuncture.
Deep veins run parallel to arteries within muscles and organ systems.

##Shape##
Thin-walled, collapsible tubular vessels with larger diameters than arteries.
- **Tunica Intima:** Inner smooth endothelial lining with valves to prevent backflow.
- **Tunica Media:** Thin layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue permitting slight constriction.
- **Tunica Externa:** Outer connective tissue sheath providing structural support.
- **Valves:** Present in many veins, especially of limbs, ensuring one-way flow toward the heart.
- **Color & Texture:** Dark bluish-purple when filled with deoxygenated blood, soft and flexible compared to arteries.

##Function##
Return blood to the heart for reoxygenation and maintain circulation balance.
- **Collect deoxygenated blood** from capillaries and transport it back to the heart.
- **Serve as blood reservoirs**, storing up to 60–70% of total blood volume.
- **Maintain venous return** during movement through muscular contraction and valve action.
- **Facilitate thermoregulation** by adjusting blood distribution between superficial and deep vessels.
- **Assist in nutrient and waste transport** between organs and systemic circulation.

#Pericardium#

The horse’s pericardium is the protective double-walled sac that surrounds the heart.  
It cushions, stabilizes, and shields the heart from friction and external pressure.  
Energetically, it represents protection, emotional boundaries, and the safe container for the heart’s expression.

###Parts###

##Fibrous Pericardium##  
The strong outer layer anchoring the heart in place.  
Energetically, it symbolizes stability and grounded protection.

##Serous Pericardium##  
A delicate double layer that reduces friction during heartbeats.  
Energetically, it reflects softness, flow, and emotional ease.

##Pericardial Cavity##  
A fluid-filled space allowing smooth movement.  
Energetically, it represents spaciousness and gentle buffering.

###Function###  
The pericardium protects the heart, maintains its position, and reduces friction.  
Energetically, it supports emotional safety, healthy boundaries, and balanced expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: restricted movement or discomfort.  
Fluid buildup: pressure on the heart.  
Thickening: decreased flexibility.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from emotional overwhelm or boundary issues.

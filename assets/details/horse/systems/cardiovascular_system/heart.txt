#Heart#

##Location##
The horse’s heart is located in the **thoracic cavity**, between the lungs and slightly to the left side of the chest.  
It lies behind the elbow joint and is protected by the ribs.

##Shape##
The heart is a **large, cone-shaped muscular organ** with four chambers: two atria (upper) and two ventricles (lower).  
It weighs about 3.5 to 4.5 kg in an average-sized horse and is enclosed in a fibrous sac called the **pericardium**.

##Parts##

###1. Right Atrium###
- Receives oxygen-poor blood from the body through large veins.  

###2. Right Ventricle###
- Pumps blood to the lungs via the **pulmonary artery** to receive oxygen.  

###3. Left Atrium###
- Collects oxygen-rich blood from the lungs through the **pulmonary veins**.  

###4. Left Ventricle###
- The strongest chamber that pumps oxygenated blood through the **aorta** to the rest of the body.  

###5. Heart Valves###
- Include the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves.  
- **Function:** Keep blood flowing in one direction and prevent backflow.  

###6. Pericardium###
- A protective sac surrounding the heart.  
- **Function:** Reduces friction and anchors the heart in place.  

##Function##
- **Circulation:** Pumps blood through the lungs and body.  
- **Oxygenation:** Sends blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and back to the tissues.  
- **Pressure maintenance:** Keeps blood flowing evenly through vessels.  
- **Waste transport:** Removes carbon dioxide and metabolic waste.

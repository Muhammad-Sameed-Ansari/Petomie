#Capillaries#

##Location##
Capillaries are **microscopic blood vessels** found throughout the horse’s body.  
They connect **arteries and veins**, forming dense networks in tissues and organs such as the **lungs, muscles, kidneys, intestines, and skin**.

##Shape##
Capillaries are **extremely thin and delicate**, made of a single layer of endothelial cells.  
Their walls allow easy exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between blood and body tissues.

##Parts##

###1. Arterioles###
- Small branches of arteries that lead to capillaries.  
- **Function:** Control blood flow into capillary beds.  

###2. Venules###
- Small vessels that collect blood from capillaries and carry it to veins.  
- **Function:** Transport deoxygenated blood back to the heart.  

###3. Capillary Beds###
- Networks of tiny capillaries within tissues.  
- **Function:** Exchange oxygen, nutrients, and waste between blood and cells.  

###4. Endothelial Cells###
- Form the walls of capillaries.  
- **Function:** Allow diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients.  

##Function##
- **Gas exchange:** Deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.  
- **Nutrient transport:** Supply nutrients and hormones to body tissues.  
- **Waste removal:** Carry away waste and toxins.  
- **Fluid balance:** Maintain hydration between blood and tissues.  
- **Temperature control:** Help regulate body heat through surface circulation.

#Capillaries#

The **horse’s capillaries** form vast microscopic networks connecting arteries and veins.  
They are the bridge of exchange, where oxygen and nutrients meet tissues, and waste is collected for removal.  
Energetically, capillaries symbolize **connection, reciprocity, and balance**, uniting all systems in harmony.

###Parts###

##Arterioles##
Small branches from arteries leading into capillary beds.  
Energetically, symbolize **distribution and precision**.

##Capillary Beds##
Microscopic vessels allowing gas and nutrient exchange.  
Energetically, represent **communication and cooperation at the cellular level**.

##Venules##
Small vessels collecting blood from capillaries into veins.  
Energetically, embody **integration and renewal**.

###Function###
Capillaries exchange oxygen, nutrients, and waste between blood and tissues.  
They regulate microcirculation and tissue nourishment.  

Energetically, they express **oneness and harmony**, the meeting point of giving and receiving.

###Common Imbalances###
Weak flow: Cold extremities or muscle stiffness.  
Leakage: Inflammation or irritation.  
Energetic isolation: Lack of unity or disconnection from the whole.

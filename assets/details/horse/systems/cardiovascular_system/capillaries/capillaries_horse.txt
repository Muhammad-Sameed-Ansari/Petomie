#Capillaries#

##Location##
Present throughout all tissues and organs of the horse’s body, forming a dense network between arterioles and venules. They are especially abundant in metabolically active tissues such as muscles, lungs, kidneys, and intestines.

##Shape##
Microscopic, thin-walled blood vessels composed of a single layer of endothelial cells. They form interconnected networks (capillary beds) that facilitate exchange between blood and surrounding tissues. Capillaries vary in type:
- **Continuous Capillaries:** Found in muscle and skin; have tightly joined endothelial cells.
- **Fenestrated Capillaries:** Present in kidneys and intestines; contain small pores for greater permeability.
- **Sinusoidal Capillaries:** Found in the liver and spleen; have wide, irregular lumens allowing passage of larger molecules and cells.

##Function##
Enable the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste products between blood and tissues
Regulate tissue perfusion and maintain cellular metabolism
Assist in thermoregulation by adjusting blood flow near the skin surface
Play a critical role in healing, inflammation, and fluid balance within tissues
Serve as the transition link between arterial and venous circulation

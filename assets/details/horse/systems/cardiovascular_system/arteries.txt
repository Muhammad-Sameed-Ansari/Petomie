#Arteries#

##Location##
Arteries are **thick, muscular blood vessels** that carry **oxygen-rich blood away from the heart** to all parts of the horse’s body.  
They are found deep within the body and branch into smaller arterioles that lead to capillaries.

##Shape##
Arteries have **strong, elastic walls** that stretch with each heartbeat.  
They can adjust their diameter to control blood flow and pressure.

##Parts##

###1. Aorta###
- The largest artery leaving the left ventricle.  
- **Function:** Carries oxygen-rich blood to the entire body.  

###2. Pulmonary Arteries###
- Carry oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.  
- **Function:** Allow gas exchange to occur in the lungs.  

###3. Coronary Arteries###
- Found on the surface of the heart.  
- **Function:** Supply blood and oxygen directly to the heart muscle.  

###4. Carotid Arteries###
- Found on both sides of the neck.  
- **Function:** Deliver oxygen-rich blood to the head and brain.  

###5. Femoral Arteries###
- Found in the inner thighs.  
- **Function:** Supply blood to the hind limbs.  

###6. Renal Arteries###
- Connected to the kidneys.  
- **Function:** Deliver blood for filtration and waste removal.  

##Function##
- **Transport:** Carry oxygen and nutrients throughout the body.  
- **Pressure regulation:** Control blood pressure and distribution.  
- **Support:** Assist in body temperature regulation by changing blood flow.

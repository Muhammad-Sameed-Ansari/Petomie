A broad, coiled tube (around 7 meters long) specialized for fermentation and water absorption.

##Parts##
- **Cecum:** Large fermentation chamber where fibrous material is broken down by microbes.  
- **Large Colon:** Absorbs nutrients from fermentation, especially volatile fatty acids.  
- **Small Colon:** Absorbs remaining water and forms fecal balls.  
- **Rectum:** Temporary storage before elimination.

##Function##
- Ferments fibrous plant material with bacteria to produce energy.  
- Absorbs water, electrolytes, and nutrients from digesta.

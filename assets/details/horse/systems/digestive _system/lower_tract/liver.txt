#Liver#

##Location##
Lies in the upper right part of the abdomen, just behind the diaphragm and in front of the stomach.

##Shape##
A large, reddish-brown, multi-lobed organ. Horses do not have a gallbladder, so bile flows continuously into the intestine.

##Parts##
- **Lobes:** Left, right, quadrate, and caudate.  
- **Bile Ducts:** Deliver bile to the duodenum.  
- **Blood Vessels:** Supply nutrients and oxygen.  

##Function##
- Produces bile to help digest fats.  
- Stores vitamins, glycogen, and minerals.  
- Detoxifies chemicals and filters blood.  
- Regulates metabolism and nutrient balance.  
- Supports continuous bile flow for fiber digestion (no gallbladder).

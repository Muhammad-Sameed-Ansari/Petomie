#Oral Cavity#

##Location##
Situated at the front of the digestive tract, extending from the lips to the pharynx. In the horse, the oral cavity is bounded by the lips, cheeks, palate, and tongue, forming the entry point for food and water intake.

##Shape##
A spacious chamber adapted for grasping, chewing, and initial digestion:
- **Lips:** Mobile and sensitive, essential for prehension of feed; the upper lip is particularly flexible.  
- **Cheeks:** Form the lateral walls, lined with mucous membranes and containing salivary openings.  
- **Hard Palate:** Bony, ridged roof aiding in food manipulation.  
- **Soft Palate:** Caudal muscular continuation separating the oral and nasal cavities.  
- **Tongue:** Large, muscular organ covered with papillae for taste and texture sensation; aids in chewing and swallowing.  
- **Teeth:** Hypsodont (continuously erupting) teeth designed for grinding fibrous feed.  
- **Gums and Mucosa:** Provide support and lubrication during mastication.  

##Function##
Prehends and ingests food using lips and tongue
Grinds feed through coordinated movement of the jaws and teeth
Mixes food with saliva to begin enzymatic digestion
Forms and propels the food bolus toward the pharynx for swallowing
Plays a role in taste, communication, and sensory feedback during feeding

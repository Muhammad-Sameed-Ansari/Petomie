#Accessory Organs#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the head and abdominal regions, the accessory digestive organs include the liver, pancreas, and salivary glands. These organs are located adjacent to or connected with the main digestive tract, contributing essential secretions and functions for digestion and metabolism.

##Shape##
- **Liver:** Large, multilobed organ situated just behind the diaphragm, predominantly on the right side of the abdomen. It connects to the duodenum via the bile duct.  
- **Pancreas:** Flattened, lobulated gland located between the duodenum and stomach, extending toward the spleen.  
- **Salivary Glands:** Parotid, mandibular, and sublingual glands distributed around the jaw and throat region, each with ducts opening into the mouth.  
- **Duct Systems:** Network of fine tubes carrying bile and pancreatic secretions to the small intestine.  
- **Vascular Supply:** Richly supplied with blood vessels to support metabolic and secretory activity.  

##Function##
- **Liver:** Produces bile for fat digestion, detoxifies metabolites, and stores nutrients.  
- **Pancreas:** Secretes digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, protease) and hormones (insulin, glucagon) for metabolism.  
- **Salivary Glands:** Produce saliva to moisten and lubricate food, aiding chewing and swallowing.  
- **General Role:** Support and regulate the digestive process by providing enzymes, bile, and moisture.  
- Maintain metabolic balance and nutrient processing throughout the body.

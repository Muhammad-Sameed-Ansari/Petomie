#Respiratory System – Lower Tract#

##Location##
The lower respiratory tract includes the **bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, alveoli, diaphragm, and pleura**.  
It occupies the **thoracic cavity**, protected by the ribs and sternum.

##Shape##
A system of branching tubes ending in clusters of air sacs, surrounded by elastic lung tissue for efficient breathing and gas exchange.

##Parts##

###1. Bronchi###
- Two main tubes branching from the trachea.  
- **Function:** Carry air to each lung.  

###2. Bronchioles###
- Smaller airways branching throughout the lung tissue.  
- **Function:** Regulate airflow and distribute air evenly.  

###3. Alveoli###
- Microscopic sacs surrounded by capillaries.  
- **Function:** Exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between air and blood.  

###4. Lungs###
- Two large organs filling most of the chest cavity.  
- **Function:** Oxygenate blood and remove carbon dioxide.  

###5. Diaphragm###
- Large muscular sheet separating the chest and abdomen.  
- **Function:** Expands and contracts to draw air in and push it out.  

###6. Pleura###
- Thin double-layered membrane surrounding the lungs.  
- **Function:** Reduces friction and protects the lungs.  

##Function##
- **Gas exchange:** Provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide.  
- **Ventilation:** Controls air movement in and out of the lungs.  
- **Elastic support:** Maintains lung shape and volume.  
- **Efficiency:** Allows powerful, rapid breathing during running.

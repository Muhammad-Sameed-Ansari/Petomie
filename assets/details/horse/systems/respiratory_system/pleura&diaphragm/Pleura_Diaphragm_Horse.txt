#Pleura & Diaphragm#

##Location##
The pleura and diaphragm are essential thoracic structures forming boundaries and linings for respiration.  
- **Pleura:** Lines the thoracic cavity and covers the lungs. It forms two continuous layers — parietal (lining the chest wall) and visceral (covering the lung surface).  
- **Diaphragm:** A dome-shaped muscular partition separating the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. It attaches to the lower ribs, sternum, and lumbar vertebrae.

##Shape##
- **Pleura:** Thin, smooth, serous membrane forming pleural sacs on both sides of the thorax.  
  - *Parietal Pleura:* Lines the ribs, mediastinum, and diaphragm.  
  - *Visceral Pleura:* Adheres to the surface of the lungs.  
  - *Pleural Cavity:* Potential space between layers containing a small amount of lubricating fluid.  
- **Diaphragm:** Broad, dome-shaped musculotendinous sheet with:  
  - *Central Tendon:* Fibrous center anchoring muscle fibers.  
  - *Muscular Portions:* Costal, sternal, and lumbar parts.  
  - *Openings:* Aortic hiatus, esophageal hiatus, and caval foramen for passage of major vessels and organs.

##Function##
- **Pleura:**  
  - Reduces friction between the lungs and chest wall during breathing.  
  - Maintains negative pressure essential for lung inflation.  
  - Provides a smooth, protective lining for thoracic structures.  
- **Diaphragm:**  
  - Primary muscle of inspiration, contracting to enlarge the thoracic cavity.  
  - Separates thoracic and abdominal organs while allowing passage through its openings.  
  - Assists in abdominal pressure changes during breathing, defecation, and foaling.  
  - Supports venous return to the heart through its rhythmic movement.

#Guttural Pouches#

The horse’s guttural pouches are large, air-filled extensions of the Eustachian tubes located between the skull and throat.  
They help cool major blood vessels, regulate pressure, and support upper airway function.  
Energetically, they represent balance, internal regulation, and the harmony between breath and clarity.

###Parts###

##Medial Compartment##  
The larger inner chamber on each side, closely associated with major arteries and nerves.  
Energetically, it symbolizes inner stability and deep regulation.

##Lateral Compartment##  
The smaller outer chamber separated by delicate bone and membrane.  
Energetically, it reflects outer balance and subtle adjustment.

##Eustachian Tube Opening##  
The connection to the pharynx that allows airflow and pressure equalization.  
Energetically, it represents exchange, release, and internal harmony.

###Function###  
The guttural pouches cool the blood traveling to the brain, regulate pressure within the upper airway, and may assist vocal resonance.  
They also cushion and protect delicate neurovascular structures in the head.  
Energetically, they support equilibrium, temperature balance, and smooth internal flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation or empyema: congestion, infection, or stagnation.  
Fungal infection: structural irritation or stress in surrounding tissues.  
Airflow restriction: tension or blockage.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from overwhelm, internal pressure, or disrupted balance.

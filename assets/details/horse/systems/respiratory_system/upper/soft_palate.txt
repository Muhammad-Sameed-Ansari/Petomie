#Soft Palate#

The horse’s soft palate is a muscular, flexible sheet separating the oral cavity from the nasal passages.  
It ensures that food and air travel along the correct pathways.  
Energetically, it represents coordination, boundaries, and the smooth transition between expression and breath.

###Parts###

##Palatine Muscular Layer##  
Provides movement and tension for swallowing.  
Energetically, it symbolizes adaptability and gentle support.

##Mucosal Surface##  
The soft, protective lining that maintains moisture and sensitivity.  
Energetically, it reflects sensitivity and intuitive awareness.

##Free Border##  
The caudal edge that moves during swallowing and airflow shifts.  
Energetically, it represents transition and choice.

###Function###  
The soft palate directs airflow into the nasal passages and prevents food from entering the airway.  
In horses, its long structure contributes to obligate nasal breathing.  
Energetically, it supports balance, smooth transitions, and ease of direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dorsal displacement: airway noise or exercise intolerance.  
Inflammation: irritation or blockage.  
Stiffness: difficulty coordinating breath and swallow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from disrupted boundaries or tension in transitions.

#Nasal Cavities#

The horse’s nasal cavities extend from the nostrils to the pharynx, separated by a nasal septum.  
They filter, warm, and moisten incoming air, preparing it for the lungs.  
Energetically, they represent balance, cleansing, and preparation for inspiration.

###Parts###

##Nasal Conchae (Turbinates)##  
Curved bones lined with mucosa that warm and humidify air.  
Energetically, they symbolize flow and harmony in transition.

##Nasal Septum##  
Divides the left and right cavities, maintaining airflow balance.  
Energetically, it reflects alignment and balance between polarities.

##Mucous Membrane##  
Produces mucus that traps dust and microbes.  
Energetically, it represents protection and purification.

###Function###  
The nasal cavities condition and filter air before it reaches the lungs.  
They regulate temperature, humidity, and protect deeper tissues from damage.  
Energetically, they balance intake and refinement, ensuring breath enters with purity and grace.

###Common Imbalances###  
Congestion: inflammation or energetic stagnation.  
Bleeding: irritation or dryness.  
Blocked airflow: swelling or emotional resistance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty receiving inspiration or internal imbalance.

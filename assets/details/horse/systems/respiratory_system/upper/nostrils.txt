#Nostrils#

The horse’s nostrils are large, flexible openings at the entrance of the respiratory system.  
They expand during inhalation to draw in air and contract to protect against dust and debris.  
Energetically, they symbolize openness, awareness, and the ability to receive life fully.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Rings##  
Provide structure and flexibility, allowing the nostrils to widen during exercise.

##Mucous Membranes##  
Moisten and filter air entering the respiratory tract.  
Energetically, they symbolize purification and emotional clarity.

##Nasal Hairs##  
Trap particles and protect deeper airways.  
Energetically, they embody sensitivity and subtle perception.

###Function###  
The nostrils regulate airflow, filter particles, and protect the respiratory tract.  
They also aid in smell, communication, and temperature adjustment of inhaled air.  
Energetically, they encourage mindfulness and presence, connecting the horse’s breath with awareness of its surroundings.

###Common Imbalances###

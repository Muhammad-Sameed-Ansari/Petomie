#Eustachian Tube#

The horse’s Eustachian tube is a narrow canal that connects the middle ear to the pharynx.  
It regulates air pressure, drains secretions, and provides airflow into the guttural pouches.  
Energetically, it represents balance, release, and the clear exchange between inner and outer worlds.

###Parts###

##Pharyngeal Opening##  
The entrance inside the throat that allows air to pass toward the middle ear and guttural pouches.  
Energetically, it symbolizes openness, communication, and flow.

##Cartilaginous Tube##  
A flexible channel that maintains structure while allowing controlled airflow.  
Energetically, it reflects adaptability and gentle support.

##Middle Ear Connection##  
The upper end that links to the tympanic cavity of the ear, regulating internal ear pressure.  
Energetically, it represents harmony, equilibrium, and inner tuning.

###Function###  
The Eustachian tube equalizes pressure in the middle ear, allows drainage of fluids, and ventilates the guttural pouches.  
It plays a key role in maintaining balance, hearing clarity, and upper airway health.  
Energetically, it supports smooth transitions, balanced perception, and release of internal tension.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blockage: pressure discomfort or reduced drainage.  
Inflammation: irritation from infection or congestion.  
Airflow restriction: difficulty regulating inner pressure.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from tension, holding on, or disrupted flow.

#Nasal Septum#

The horse’s nasal septum is the central wall of cartilage and bone that divides the nasal cavity into left and right passages.  
It supports airflow balance and structural stability within the nose.  
Energetically, it represents balance, boundaries, and centered flow.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Section##  
Flexible front portion that shapes the nasal opening.  
Energetically, it symbolizes adaptability and guided intake.

##Bony Section##  
Sturdy rear portion providing structure.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and inner alignment.

##Mucosal Lining##  
Soft surface that protects and maintains airflow health.  
Energetically, it represents sensitivity and smooth flow.

###Function###  
The nasal septum divides the nasal cavity, supporting even airflow and structural stability.  
Energetically, it encourages centeredness, balance, and harmonious intake of information.

###Common Imbalances###  
Deviation: uneven airflow.  
Inflammation: irritation or congestion.  
Thickening: reduced airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from imbalance, confusion, or disrupted direction.

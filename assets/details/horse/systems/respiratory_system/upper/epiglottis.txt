#Epiglottis#

The horse’s epiglottis is a leaf-shaped cartilage that protects the airway by covering the laryngeal opening during swallowing.  
It ensures that food is directed safely into the esophagus.  
Energetically, it represents protection, choice, and trust in the body’s flow.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Base##  
Provides structure and stability.  
Energetically, it symbolizes grounding and inner strength.

##Elastic Tip##  
Allows flexible movement during breathing and swallowing.  
Energetically, it reflects adaptability and responsiveness.

##Mucosal Surface##  
A smooth lining that reduces friction and protects tissue.  
Energetically, it represents gentle guidance and sensitivity.

###Function###  
The epiglottis prevents food and fluid from entering the airway and maintains proper airflow during breathing.  
Energetically, it supports protection, clarity of direction, and intuitive safety.

###Common Imbalances###  
Entrapment: noise, obstruction, or altered airflow.  
Inflammation: irritation from infection or tension.  
Reduced mobility: swallowing difficulty.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from feeling unprotected or overwhelmed.

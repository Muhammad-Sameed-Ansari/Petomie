#Ethmoid Turbinates#

The ethmoid turbinates are delicate, complex structures deep within the nasal cavity involved in smell and airflow refinement.  
They support olfaction and protect sensitive tissues.  
Energetically, they represent perception, intuition, and subtle awareness.

###Parts###

##Olfactory Lamellae##  
Fine structures that detect scent particles.  
Energetically, they symbolize intuition and perception.

##Ethmoidal Scrolls##  
Intricate bony folds that regulate airflow.  
Energetically, they reflect subtle guidance and balance.

##Sensitive Mucosa##  
The rich sensory lining supporting smell.  
Energetically, it represents emotional perception and inner knowing.

###Function###  
Ethmoid turbinates detect scents and refine airflow through the nasal cavity.  
Energetically, they enhance awareness, sensitivity, and refined perception.

###Common Imbalances###  
Fungal infection: tissue damage or irritation.  
Inflammation: altered smell or discomfort.  
Trauma: impaired airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from sensory overwhelm or unclear perception.

#Nasal Turbinates#

The horse’s nasal turbinates are curved, scroll-like bones inside the nasal passages that warm, humidify, and filter inhaled air.  
They play a vital role in conditioning air before it reaches the lungs.  
Energetically, they represent clarity, refinement, and gentle preparation.

###Parts###

##Dorsal Turbinates##  
Upper scrolls involved in filtering and airflow direction.  
Energetically, they symbolize clarity and higher awareness.

##Ventral Turbinates##  
Lower scrolls that warm and humidify incoming air.  
Energetically, they reflect grounding and nourishment.

##Mucosal Lining##  
A moist surface supporting filtration and sensitivity.  
Energetically, it represents intuitive cleansing and gentle flow.

###Function###  
The turbinates filter debris, warm the air, and regulate airflow patterns within the nasal passages.  
Energetically, they support clarity, purification, and smooth intake of experience.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: congestion or noisy breathing.  
Swelling: airflow restriction.  
Trauma: altered airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from unclear input or overstimulation.

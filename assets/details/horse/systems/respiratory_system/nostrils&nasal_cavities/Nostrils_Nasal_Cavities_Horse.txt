#Nostrils & Nasal Cavities#

##Location##
Located at the front of the horse’s face, the nostrils (nares) form the external openings of the respiratory tract leading into the nasal cavities. The paired nasal cavities extend caudally from the nostrils to the pharynx, divided by the nasal septum and bordered by facial bones.

##Shape##
- **Nostrils (Nares):**  
  - Large, oval, and highly flexible openings capable of wide dilation during exercise.  
  - Supported by the alar cartilages and surrounded by muscles that regulate airflow.  
  - Inner lining composed of fine hair and mucosa for filtering particles.  

- **Nasal Cavities:**  
  - Divided by the nasal septum into right and left chambers.  
  - Contain complex bony scrolls called *turbinates (conchae)* that increase surface area.  
  - Lined with ciliated mucous membranes rich in blood vessels for warming and humidifying air.  
  - Connected to the paranasal sinuses via small openings for drainage and airflow balance.  
  - The dorsal, middle, and ventral meatuses are passageways for airflow through the cavity.  

##Function##
- **Nostrils:**  
  - Serve as the main entry and exit points for air during respiration.  
  - Filter dust, pollen, and debris before air enters the deeper tract.  
  - Dilate to maximize airflow during intense activity or heat.  

- **Nasal Cavities:**  
  - Warm, moisten, and filter inhaled air to protect the lungs.  
  - Provide olfactory reception via sensory cells in the upper regions.  
  - Regulate airflow and pressure distribution through the respiratory tract.  
  - Assist in vocal resonance and thermoregulation during breathing.

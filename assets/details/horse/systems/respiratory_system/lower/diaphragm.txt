#Diaphragm#

The horse’s diaphragm is a powerful dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities.  
It is the primary driver of breathing, creating pressure changes that draw air into the lungs.  
Energetically, it represents strength, flow, and the bridge between grounding and uplift.

###Parts###

##Muscular Dome##  
Contracts and flattens during inhalation.  
Energetically, it symbolizes expansion and empowerment.

##Central Tendon##  
The strong fibrous center supporting coordinated motion.  
Energetically, it reflects stability and inner structure.

##Crura##  
Two strong bands attaching the diaphragm to the spine.  
Energetically, they represent grounding and deep support.

###Function###  
The diaphragm drives inhalation and supports breathing rhythm.  
It also assists posture, core stability, and internal pressure regulation.  
Energetically, it connects grounding with breath, supporting flow and emotional balance.

###Common Imbalances###  
Spasm: restricted breathing or discomfort.  
Weakness: reduced airflow capacity.  
Tension: shallow breathing.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from held emotion or restricted flow.

#Alveoli#

The horse’s alveoli are microscopic air sacs deep within the lungs where gas exchange takes place.  
They allow oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be released.  
Energetically, they represent exchange, renewal, and openness to life force.

###Parts###

##Alveolar Sacs##  
Clusters of tiny air chambers.  
Energetically, they symbolize receptivity and gentle expansion.

##Alveolar Walls##  
Thin membranes where oxygen and carbon dioxide move across.  
Energetically, they reflect sensitivity and permeability.

##Capillary Network##  
A web of blood vessels surrounding each alveolus.  
Energetically, it represents connection and integration.

###Function###  
The alveoli enable vital gas exchange, supporting oxygenation of the body and removal of waste gases.  
Energetically, they sustain renewal, vitality, and flow of life force.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: reduced gas exchange.  
Fluid buildup: restricted breathing.  
Damage: compromised oxygenation.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from exhaustion, overwhelm, or difficulty receiving.

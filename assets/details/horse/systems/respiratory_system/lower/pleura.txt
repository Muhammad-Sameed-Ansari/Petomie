#Pleura#

The pleura consists of two smooth membranes that protect and support the lungs within the chest cavity.  
They provide lubrication and allow effortless expansion during breathing.  
Energetically, they represent protection, softness, and the space needed for free movement.

###Parts###

##Visceral Pleura##  
Covers the outer surface of the lungs.  
Energetically, it symbolizes closeness and direct support.

##Parietal Pleura##  
Lines the chest cavity and diaphragm.  
Energetically, it reflects boundaries and structured space.

##Pleural Cavity##  
A thin, fluid-filled space that reduces friction.  
Energetically, it represents flow, ease, and gentle movement.

###Function###  
The pleura protect the lungs, allow smooth lung movement, and maintain pressure for normal breathing.  
Energetically, they support comfort, ease, and emotional spaciousness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation (pleuritis): pain or restricted breathing.  
Fluid buildup: compression of the lungs.  
Irritation: friction or discomfort.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from tension, pressure, or emotional constriction.

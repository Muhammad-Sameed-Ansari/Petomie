#Bronchi#

The horse’s bronchi are two main airways that branch from the trachea into the left and right lungs.  
They direct air deeper into the respiratory system.  
Energetically, they represent balance, flow, and duality within harmony.

###Parts###

##Primary Bronchi##  
Two main branches delivering air to each lung.  
Energetically, they symbolize balance and choice.

##Secondary and Tertiary Bronchi##  
Smaller divisions that distribute air throughout lung lobes.  
Energetically, they reflect cooperation and flow in complexity.

##Cartilage and Smooth Muscle##  
Provide structure and regulate airflow.  
Energetically, they embody strength and adaptability.

###Function###  
The bronchi transport air between the trachea and bronchioles.  
They also filter particles and maintain even airflow to each lung.  
Energetically, they connect balance and communication, supporting harmony between left and right energy channels.

###Common Imbalances###  
Bronchitis: infection or irritation.  
Mucus buildup: poor airflow or stagnation.  
Wheezing: restricted flow or tension.  
Energetically, imbalance may indicate resistance to balance or emotional constriction.

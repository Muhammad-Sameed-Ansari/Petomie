#Bronchioles#

The horse’s bronchioles are small airways branching from the bronchi to deliver air to the alveoli.  
They regulate airflow and play a vital role in oxygen exchange.  
Energetically, they represent fine tuning, adaptability, and the gentle rhythm of breath.

###Parts###

##Terminal Bronchioles##  
The final conducting airways before gas exchange begins.  
Energetically, they symbolize precision and readiness.

##Respiratory Bronchioles##  
Contain alveoli where gas exchange starts.  
Energetically, they represent transformation and surrender.

##Smooth Muscle##  
Controls constriction and dilation for airflow regulation.  
Energetically, it reflects flexibility and control over emotional flow.

###Function###  
Bronchioles distribute air evenly and regulate resistance in the lungs.  
They ensure that oxygen reaches all regions of the respiratory system.  
Energetically, they maintain internal rhythm and balance, supporting emotional adaptability and peace.

###Common Imbalances###  
Constricted airways: tension or anxiety.  
Inflammation: allergic or stress reaction.  
Shortness of breath: disrupted rhythm or energetic tightness.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect suppressed emotion or difficulty adapting.

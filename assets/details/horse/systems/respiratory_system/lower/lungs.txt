#Lungs#

The horse’s lungs are large, spongy organs that fill most of the chest cavity.  
They are responsible for oxygenating blood and removing carbon dioxide.  
Energetically, they embody renewal, release, and connection between the physical and emotional body.

###Parts###

##Lobes##  
The lungs are divided into lobes that expand and contract during breathing.  
Energetically, they represent expansion and the ability to receive.

##Alveoli##  
Tiny air sacs where gas exchange occurs with the blood.  
Energetically, they symbolize transformation and renewal with every breath.

##Pleura##  
A thin membrane surrounding each lung, reducing friction during movement.  
Energetically, it reflects protection and harmony in motion.

##Pulmonary Vessels##  
Carry oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and oxygen-rich blood back to the heart.  
Energetically, they embody flow, nourishment, and life circulation.

###Function###  
The lungs exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, sustaining every cell in the body.  
They maintain acid-base balance and support energy production.  
Energetically, they purify and renew, helping release grief and draw in calm vitality.

###Common Imbalances###  
Coughing: irritation or emotional release.  
Congestion: stagnation or unresolved emotion.  
Labored breathing: tension or blocked flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from holding grief, fear, or resistance to change.

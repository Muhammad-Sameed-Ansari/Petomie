#Trachea#

The horse’s trachea, or windpipe, is a flexible tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi.  
It allows air to move freely to and from the lungs during breathing.  
Energetically, it represents connection and communication between spirit, breath, and body.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Rings##  
C-shaped structures that support the trachea and prevent collapse during breathing.  
Energetically, they symbolize stability, protection, and openness.

##Tracheal Muscle##  
Smooth muscle along the dorsal side that adjusts airway diameter.  
Energetically, it represents adaptability and rhythm.

##Mucous Membrane##  
Lines the inner surface, trapping dust and pathogens with cilia.  
Energetically, it reflects cleansing, purification, and healthy flow.

###Function###  
The trachea conducts air between the upper and lower respiratory systems.  
It filters, warms, and moistens air entering the lungs.  
Energetically, it supports flow and communication, harmonizing breath with life energy.

###Common Imbalances###  
Coughing: irritation, infection, or tension.  
Restricted breathing: tracheal compression or energetic blockage.  
Inflammation: dust exposure or emotional stress.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked expression or difficulty releasing emotion.

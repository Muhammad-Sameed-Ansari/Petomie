#Trachea#

##Location##
Extends from the larynx to the bronchi, running along the ventral midline of the neck and into the thoracic cavity. In the horse, it lies just below the esophagus at the neck’s beginning, then passes dorsally to the heart where it divides into the right and left primary bronchi at the thoracic inlet.

##Shape##
A flexible, cylindrical tube composed of cartilaginous rings and connective tissue:
- **Cartilaginous Rings:** 50–60 C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings that maintain airway patency and prevent collapse during breathing.
- **Trachealis Muscle:** Smooth muscle connecting the open ends of the cartilage dorsally, allowing slight diameter adjustments.
- **Mucosa:** Lined with ciliated pseudostratified epithelium containing goblet cells that produce mucus for particle trapping.
- **Submucosa:** Rich in glands and elastic fibers for support and flexibility.
- **Bifurcation (Carina):** Point where the trachea divides into the two main bronchi leading to each lung.

##Function##
Conducts air between the upper airways and the lungs
Filters, warms, and humidifies inhaled air
Protects lower respiratory passages by trapping debris in mucus and moving it upward via ciliary action
Maintains open airway during inspiration and expiration through cartilaginous support
Adjusts airflow resistance during respiration via the trachealis muscle

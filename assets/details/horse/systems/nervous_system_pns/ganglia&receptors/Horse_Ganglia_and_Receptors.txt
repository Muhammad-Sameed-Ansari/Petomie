#Ganglia & Receptors#

##Location##
- **Ganglia:** Found throughout the peripheral nervous system, located along the spinal cord and near or within target organs.  
  - **Dorsal Root Ganglia:** Along the spinal nerves, containing sensory neuron cell bodies.  
  - **Autonomic Ganglia:** Located in the sympathetic chain, prevertebral areas, or within organ walls (as in the parasympathetic system).  
- **Receptors:** Distributed across skin, muscles, joints, and internal organs.  
  - Present in sensory organs such as the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue, as well as throughout tissues detecting touch, pain, and position.

##Shape##
- **Ganglia:** Oval or nodular structures composed of clusters of neuronal cell bodies surrounded by supportive glial cells and connective tissue capsules.  
- **Receptors:** Specialized nerve endings or modified epithelial cells that detect environmental or internal stimuli.  
  - **Mechanoreceptors:** Respond to touch, pressure, and stretch.  
  - **Thermoreceptors:** Detect changes in temperature.  
  - **Nociceptors:** Sense pain or tissue damage.  
  - **Chemoreceptors:** Detect chemical stimuli such as taste, smell, and blood composition.  
  - **Photoreceptors:** Respond to light within the retina.  
  - **Proprioceptors:** Located in muscles, tendons, and joints; provide body position awareness.

##Function##
- **Ganglia:** Serve as relay stations and processing centers for nerve impulses outside the central nervous system.  
  - Dorsal root ganglia transmit sensory information to the spinal cord.  
  - Autonomic ganglia coordinate involuntary activities such as heart rate, digestion, and glandular function.  
- **Receptors:** Convert physical or chemical stimuli into electrical nerve impulses (sensory transduction).  
  - Enable the horse to perceive and respond to touch, pain, temperature, movement, and environmental changes.  
Together, ganglia and receptors form the foundation of sensory perception and neural communication within the peripheral nervous system.

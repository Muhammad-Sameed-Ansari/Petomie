#Peripheral Nerves#

##Location##
Extend from the brain and spinal cord to all regions of the body, forming the communication network of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
Include cranial nerves emerging from the brain and spinal nerves branching from the spinal cord.
Found throughout the head, neck, trunk, and limbs, connecting the central nervous system with muscles, skin, and internal organs.

##Shape##
Long, thread-like bundles composed of thousands of nerve fibers (axons) bound together by connective tissue sheaths.
- **Epineurium:** Outer protective layer enclosing the entire nerve.
- **Perineurium:** Surrounds bundles (fascicles) of nerve fibers.
- **Endoneurium:** Encloses individual axons and their myelin sheaths.
- **Sensory Fibers:** Carry information from receptors to the central nervous system.
- **Motor Fibers:** Transmit impulses from the central nervous system to muscles and glands.
- **Mixed Nerves:** Contain both sensory and motor fibers, serving most body regions.

##Function##
Provide two-way communication between the central nervous system and the body.
- **Sensory Function:** Detect and relay information about touch, temperature, pain, and body position to the brain.
- **Motor Function:** Carry commands to skeletal muscles for voluntary movement and to smooth muscles and glands for involuntary control.
- **Reflex Activity:** Mediate quick, automatic responses without brain involvement.
- **Coordination:** Ensure precise interaction between sensory input and motor output, supporting posture, movement, and awareness of the environment.

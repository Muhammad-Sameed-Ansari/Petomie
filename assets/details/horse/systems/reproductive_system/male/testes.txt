#Testes#

##Location##
Located within the **scrotum**, which lies between the hind limbs and behind the penis.  
Each testis is suspended by the **spermatic cord**, containing blood vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and the vas deferens.

###Shape###
**Oval and slightly flattened organs** with a smooth surface.  
Each is enclosed in a dense fibrous capsule called the **tunica albuginea** and covered by a visceral layer of the **vaginal tunic**.

##Parts##

###1. Seminiferous Tubules###
Highly coiled tubes where **sperm production (spermatogenesis)** occurs.

###2. Interstitial Cells (Leydig Cells)###
Located between the seminiferous tubules and responsible for **testosterone secretion**.

###3. Tunica Albuginea###
A strong connective tissue capsule providing support and protection for the internal testicular tissue.

###4. Mediastinum Testis###
A connective tissue core through which ducts, blood vessels, and lymphatics pass.

###Function###
Produce **spermatozoa** and **male sex hormones** (primarily testosterone).  
Maintain an optimal temperature for sperm production through the **scrotum’s thermoregulation system**.  
Support the development of secondary sexual characteristics and libido.

#Sperm Duct (Vas Deferens)#

##Location##
Extends from the **tail of the epididymis** through the **spermatic cord** into the pelvic cavity.  
Joins the ducts of the accessory glands before entering the **urethra** near the bladder neck.

###Shape###
A **narrow, muscular tube** with a small lumen and a slightly coiled path.  
The wall is thick and lined with smooth muscle.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal Segment###
Begins at the epididymis and carries sperm into the pelvic region.

###2. Ampulla###
A **dilated terminal portion** serving as a temporary reservoir for sperm.

###3. Terminal Segment###
Merges with ducts from the accessory glands to form the **ejaculatory duct**, opening into the urethra.

###Function###
Transports **mature sperm** from the epididymis to the urethra during ejaculation.  
Serves as a **temporary storage chamber**.  
Contracts rhythmically during ejaculation to propel sperm forward.

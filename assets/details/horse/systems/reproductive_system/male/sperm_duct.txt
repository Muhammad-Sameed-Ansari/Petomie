#Sperm Duct#

The sperm duct, or vas deferens, carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra during ejaculation.  
It serves as the final transport pathway for reproductive cells.  
Energetically, it represents **direction, focus, and purpose**, guiding creation into manifestation.

###Parts###

##Ampulla##  
Enlarged section for temporary sperm storage.  
Energetically, it symbolizes readiness and anticipation.

##Duct Wall##  
Smooth muscle that propels sperm forward.  
Energetically, it represents determination and guided strength.

##Connection to Urethra##  
Joins with ducts from accessory glands.  
Energetically, it reflects unity and cooperation.

###Function###  
The sperm duct transports sperm during ejaculation, ensuring coordinated reproductive flow.  
Energetically, it channels **intention into purposeful movement**, directing life force toward creation.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blockage: stagnation or tension.  
Inflammation: infection or energetic congestion.  
Weak propulsion: low energy or poor muscle tone.  
Energetic blockage: loss of direction or creative clarity.

#Epididymis#

##Location##
Lies along the **dorsal border** of each testis within the scrotum.  
Connects the **efferent ducts** of the testis to the **sperm duct (vas deferens)**.

###Shape###
A **long, coiled structure** that appears as a curved ridge along the testis.  
It consists of three distinct regions: the **head**, **body**, and **tail**.

##Parts##

###1. Head (Caput)###
Receives immature sperm from the testis through multiple efferent ducts.

###2. Body (Corpus)###
The central portion where sperm mature and gain motility.

###3. Tail (Cauda)###
Acts as a **storage site** for mature sperm before ejaculation and connects to the sperm duct.

###Function###
Provides an environment for **sperm maturation and storage**.  
Transports sperm from the testis to the sperm duct during ejaculation.  
Absorbs testicular fluid and secretes substances that aid sperm survival.

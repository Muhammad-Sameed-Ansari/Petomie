#Mammary Glands#

In stallions, the mammary glands are small, nonfunctional structures located between the forelimbs.  
Though inactive, they mirror the shared design of nurturing across all mammals.  
Energetically, they represent **balance, compassion, and the potential to nurture**, even within masculine strength.

###Parts###

##Teats##  
Small undeveloped structures on the abdomen.  
Energetically, they symbolize balance between giving and receiving.

##Glandular Tissue##  
Rudimentary and nonfunctional in males.  
Energetically, it reflects latent nurturing energy.

##Surrounding Fascia##  
Supports the small glands within the skin.  
Energetically, it represents gentleness and stability.

###Function###  
The mammary glands have no functional role in the male but reflect anatomical balance.  
Energetically, they signify **harmony and compassion**, integrating caring qualities within strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: irritation or hormonal imbalance.  
Sensitivity: skin inflammation or emotional tenderness.  
Energetic imbalance: inner conflict between giving and restraint.

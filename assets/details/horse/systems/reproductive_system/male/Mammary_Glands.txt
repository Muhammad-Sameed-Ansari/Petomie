#Mammary Glands (Stallion)#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral surface** of the abdomen between the forelimbs and groin area, similar in position to the mare’s glands.  
Stallions typically have **two small, undeveloped mammary glands** with small, nonfunctional teats.

###Shape###
Flat, smooth structures beneath the skin, covered by fine hair.  
Each has a small nipple (teat) but lacks glandular development.

##Parts##

###1. Mammary Glands###
Rudimentary and composed mainly of connective and fatty tissue.

###2. Nipples (Teats)###
Two small, nonfunctional teats located near the sheath area.

###3. Duct System###
Minimal or absent; no active glandular secretion.

###Function###
No reproductive or lactational function.  
Remain hormonally inactive under normal testosterone levels.  
Occasionally respond to hormonal imbalance with slight enlargement.  
Serve as homologous structures to the mare’s mammary glands, reflecting shared embryonic origins.

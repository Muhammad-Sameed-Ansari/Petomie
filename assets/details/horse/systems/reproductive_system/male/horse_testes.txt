#Testes#

###Location###
The testes are found inside the scrotum, a soft pouch of skin that hangs between the horse’s hind legs, just behind the penis.
They are placed horizontally, which helps keep them at the right temperature for making sperm.

###Shape###
They are smooth, oval-shaped organs, about the size of a large egg (8–12 cm long).
Each is covered by a thin, protective membrane.

###Parts###
- **Outer Cover (Tunica):** Protective layer around the testis.
- **Seminiferous Tubules:** Tiny tubes inside where sperm cells are made.
- **Rete Testis:** Channels that collect sperm.
- **Blood Vessels and Tissue:** Support the organ and carry nutrients.

###Function###
- Produce sperm (male reproductive cells).
- Make testosterone, the male hormone that influences behavior and body changes.
- Work best at a slightly cooler temperature than the body, which is why they hang outside in the scrotum.

#Ovaries#

###Location###
Located near the 5th lumbar vertebra, just below the kidneys in the dorsal abdominal cavity.
Each ovary is suspended by a portion of the broad ligament known as the mesovarium.

###Shape###
The mare’s ovaries are large, oval, and about 7–8 cm long. They have a distinctive bean-like indentation, called the ovulation fossa, where eggs are released.
The surface is smooth, unlike in most other species.

###Parts###
- **Cortex:** Outer functional zone containing developing follicles and corpora lutea.
- **Medulla:** Central region with connective tissue and blood vessels.
- **Ovulation Fossa:** Only site where ovulation occurs in mares.
- **Follicles:** Fluid-filled structures housing developing ova.

###Function###
- Produce and release ova (eggs) during the estrous cycle.
- Secrete estrogen and progesterone, regulating heat and pregnancy cycles.
- Form the corpus luteum after ovulation to sustain early pregnancy.
- Control uterine tone and reproductive behavior through hormonal balance.

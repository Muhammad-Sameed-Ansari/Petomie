#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

##Location##
Extend from the **ovaries** to the **uterine horns** within the mare’s abdominal cavity.  
Each tube lies within the **broad ligament**, curving gently toward the ovary and forming the connection between the ovary and uterus.

###Shape###
**Narrow, coiled tubes** lined with delicate folds and cilia.  
Each tube consists of three regions: the **infundibulum**, **ampulla**, and **isthmus**.

##Parts##

###1. Infundibulum###
The **funnel-shaped opening** near the ovary that captures the released egg (ovum).  
It is lined with fimbriae—tiny finger-like projections that guide the egg into the oviduct.

###2. Ampulla###
The **wider middle section** where **fertilization** typically occurs.  
It has ciliated cells and secretions that nourish sperm and egg.

###3. Isthmus###
The **narrow lower portion** connecting the ampulla to the uterus.  
It transports the fertilized egg to the uterine horn using gentle muscular contractions.

###Function###
Captures the **ovulated egg** from the ovary.  
Provides the **site for fertilization** between egg and sperm.  
Secretes fluids that **nourish and support** sperm and early embryos.  
Moves the **fertilized egg** toward the uterus through **cilia and muscle activity**.  
Ensures proper timing of **embryo entry** into the uterus for implantation.

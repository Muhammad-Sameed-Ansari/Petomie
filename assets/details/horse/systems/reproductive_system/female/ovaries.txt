#Ovaries#

##Location##
Located in the **abdominal cavity** near the **kidneys**, one on each side of the mare’s body.  
They are attached to the **broad ligament** of the uterus and connected to the **oviducts** (fallopian tubes).

###Shape###
**Oval to bean-shaped structures**, smooth and firm in texture.  
In mares, ovulation occurs at a specialized area called the **ovulation fossa**.

##Parts##

###1. Follicles###
Fluid-filled sacs within the ovary where **ova (eggs)** develop.  
Their size and number change throughout the estrous cycle.

###2. Corpus Luteum###
A **temporary endocrine structure** that forms after ovulation and secretes **progesterone** to maintain pregnancy.

###3. Ovulation Fossa###
A **depression** unique to mares where ovulation occurs, allowing the release of the mature egg.

###4. Ovarian Stroma###
The supportive connective tissue framework containing blood vessels and developing follicles.

###Function###
Produce and release **ova (eggs)** for fertilization.  
Secrete **hormones** such as estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the **estrous cycle** and prepare the uterus for pregnancy.  
Coordinate with the **pituitary gland** and **hypothalamus** to regulate reproductive timing and fertility.  
Influenced by **daylight length (photoperiod)**, with activity increasing in spring and summer and decreasing in winter.

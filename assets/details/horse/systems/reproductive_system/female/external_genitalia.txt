#External Genitalia#

##Location##
Located beneath the **anus** at the rear of the mare’s body, forming the **visible part** of the reproductive tract.  
These structures surround the opening to the vagina and vestibule, protecting the inner reproductive organs.

###Shape###
Composed of **soft folds of skin and muscle**, the external genitalia vary slightly in appearance depending on the mare’s **estrous cycle** and hormonal condition.  
They form a vertical slit with lips that meet tightly to maintain closure and cleanliness.

##Parts##

###1. Vulva###
The outermost portion of the reproductive tract consisting of two vertical **labia** that close tightly to protect against infection and contamination.

###2. Clitoris###
A small, **sensitive organ** located at the lower part of the vulva within the **clitoral fossa**.  
It plays a role in sensory stimulation during mating and can become more prominent during estrus.

###3. Vestibule###
The **shared passage** for the reproductive and urinary tracts, extending from the hymen to the vulva.  
It contains mucous glands that help maintain moisture and protection.

###4. Dorsal and Ventral Commissures###
The **upper and lower junctions** where the vulvar lips meet, maintaining proper closure and alignment.

###5. Perineum###
The **area of skin and muscle** between the vulva and the anus that supports the pelvic floor and helps prevent contamination of the vagina.

###Function###
Forms a **protective barrier** for the internal reproductive organs.  
Provides the **opening for urination** and **passage for mating and foaling**.  
Allows for **visual and sensory cues** during the estrous cycle.  
Maintains a **tight seal** to preserve a clean and healthy reproductive environment.

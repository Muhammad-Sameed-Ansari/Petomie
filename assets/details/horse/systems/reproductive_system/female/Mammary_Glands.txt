#Mammary Glands (Mare)#

##Location##
Located in the inguinal region between the hind legs, just in front of the udder area.  
Mares typically have **two mammary glands**, each associated with one teat.  
The glands are positioned closely together and are supported by connective tissue and skin folds.

###Shape###
Compact, rounded glands surrounded by connective tissue and fat.  
Each gland contains secretory alveoli that produce milk and ducts that converge toward the teats.

##Parts##

###1. Left and Right Mammary Glands###
Paired glands positioned in the groin area.

###2. Teats###
Two short, cylindrical projections, each with two duct openings for milk flow.

###3. Glandular Tissue###
Composed of alveoli that produce milk during lactation, regulated by hormones such as **prolactin** and **oxytocin**.

###4. Duct System###
Network of milk ducts converging toward the teat openings.

###5. Supporting Structures###
Connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatics that support the udder and maintain circulation.

##Function##
Produces and secretes milk to nourish the foal after birth.  
Provides antibodies (colostrum) that support the newborn’s immune system.  
Responds to hormonal cycles and stimulation from suckling.  
Supports maternal bonding and nurturing behaviors during lactation.

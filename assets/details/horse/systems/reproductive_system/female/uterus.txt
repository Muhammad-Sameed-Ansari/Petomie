#Uterus#

##Location##
Situated within the **pelvic cavity** and extending slightly into the **abdominal cavity**.  
It lies between the **urinary bladder** (below) and the **rectum** (above).  
The uterus connects to the **uterine tubes (oviducts)** at its horns and continues caudally to the **cervix**.

###Shape###
A **Y-shaped, hollow, muscular organ** consisting of two long **uterine horns** and a short **uterine body**.  
The walls are thick and elastic, designed to expand during pregnancy and contract during foaling.

##Parts##

###1. Uterine Horns (Cornua Uteri)###
Two long, curved extensions reaching toward the ovaries where the embryo first attaches and early development begins.

###2. Uterine Body (Corpus Uteri)###
The central region where the two horns join; connects directly to the cervix and serves as the main cavity during pregnancy.

###3. Endometrium###
The **inner mucosal lining** that secretes nutrients and supports embryo implantation.  
It undergoes cyclic changes under hormonal influence.

###4. Myometrium###
The **thick muscular middle layer** responsible for powerful contractions during parturition to expel the foal.

###5. Perimetrium###
The **outermost serous membrane** providing protection and structural support to the uterus.

###Function###
Provides the **site for embryo implantation** and **fetal development**.  
Nourishes the embryo through **endometrial secretions** before placental attachment.  
Expands throughout gestation to accommodate the growing foal.  
Contracts during **parturition (foaling)** to deliver the foal.  
Returns to normal size after birth through **uterine involution**.  
Responds to hormonal signals from the ovaries to regulate the **estrous cycle**.

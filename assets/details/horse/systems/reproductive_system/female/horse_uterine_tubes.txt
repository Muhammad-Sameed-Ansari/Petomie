#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

###Location###
Each uterine tube connects the ovary to the uterus, extending within the broad ligament.
They are located high in the abdominal cavity near the ovaries.

###Shape###
Slender, coiled tubes approximately 20–30 cm long. Their inner walls are lined with cilia to move the egg gently toward the uterus.

###Parts###
- **Infundibulum:** Funnel-shaped opening near the ovary that captures the released egg.
- **Ampulla:** Wider section where fertilization typically occurs.
- **Isthmus:** Narrow part connecting to the uterine horn.

###Function###
- Transport ova from the ovary to the uterus.
- Provide the site and environment for fertilization.
- Move sperm toward the ovum via muscular and ciliary activity.
- Support early embryonic development before implantation.

#Vagina#

##Location##
Located between the **cervix** and the **vulva**, forming the **final section** of the mare’s reproductive tract.  
It lies within the **pelvic cavity**, extending from the cervix to the external genitalia.

###Shape###
A **muscular, elastic tube** approximately 15–20 centimeters long, lined with mucous membrane and longitudinal folds.  
It allows flexibility during mating and foaling and changes slightly based on hormonal state.

##Parts##

###1. Cranial Vagina (Fornix Vaginae)###
The area closest to the **cervix**, forming a small recess that partially surrounds it.

###2. Middle Vagina###
The central region that allows **sperm passage** and **urine drainage**.

###3. Vestibule###
The **caudal portion**, shared with the urinary tract, extending from the **hymen** (or remnant fold) to the **vulva**.

###4. Hymen or Vestibular Fold###
A thin mucosal fold marking the transition between the vagina and vestibule, more evident in young mares.

###5. External Opening (Vulva)###
The final opening to the outside, forming the **entrance of the reproductive tract**.

###Function###
Acts as the **copulatory organ** during breeding.  
Provides a **passageway for foaling** during parturition.  
Allows **drainage of uterine and cervical secretions**.  
Protects against infection through **mucous secretions** and natural bacterial balance.  
Maintains flexibility and strength to accommodate both mating and birth.

#Cervix#

The cervix is the muscular passage between the uterus and the vagina.  
It acts as a protective barrier, opening during breeding and foaling, and remaining closed during pregnancy.  
Energetically, it represents **boundaries, transition, and trust**, balancing protection with openness.

###Parts###

##Cervical Canal##  
The inner tunnel that connects the uterus and vagina.  
Energetically, it symbolizes flow and communication between creation and expression.

##Cervical Folds##  
Muscular ridges that allow expansion and closure.  
Energetically, they represent flexibility and adaptability during transformation.

##Cervical Mucus##  
Fluid that changes texture through the cycle to protect or guide sperm.  
Energetically, it reflects intuition and the rhythm of receptivity.

###Function###  
The cervix protects the uterus from infection, supports pregnancy, and opens to allow passage of new life.  
Energetically, it maintains **healthy boundaries and trust in timing**, guiding transitions between creation and release.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: infection or irritation from imbalance.  
Tightness or spasm: emotional tension or guardedness.  
Weak closure: hormonal or energetic depletion.  
Energetic blockage: fear of vulnerability or change.

#Cervix#

##Location##
Located at the **junction between the uterus and the vagina**, forming the gateway that separates the **uterine body** from the **vaginal canal**.  
It lies within the pelvic cavity and serves as a barrier and passageway in the reproductive tract.

###Shape###
A **fibromuscular tube** approximately 5 to 7 centimeters long, with thick circular folds that form a tight seal.  
The cervix changes tone and texture during the mare’s estrous cycle—**firm and closed** when not in heat or pregnant, and **soft and relaxed** during estrus or foaling.

##Parts##

###1. External Os###
The **outer opening** of the cervix facing the vagina, which opens slightly during estrus to allow sperm entry.

###2. Cervical Canal###
The **central passageway** lined with folds of mucous membrane that produce secretions aiding or blocking sperm transport.

###3. Internal Os###
The **inner opening** connecting to the uterus, remaining tightly closed during pregnancy to protect the developing foal.

###4. Cervical Folds###
Thick circular ridges of tissue that help form the seal between the uterus and vagina, ensuring a sterile environment within the uterus.

###Function###
Acts as a **protective barrier** and **regulatory passageway** within the reproductive system.  
Prevents contamination of the uterus when closed.  
Opens during **estrus** to allow sperm passage into the uterus.  
Expands during **parturition (foaling)** to permit delivery of the foal.  
Produces **mucus** that changes consistency with hormonal cycles to either facilitate or block sperm movement.

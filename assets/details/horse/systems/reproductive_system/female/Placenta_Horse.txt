#Placenta#

##Location##
The placenta forms only during **pregnancy** within the mare’s **uterus**.  
It develops from the union of the **uterine lining** and the **fetal membranes**, connecting the developing foal to the mare through the **umbilical cord**.

###Shape###
A **thin, vascular membrane** that lines the uterus during pregnancy.  
It consists of two main layers: the **chorion** (outer layer) attached to the uterus, and the **allantois** (inner layer) that connects to the fetus.

##Function##
The placenta is a **temporary organ** active only during pregnancy.  
- Facilitates **exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste** between mare and foal.  
- Produces important **hormones** such as progesterone, estrogen, and relaxin to maintain pregnancy.  
- Supports **fetal development** and protects against some infections.  
- Ends its function once the foal is born and the placenta is expelled.

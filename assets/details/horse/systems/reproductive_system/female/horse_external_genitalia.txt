#External Genitalia#

###Location###
Located at the caudal end of the reproductive tract, beneath the anus in the perineal region.
It forms the outermost visible portion of the mare’s reproductive system and connects internally to the vestibule and vagina.

###Shape###
Composed of two vertical folds of skin known as the labia, enclosing the vestibule.
The overall shape is elongated and slit-like, ensuring a protective seal against external contaminants.
The clitoris lies at the lower (ventral) end, housed within a small fossa.

###Parts###
- **Labia (Vulvar Lips):** Two skin folds forming the external boundary; meet at the dorsal and ventral commissures.
- **Vulvar Cleft:** The external slit between the labia, leading into the vestibule.
- **Clitoris:** A small, sensitive organ located at the ventral commissure, important for sexual stimulation and estrus signaling.
- **Clitoral Fossa:** A small pocket housing the clitoris, sometimes containing the clitoral sinuses.
- **Perineum:** The skin and underlying tissue between the anus and vulva.

###Function###
- Acts as the first barrier against infection, dirt, and debris entering the reproductive tract.
- The labia form a tight seal to prevent air and bacteria from entering the vagina.
- The clitoris plays a role in sexual arousal and behavioral signs of estrus.
- During heat, the mare may “wink” the clitoris as part of reproductive display behavior.
- Helps maintain a clean passageway to support healthy reproduction and foaling.

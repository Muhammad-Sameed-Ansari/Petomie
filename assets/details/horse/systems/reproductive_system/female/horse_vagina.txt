#Vagina#

###Location###
The vagina lies within the pelvic cavity, extending from the cervix to the vestibule.
It is positioned between the rectum (above) and the bladder and urethra (below).

###Shape###
A muscular, elastic tube approximately 15–20 cm long, lined with moist mucous membrane.
It is capable of stretching during mating and foaling while maintaining a protective inner surface.

###Parts###
- **Cranial Vagina:** The section nearest to the cervix; smooth and glandular, aiding lubrication.
- **Caudal Vagina:** The lower portion leading toward the vestibule, lined with stronger stratified epithelium for protection.
- **Hymen Area (Vestibulovaginal Junction):** A thin fold marking the transition to the vestibule.
- **Fornix Vagina:** A shallow recess around the cervix where semen may collect during breeding.

###Function###
- Acts as the copulatory organ, receiving the stallion’s penis during mating.
- Serves as part of the birth canal during foaling.
- Protects internal organs from infection through its natural mucous secretions and acidic environment.
- Provides elasticity and lubrication to facilitate safe passage of the foal and semen transport.
- Plays a key role in reproductive communication through chemical and tactile signals during estrus.

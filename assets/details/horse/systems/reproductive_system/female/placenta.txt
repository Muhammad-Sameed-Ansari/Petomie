#Placenta#

##Location##
Forms only during **pregnancy**, within the **uterus**, surrounding and nourishing each developing fetus.  
It develops along the entire length of the **uterine horns and body**.

###Shape###
A **diffuse, epitheliochorial placenta**, meaning that **microscopic villi** (microcotyledons) cover nearly the entire chorionic surface.  
These villi interdigitate with the endometrium for nutrient and gas exchange.  
Includes the **chorion, allantois, and amnion** membranes.

##Parts##

###1. Chorion###
The **outer fetal membrane** that forms the interface with the maternal endometrium.  
Contains **microcotyledons** that anchor the placenta to the uterine lining.

###2. Allantois###
A **vascular membrane** that fuses with the chorion to create the **chorioallantoic membrane**, facilitating gas and waste exchange.

###3. Amnion###
The **inner membrane** surrounding the fetus, filled with amniotic fluid for cushioning and protection.

###4. Umbilical Cord###
Connects the fetus to the placenta; contains **two umbilical arteries, one umbilical vein,** and the **urachus** (waste drainage).

###5. Endometrium (Maternal Side)###
Forms shallow **crypts** where the chorionic villi attach; contributes to nutrient absorption and secretion.

###Function###
Enables **gas, nutrient, and waste exchange** between mare and fetus.  
Maintains the **pregnancy** through hormone production (e.g., progesterone precursors).  
Provides **protection, cushioning, and immune barrier** for the developing foal.  
Is expelled as the **afterbirth** shortly after parturition.

#Lymph Nodes#

##Parts##

###Structure###
Lymph nodes are small, oval or bean-shaped structures found throughout the horse’s body, especially around the throatlatch, shoulder, elbow, groin, and stifle regions.
Each node has an outer capsule made of connective tissue and an inner framework filled with lymphocytes and macrophages.
Energetically, they represent **guardianship and purification**, ensuring that only what supports balance flows onward.

###Afferent Lymphatic Vessels###
These are the incoming vessels that deliver unfiltered lymph fluid to the lymph node.
They carry lymph loaded with waste, pathogens, and immune cells from tissues.
Energetically, they symbolize **reception and awareness**, bringing information to be processed and cleared.

###Cortex###
The outer layer of the lymph node containing clusters of B lymphocytes in follicles.
This is where immune responses are initiated as B cells detect and react to antigens.
Energetically, the cortex represents **activation and vigilance**, preparing the body to defend and respond appropriately.

###Medulla###
The inner region containing macrophages and plasma cells that filter and clean the lymph.
Here, pathogens and toxins are neutralized before lymph leaves the node.
Energetically, the medulla reflects **cleansing and integration**, where what was once harmful is transformed into restored equilibrium.

###Efferent Lymphatic Vessels###
The single outgoing vessel that carries filtered lymph away from the node toward the heart.
Energetically, this flow represents **release and renewal**, sending purified energy and fluid back into circulation.

###Regional Groups###
Major lymph node clusters include:
- **Parotid and mandibular nodes:** near the head and jaw, filtering lymph from the mouth and face.
- **Prescapular and axillary nodes:** near the shoulder, filtering the forelimbs and chest.
- **Inguinal and popliteal nodes:** near the hind limbs, filtering lymph from the legs and lower body.
Energetically, these regional nodes represent **localized awareness and protection**, each guarding a specific territory of the horse’s body and energy field.

##Function##
Lymph nodes act as **filtering and monitoring centers** within the lymphatic system.
They cleanse lymph fluid of bacteria, toxins, and debris while activating lymphocytes to defend against infection.
They also serve as communication points, ensuring harmony between different immune regions.

Energetically, lymph nodes correspond to **boundaries and discernment** — knowing what to keep and what to release.
Healthy lymph nodes maintain both physical and emotional purity, promoting clarity and grounded vitality.
When under stress, stagnation can manifest as swelling, fatigue, or emotional heaviness, signaling a need for renewal and rest.

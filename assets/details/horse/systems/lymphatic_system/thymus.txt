#Thymus#

##Parts##

###Thymic Lobules###
Soft, pale sections of glandular tissue located in the front of the chest near the heart and trachea.
Each lobule has an outer cortex and an inner medulla that guide the growth and education of immune cells.
Energetically, these lobules represent **nurturing and transformation**, where immature energy develops into strength and clarity.

###Cortex###
The outer layer of the thymus where immature lymphocytes (T-cells) multiply and begin learning to recognize the body’s own tissues.
This process builds discernment and prevents the immune system from attacking itself.
Energetically, the cortex embodies **learning and purification**, allowing the horse to respond to challenges with wisdom and balance.

###Medulla###
The inner region where mature T-cells are tested and refined before being released into circulation.
Only the strongest and most balanced cells are allowed to enter the lymphatic network.
Energetically, the medulla represents **integration and mastery**, turning potential into protective strength.

###Thymic Hormones###
Hormones like thymosin, thymulin, and thymopoietin control T-cell development and ensure communication between lymphatic organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes.
Energetically, they symbolize **coordination and communication**, uniting physical immunity with energetic harmony.

###Lymphatic Connections###
The thymus is deeply connected to the lymphatic system through vessels and nodes.
It sends mature T-cells into circulation, allowing them to coordinate immune defense throughout the body.
Energetically, this connection represents **unity and flow**, illustrating how the immune network acts as one body of protection.

##Function##
The thymus serves as the **training center** of the lymphatic and immune systems.
It transforms immature lymphocytes into self-aware defenders that circulate through the lymph network.
By teaching immune cells to distinguish between “self” and “non-self,” it maintains internal balance and prevents overreaction.

In foals and young horses, the thymus is large and very active, building strong immune foundations.
As the horse matures, it shrinks but continues to influence both physical and energetic immunity.

Energetically, the thymus reflects **heart-centered strength** — merging protection with compassion.
A balanced thymus supports vitality, openness, and resilience.
When imbalanced, the horse may show signs of lowered immunity, fatigue, or emotional tension.

#Lymphatic Vessels#

##Parts##

###Lymphatic Capillaries###
Microscopic, thin-walled vessels located throughout the horse’s body, especially in connective tissues.
They collect interstitial fluid that leaks from blood capillaries and begin the transport of lymph.
Energetically, they represent **receptivity and sensitivity**, gathering subtle changes from the body and guiding them toward balance.

###Larger Lymphatic Vessels###
As lymph flows forward, capillaries merge into larger vessels with valves that prevent backflow.
These vessels run alongside veins and arteries, forming a vast network that directs lymph toward the heart.
Energetically, they symbolize **pathways of release**, allowing emotions and toxins to move out of the system gently and continuously.

###Lymphatic Valves###
One-way valves located throughout the vessels that keep lymph moving in a single direction.
They open and close based on pressure changes caused by body movement, breathing, and muscle contractions.
Energetically, these valves embody **trust and rhythm**, showing how natural motion and flow maintain harmony without force.

###Lymphatic Ducts###
The largest lymphatic vessels — including the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct — collect lymph from the entire body and return it to the bloodstream near the heart.
Energetically, they represent **integration and unity**, merging what has been purified back into circulation and wholeness.

###Supporting Structures###
Smooth muscle and connective tissue within vessel walls help regulate flow and provide flexibility.
These structures prevent collapse during movement and ensure a steady, responsive flow.
Energetically, they connect to **stability and resilience**, maintaining structure within fluidity.

##Function##
Lymphatic vessels transport lymph fluid from tissues back into the bloodstream, maintaining fluid balance and aiding immune defense.
They carry immune cells and nutrients, filter toxins through lymph nodes, and prevent tissue swelling (edema).

Energetically, the lymphatic vessels mirror the body’s **emotional and energetic circulation** — a network of flow that clears stagnation and restores vitality.
Healthy lymph flow reflects emotional ease, adaptability, and lightness, while blocked pathways can lead to heaviness, stiffness, or tension.

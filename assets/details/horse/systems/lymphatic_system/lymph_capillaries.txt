#Lymph Capillaries#
Part of the Lymphatic System: Microscopic vessels that collect excess fluid from tissues.  
In horses, they initiate lymph flow throughout the body, especially in the limbs.  
Energetically, they represent sensitivity, awareness, and receptivity.

###Parts###

##Structure##  
Tiny vessels with thin walls allowing easy fluid entry.  
Energetically, symbolize openness and responsiveness.

##Distribution##  
Present throughout connective tissues, particularly near muscles and skin.  
Energetically, reflect subtle awareness of surroundings.

###Function###  
Absorb interstitial fluid and begin lymph transport.  
Energetically, connect the inner and outer flow of energy.

###Common Imbalances###  
Obstruction: tension or lack of flexibility.  
Leakage: depletion or over-extension.  
Energetic stagnation: emotional hypersensitivity.

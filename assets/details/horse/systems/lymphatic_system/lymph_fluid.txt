#Lymph Fluid#

##Parts##

###Lymph Fluid###
A clear, watery liquid that flows through the tissues of the horse’s body, collecting waste products, proteins, and immune cells.
It originates from blood plasma that leaks out of capillaries into the tissues and is then absorbed into the lymphatic vessels.
Lymph fluid travels through a network of vessels and nodes, eventually returning to the bloodstream near the heart.
Energetically, it represents **cleansing, renewal, and emotional flow**, helping the horse release stagnation and maintain energetic balance.

###Composition###
Contains white blood cells (especially lymphocytes), water, proteins, fats, and waste materials.
Its components constantly shift based on the horse’s hydration, diet, and immune activity.
Energetically, this balance symbolizes **adaptation and responsiveness** — a mirror of how the horse adjusts to its environment.

###Flow Path###
Lymph fluid moves through small lymph capillaries into larger vessels, passing through lymph nodes for filtration before returning to the bloodstream.
Movement depends on muscle activity, breathing, and natural body motion, as the lymphatic system lacks a central pump like the heart.
Energetically, this gentle rhythm reflects **natural movement and freedom**, showing how consistent flow maintains harmony in both body and mind.

##Function##
Lymph fluid supports detoxification, immune defense, and fluid balance.
It collects toxins and waste from tissues, filters them through lymph nodes, and returns purified fluid to circulation.
By transporting immune cells throughout the body, it helps recognize and eliminate pathogens.
Energetically, lymph fluid is the **river of renewal**, carrying away what no longer serves the body and making room for lightness and vitality.
A well-flowing lymph system keeps the horse feeling supple, clear, and emotionally grounded, while stagnation can lead to swelling, tension, or emotional heaviness.

#Spleen (Horse)#

##Parts##

###Splenic Capsule###
A thin but strong outer covering of the spleen made of connective tissue and smooth muscle fibers.
It allows the spleen to contract and expand, releasing or storing blood as needed.
Energetically, the capsule represents **adaptability and protection**, helping the horse maintain stability under pressure.

###Red Pulp###
Composed of blood-filled sinuses and cords that filter and recycle red blood cells.
Old or damaged cells are broken down here, and useful components like iron are conserved.
Energetically, the red pulp symbolizes **renewal and transformation**, clearing out the old to make room for the new.

###White Pulp###
Contains clusters of lymphocytes (immune cells) surrounding small arteries.
It detects pathogens and produces an immune response when needed.
Energetically, the white pulp represents **awareness and defense**, maintaining balance between vulnerability and strength.

###Splenic Artery and Vein###
The splenic artery supplies oxygenated blood to the spleen, while the splenic vein carries filtered blood away to the portal circulation.
Together, they maintain a constant flow of nutrients and waste exchange.
Energetically, they represent **circulation and connection**, integrating the spleen’s cleansing role with the body’s overall vitality.

###Splenic Ligaments###
Fibrous tissues that attach the spleen to the stomach and diaphragm.
They stabilize its position in the abdomen while allowing gentle movement during breathing and digestion.
Energetically, these ligaments symbolize **support and grounding**, anchoring the spleen while allowing flexibility.

##Function##
The spleen acts as a major blood filter and immune organ.
It removes old or damaged red blood cells, stores fresh blood for sudden needs (like exercise or stress), and helps mount immune responses.
By regulating blood quality and immune balance, it supports endurance and recovery.

Energetically, the spleen governs **stability, nourishment, and emotional balance**.
It transforms food and experience into usable energy, grounding the horse’s physical and emotional body.
When balanced, the spleen promotes calm strength and steady focus.
Imbalance may appear as fatigue, worry, poor digestion, or weakened immunity.

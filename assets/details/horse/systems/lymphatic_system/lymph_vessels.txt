#Lymph Vessels#
Part of the Lymphatic System: Channels that carry lymph from tissues to lymph nodes and ducts.  
In horses, they are vital for limb drainage and immune communication.  
Energetically, they represent pathways of flow and transition.

###Parts###

##Walls and Valves##  
Thin tubes with one-way valves preventing backflow.  
Energetically, symbolize trust in direction and timing.

##Network##  
Connect lymph capillaries to regional lymph nodes.  
Energetically, reflect cooperation and communication.

###Function###  
Carry lymph fluid toward lymph nodes for filtration.  
Maintain circulation and assist immune balance.  
Energetically, sustain fluid harmony within motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: blocked energy or physical tension.  
Poor drainage: stagnation or fatigue.  
Energetic blockage: emotional heaviness or delay in progress.

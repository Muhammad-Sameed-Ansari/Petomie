#Tonsils (Horse)#

##Parts##

###Tonsillar Tissue###
Soft lymphatic tissue located at the back of the throat, within the pharyngeal region.
Horses have several small tonsillar clusters rather than one large structure, positioned near the entrance to the respiratory and digestive tracts.
They are found on the walls of the pharynx, around the base of the tongue, and near the soft palate.
This tissue is part of the immune system’s first line of defense.

###Tonsillar Crypts###
Small folds and openings on the surface of the tonsils that increase surface area for immune surveillance.
They trap particles, bacteria, and antigens that enter through the mouth or nose, exposing them to immune cells for recognition and elimination.

###Lymphocytes###
White blood cells (mainly B and T cells) concentrated in the tonsils.
They detect and react to pathogens, initiating the body’s local immune response.
Energetically, lymphocytes symbolize **awareness and protection**, maintaining harmony between the inner and outer environment.

###Associated Lymphatic Vessels###
Tiny lymphatic channels that connect the tonsils to nearby lymph nodes and the larger lymphatic system.
They help carry immune cells and filtered fluid, ensuring communication with the rest of the immune network.

##Function##
The tonsils serve as an early warning and defense system for the horse’s body.
They monitor everything the horse breathes or swallows, recognizing harmful microorganisms before they spread.
By triggering immune responses, they protect the respiratory and digestive systems from infection.

Energetically, the tonsils represent **communication, expression, and boundary protection**.
They filter what enters — both physically and energetically — helping the horse stay open yet safe.
When balanced, they support clear communication and a healthy immune gateway.
When under stress, imbalance may appear as throat irritation, lowered immunity, or difficulty “voicing” emotion or energy.

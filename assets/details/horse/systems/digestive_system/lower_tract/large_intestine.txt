#Large Intestine#

The horse’s large intestine includes the cecum, colon, and rectum.  
It absorbs water, ferments fiber, and stores fecal material before elimination.  
Energetically, it represents processing life experiences and releasing what is no longer needed.

###Parts###

A large fermentation chamber that breaks down fibrous plant material.  
Energetically, it symbolizes patience and transformation.

##Rectum##

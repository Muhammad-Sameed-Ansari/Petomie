#Anus#

The horse’s anus forms the terminal opening of the digestive tract, allowing elimination of waste material.  
It is located just beneath the tail and surrounded by strong circular muscles.  
Energetically, it represents release, letting go, and the clearing of what no longer serves.

###Parts###

##Anal Canal##  
The short passage that connects the rectum to the outside of the body.  
Energetically, it symbolizes transition and completion.

##Sphincter Muscles##  
Circular muscles that control the opening and closing of the anus.  
Energetically, they represent control, boundaries, and trust in release.

##Surrounding Skin and Nerves##  
Sensitive tissue that responds to touch and signals reflexes for defecation.  
Energetically, it connects awareness with the process of letting go.

###Function###  
The anus regulates the final stage of digestion, controlling the elimination of feces.  
It ensures waste leaves the body efficiently and hygienically.  
Energetically, it supports cleansing, grounding, and renewal by releasing stagnant energy.

###Common Imbalances###  
Constipation: resistance to release or tightness in control.  
Irritation or Swelling: inflammation or emotional tension.

Energetically, imbalances may indicate difficulty in letting go or unresolved emotional buildup.

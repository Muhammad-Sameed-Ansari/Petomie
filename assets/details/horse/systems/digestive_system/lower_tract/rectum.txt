#Rectum#

The horse’s rectum is the final part of the large intestine, storing feces before elimination.  
It plays a key role in the completion of digestion and waste removal.  
Energetically, it represents readiness for closure, completion, and letting go.

###Parts###

##Rectal Wall##  
Muscular tissue that pushes feces toward the anus.  
Energetically, it supports flow and movement toward release.

##Mucous Membrane##  
Protective lining that eases passage and prevents friction.  
Energetically, it represents protection and smooth transitions.

##Rectal Sphincter##  
Controls retention and release before defecation.  
Energetically, it symbolizes control, trust, and timing.

###Function###  
The rectum stores waste material until defecation.  
It coordinates with muscles and nerves for smooth elimination.  
Energetically, it allows resolution of cycles and prepares for renewal.

###Common Imbalances###  
Straining: tension or resistance in release.  
Retention: fear of letting go or lack of movement.  
Irritation: inflammation or energetic friction.  
Energetically, imbalances may indicate fear of endings or difficulty completing emotional processes.

#Liver#

The horse’s liver is a large, vital organ located in the front right side of the abdomen.  
It filters blood, processes nutrients, and produces bile for fat digestion.  
Energetically, it symbolizes vitality, detoxification, and emotional balance.

###Parts###

##Lobes##  
The liver is divided into left, right, quadrate, and caudate lobes.  
Energetically, they represent balance and coordination of multiple functions.

##Hepatic Cells##  
Cells that detoxify blood and store glycogen.  
Energetically, they reflect purification and energy storage.

##Bile Ducts##  
Channels that carry bile to the duodenum for digestion.  
Energetically, they support flow and transformation.

###Function###  
The liver filters toxins, metabolizes nutrients, and maintains energy supply.  
It produces bile, stores vitamins, and supports immunity.  
Energetically, it clears emotional toxins, maintains inner strength, and supports life force flow.

###Common Imbalances###

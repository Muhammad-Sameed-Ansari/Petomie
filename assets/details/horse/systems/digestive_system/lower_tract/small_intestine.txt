#Small Intestine#

The horse’s small intestine is a long, coiled tube where most nutrient absorption occurs.  
It lies between the stomach and large intestine.  
Energetically, it represents assimilation of life experiences and emotional nourishment.

###Parts###

##Duodenum##  
First section where bile and pancreatic enzymes enter for digestion.  
Energetically, it symbolizes initiation and transformation.

##Jejunum##  
Middle portion where most absorption of nutrients takes place.  
Energetically, it relates to growth and integration.

##Ileum##  
Final section that connects to the large intestine.  
Energetically, it represents completion and readiness for transition.

###Function###  
The small intestine digests food and absorbs nutrients, electrolytes, and water.  
It works with the liver and pancreas for balanced metabolism.  
Energetically, it governs discernment—deciding what to keep and what to release, both physically and emotionally.

###Common Imbalances###  
Colic or discomfort: disrupted flow or emotional stress.  
Malabsorption: difficulty integrating experiences or receiving nourishment.  
Gas: overactivity or energetic tension.  
Energetically, imbalances may reflect inner conflict or blocked assimilation of emotions.

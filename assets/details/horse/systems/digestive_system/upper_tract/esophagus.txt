#Esophagus#

The horse’s esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat (pharynx) to the stomach.  
It transports food and water through coordinated muscular movements.  
Energetically, it represents flow, transition, and trust in life’s direction.

###Parts###

##Upper Esophageal Sphincter##  
Controls entry from the pharynx to the esophagus.  
Energetically, it symbolizes opening to nourishment and communication.

##Esophageal Body##  
A long muscular tube moving food toward the stomach by peristalsis.  
Energetically, it reflects persistence and smooth flow through life’s processes.

##Lower Esophageal Sphincter##  
Prevents backflow of stomach contents.  
Energetically, it represents boundaries and self-protection.

###Function###  
The esophagus carries swallowed material to the stomach safely and efficiently.  
It relies on muscular waves and coordination.  
Energetically, it symbolizes allowing life to move forward with trust and alignment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Choking: blockage or resistance to flow.  
Reflux: weak closure or reversed energy direction.  
Irritation: inflammation from tension or stress.  
Energetically, imbalances may arise from blocked communication or resistance to progress.

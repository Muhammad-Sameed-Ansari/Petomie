#Salivary Glands#

The horse’s salivary glands produce saliva to moisten food and aid digestion.  
They also lubricate the mouth and help maintain oral health.  
Energetically, they symbolize flow, preparation, and sweetness in life.

###Parts###

##Parotid Glands##  
Located near the jaw, produce watery saliva.  
Energetically, they represent clarity and purification.

##Submandibular Glands##  
Situated beneath the jaw, secrete mixed saliva.  
Energetically, they symbolize balance and readiness.

##Sublingual Glands##  
Under the tongue, secrete mucus-rich saliva.  
Energetically, they reflect emotional softness and nurturing.

###Function###

Saliva contains enzymes that begin breaking down carbohydrates.  
Energetically, saliva represents preparation and flow, connecting nourishment with emotional ease.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dry Mouth: dehydration or suppressed flow.  
Excess Saliva: stress or overactivity.

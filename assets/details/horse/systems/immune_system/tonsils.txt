#Tonsils#

##Location##
Located in the horse’s pharynx, particularly within the soft palate, root of the tongue, and walls of the throat. 
They form an essential immune ring guarding the entrance to the respiratory and digestive tracts.

###Shape###
Soft, diffuse patches of lymphoid tissue rather than well‑defined lumps. 
They appear as slightly raised, pink, textured areas within the mucosa.

###Parts###

##Pharyngeal Tonsils##
Positioned in the roof of the pharynx. 
Energetically represent awareness, vigilance, and protective sensing.

##Palatine Tonsils##
Located along the sides of the throat within the soft tissues. 
Energetically symbolize boundaries, filtering, and choosing what enters.

##Lingual Tonsils##
Found at the base of the tongue. 
Energetically reflect communication, expression, and intuitive filtering.

###Function###
Tonsils act as the first line of immune defense, sampling inhaled or ingested material and activating lymphocytes. 
They help recognize pathogens early and signal the immune system to respond. 
Energetically they support intuition, discernment, and protective clarity at the body’s entry points.

###Common Imbalances###
Tonsillitis, throat inflammation, chronic respiratory infections, difficulty swallowing, reduced local immunity.

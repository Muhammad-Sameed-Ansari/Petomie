#Lymph Nodes#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the body along the lymphatic vessels.
Prominent clusters are found under the jaw and throat (mandibular, parotid,
retropharyngeal), in front of the shoulder (prescapular), in the armpit
(axillary), in the groin (inguinal), around the udder or sheath
(supramammary), and deep in the chest and abdomen
(mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes).

###Shape###
Small, bean-shaped or oval structures with a soft to firm texture and a
grey-pink interior.

###Parts###

##Capsule and Trabeculae##
Outer connective tissue covering and internal supporting strands that give
structure and form channels.
Energetically represent boundaries, container, and structural support.

##Cortex##
Outer region rich in lymphoid follicles and B-lymphocytes.
Energetically symbolizes awareness, first response, and protective focus.

##Paracortex##
Middle region dominated by T-lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells.
Energetically represents evaluation, discernment, and wise decision-making.

##Medulla##
Inner core with medullary cords and sinuses containing plasma cells and
filtered lymph.
Energetically reflects integration, cleansing, and deep inner processing.

###Function###
Lymph nodes filter lymph, trap pathogens, present antigens, and activate
lymphocytes.
They help drain tissues, reduce swelling, and coordinate local and systemic
immune responses.
Energetically they maintain clear communication, protection, and flow
throughout the body.

###Common Imbalances###
Swollen or painful lymph nodes, lymphadenitis, lymphoma, chronic infection,
lymphatic congestion, fluid retention.

#Bile Storage and Flow#
Part of the Hepatobiliary System: In horses, bile is secreted continuously as they lack a gallbladder.  
Energetically, this represents ongoing purification, trust in flow, and balance through constancy.

###Parts###

##Continuous Secretion##  
Bile flows directly from the liver into the duodenum.  
Energetically, symbolizes steady rhythm and surrender to natural cycles.

##Duct Pathways##  
Bile travels through hepatic and common bile ducts.  
Energetically, reflects fluid movement and adaptation.

###Function###  
Supports fat digestion and detoxification without storage pauses.  
Maintains equilibrium in digestion through constant bile flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Sluggish flow: tension or poor digestion.  
Energetic stagnation: resistance to change.  
Overactivity: restlessness or inner agitation.

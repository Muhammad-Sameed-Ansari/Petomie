#Bile Canaliculi#
Part of the Hepatobiliary System: Tiny channels between hepatocytes that collect bile before it enters ducts.  
Energetically, they represent subtle awareness, communication, and the inner pathways of flow.

###Parts###

##Intercellular Channels##  
Connect liver cells for bile movement.  
Energetically, symbolize inner flow and connection.

###Function###  
Gather bile produced by hepatocytes and guide it into intrahepatic ducts.  
Support the liver’s detox and fat metabolism processes.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blockage: stagnation or emotional pressure.  
Inflammation: inner irritation or imbalance.  
Energetic restriction: blocked communication.  
Energetic depletion: dullness or fatigue.

##Roots (C6–T2)##

#Location#  
Originate from the ventral branches of the sixth cervical (C6) through second thoracic (T2) spinal nerves.  
Emerge from the intervertebral foramina of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae and course laterally into the axillary region, forming the basis of the brachial plexus.

#Shape#  
Series of large, paired spinal nerve roots that merge and intertwine to form a compact neural network before dividing into trunks.  
Each root carries both motor fibers (from spinal cord to limb muscles) and sensory fibers (from limb back to spinal cord).

#Parts#  
- C6 Root: Contributes to the suprascapular and subscapular nerves.  
- C7 Root: Joins C6 and C8 in forming the cranial and middle trunks.  
- C8 Root: Major contributor to middle and caudal trunks.  
- T1 Root: Forms part of the caudal trunk, continues into median and ulnar nerves.  
- T2 Root: Minor contributor; often connects to intercostobrachial nerve supplying axillary skin.

#Function#  
Transmit sensory and motor impulses between the spinal cord and forelimb.  
Serve as the foundational connection for all subsequent branches of the brachial plexus, enabling coordinated limb movement and sensation.

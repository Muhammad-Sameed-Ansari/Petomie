##Trunks & Cords##

#Location#  
Situated deep in the shoulder region, between the ventral neck muscles and the first ribs.  
Formed by the ventral branches of spinal nerves C6–T2, which unite to create the brachial plexus before dividing into major peripheral nerves supplying the forelimb.

#Shape#  
Network of thick, branching nerve bundles organized into Trunks (upper, middle, lower) and Cords (lateral, medial, posterior), enclosing the axillary artery.

#Parts#  
Trunks:  
- Cranial (Upper) Trunk – Formed by roots of C6 and C7.  
- Middle Trunk – Continuation of C8.  
- Caudal (Lower) Trunk – Formed by T1 and T2.  

Cords:  
- Lateral Cord – Continuation of cranial and middle trunks; gives rise to musculocutaneous and part of median nerve.  
- Medial Cord – From caudal trunk; gives rise to ulnar and part of median nerve.  
- Posterior Cord – Formed from all trunks; gives rise to axillary, radial, and thoracodorsal nerves.

#Function#  
Serve as conduits for motor and sensory fibers distributing signals from the spinal cord to the forelimb.  
Coordinate limb movement, reflexes, and sensory input by organizing nerve flow within the brachial plexus.

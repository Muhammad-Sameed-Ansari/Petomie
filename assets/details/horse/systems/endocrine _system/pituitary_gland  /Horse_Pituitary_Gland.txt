#Pituitary Gland#

##Location##
Lies at the base of the brain, housed within a small depression of the sphenoid bone called the **sella turcica**.  
Connected to the hypothalamus by a slender stalk known as the **infundibulum**, which allows communication between the nervous and endocrine systems.

##Shape##
Small, oval, reddish-gray gland divided into two major parts:  
- **Anterior Pituitary (Adenohypophysis):** Glandular portion producing multiple hormones that regulate other endocrine glands.  
- **Posterior Pituitary (Neurohypophysis):** Neural portion storing and releasing hormones produced by the hypothalamus.  
Encased in a fibrous capsule and highly vascularized to facilitate hormone distribution.

##Function##
Acts as the **master endocrine gland**, controlling hormone release throughout the body.  
- **Anterior Pituitary Hormones:**  
  - **Growth Hormone (GH):** Stimulates tissue growth and metabolism.  
  - **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH):** Activates thyroid hormone production.  
  - **Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH):** Stimulates adrenal cortex secretion.  
  - **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH):** Promotes follicle development in females and sperm production in males.  
  - **Luteinizing Hormone (LH):** Triggers ovulation and testosterone release.  
  - **Prolactin (PRL):** Initiates milk production.  
- **Posterior Pituitary Hormones:**  
  - **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** Regulates water balance by acting on kidneys.  
  - **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions and milk letdown.  
- **Overall Role:** Integrates neural and endocrine functions to maintain growth, reproduction, metabolism, and fluid balance.

#Thymus#

##Parts##
###Cortex###
Outer layer where immature **T-cells** (immune cells) are formed.  

###Medulla###
Inner zone where mature T-cells are released into circulation.  

###Thymic Hormones###
Produce **thymosin**, which trains T-cells to recognize and fight infections.  

##Function##
Essential for **immune development** in young horses.  
Supports disease resistance by teaching immune cells to distinguish healthy tissue from invaders.  
As horses age, the thymus shrinks, but its influence remains vital for long-term immune strength.

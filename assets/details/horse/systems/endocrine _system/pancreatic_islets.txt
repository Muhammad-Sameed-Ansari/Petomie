#Pancreatic Islets (Islets of Langerhans)#

##Parts##
###Alpha Cells###
Produce **glucagon**, which raises blood sugar by releasing stored glucose.  

###Beta Cells###
Produce **insulin**, which lowers blood sugar by allowing glucose to enter cells.  

###Delta Cells###
Produce **somatostatin**, which balances the activity of insulin and glucagon.  

##Function##
Maintains **stable blood glucose levels** to supply energy to cells, muscles, and the brain.  
Prevents sugar imbalance, fatigue, and metabolic disorders.  
Proper function supports endurance, focus, and performance during work.

#Hypothalamus#

##Location##
Located at the **base of the horse’s brain**, just below the **thalamus** and directly above the **pituitary gland**.  
It serves as the key link between the **nervous system** and the **endocrine system**, integrating body functions with emotional and environmental cues.

###Shape###
A **small, almond-shaped** cluster of nerve nuclei forming part of the **diencephalon**.  
It lies around the third ventricle and connects closely with the pituitary gland through a network of blood vessels and nerve fibers.

##Function##
Acts as the **master regulator** of the horse’s internal environment.  
- Controls **hormone release** via the pituitary gland.  
- Maintains **body temperature**, **hydration**, **hunger**, and **sleep cycles**.  
- Regulates **metabolism**, **stress response**, and **reproductive behavior**.  
- Balances the **autonomic nervous system**, managing functions like heart rate, digestion, and breathing.  
- Coordinates emotional and physical responses to the environment, helping the horse adapt to change.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Third Eye and Crown Chakras – clarity, awareness, and connection to higher guidance.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Governing Vessel and Bladder Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Symbolizes inner regulation and calm leadership. Imbalance may appear as stress sensitivity, hormone imbalance, or confusion.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Centered awareness, emotional balance, and strong instinctual trust.  
- **Energetic Support:** Quiet time, rhythmic movement, balanced feeding, and calm energy work support hypothalamic harmony.

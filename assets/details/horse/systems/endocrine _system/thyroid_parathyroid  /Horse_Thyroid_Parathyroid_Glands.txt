#Thyroid & Parathyroid Glands#

##Location##
Situated in the neck region on either side of the trachea, just below the larynx.  
The thyroid gland consists of two lobes connected by a narrow isthmus.  
The parathyroid glands are small, oval nodules embedded within or attached to the posterior surface of the thyroid lobes.

##Shape##
- **Thyroid Gland:** Smooth, reddish-brown, lobulated structure with a thin connective tissue capsule. Each lobe is elongated and gently curved around the trachea.  
  - **Follicles:** Spherical units filled with colloid, storing the hormone precursors thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).  
- **Parathyroid Glands:** Small, pale, ovoid nodules (usually two pairs) situated close to or within the thyroid tissue.  

##Function##
- **Thyroid Gland:**  
  - Produces **thyroxine (T4)** and **triiodothyronine (T3)**, regulating metabolism, growth, and energy production.  
  - Influences heart rate, temperature, and oxygen consumption.  
- **Parathyroid Glands:**  
  - Secrete **parathyroid hormone (PTH)** which regulates blood calcium and phosphate levels.  
  - Works with calcitonin (from the thyroid) to maintain calcium balance in bones and blood.  
- **Overall Role:** Together, they stabilize metabolic rate, calcium homeostasis, and neuromuscular function essential for overall health and growth.

#Parathyroid Glands#

##Parts##
###Chief Cells###
Secrete **parathyroid hormone (PTH)**, which raises calcium levels by mobilizing calcium from bones.  

###Oxyphil Cells###
Less active cells that may store hormone reserves.  

###Blood Capillaries###
Allow rapid hormone transport to the bloodstream.  

##Function##
Regulates **calcium and phosphorus balance** for strong bones, normal nerve signals, and healthy muscle contractions.  
Works with the thyroid’s calcitonin to maintain stable calcium levels for movement, hoof strength, and performance.

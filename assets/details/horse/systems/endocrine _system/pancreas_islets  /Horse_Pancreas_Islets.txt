#Pancreas (Islets)#

##Location##
Situated in the cranial part of the abdominal cavity, nestled within the mesoduodenum between the duodenum and the right lobe of the liver.  
The islets of Langerhans are microscopic clusters scattered throughout the exocrine pancreas tissue.

##Shape##
The pancreas is a pale, lobulated gland with both exocrine and endocrine portions.  
- **Islets of Langerhans:** Small, round or oval clusters of pale cells dispersed within darker acinar tissue.  
- **Cell Types:** 
  - **Alpha Cells:** Secrete glucagon to raise blood glucose.  
  - **Beta Cells:** Secrete insulin to lower blood glucose.  
  - **Delta Cells:** Produce somatostatin, regulating both insulin and glucagon.  
  - **F Cells:** Secrete pancreatic polypeptide aiding digestive regulation.  

##Function##
Regulates blood glucose and energy metabolism through hormone secretion.  
- **Insulin:** Promotes glucose uptake and storage as glycogen.  
- **Glucagon:** Stimulates glucose release from the liver.  
- **Somatostatin:** Balances secretion of other pancreatic hormones.  
- **Pancreatic Polypeptide:** Modulates digestive enzyme secretion and intestinal motility.  
Works in harmony with the liver, adrenal glands, and digestive system to maintain metabolic balance and homeostasis.

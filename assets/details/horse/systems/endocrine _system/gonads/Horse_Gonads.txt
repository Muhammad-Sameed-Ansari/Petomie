#Gonads#

##Location##
The gonads are the primary reproductive organs—the testes in males and ovaries in females.
- **In Males:** The testes are located within the scrotum, suspended outside the abdominal cavity to maintain an optimal temperature for sperm production.
- **In Females:** The ovaries lie in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity, just behind the kidneys, attached by the mesovarium within the broad ligament of the uterus.

##Shape##
Paired organs with distinct structures suited to their reproductive functions.
- **Testes:** Oval, smooth, and firm, surrounded by a fibrous capsule (tunica albuginea). Internally divided into lobules containing seminiferous tubules.
- **Ovaries:** Irregularly oval with a smooth outer surface and an ovulation fossa where follicles rupture to release ova.
- **Associated Ducts:**
  - In males: epididymis and vas deferens.
  - In females: oviducts (fallopian tubes) and uterine horns.

##Function##
Serve as the source of gametes and reproductive hormones essential for fertility and sexual function.
- **Testes:** Produce sperm (spermatogenesis) and secrete testosterone, responsible for male sexual characteristics, libido, and muscle development.
- **Ovaries:** Produce ova (eggs) and secrete estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and development of female characteristics.
Together, the gonads ensure reproduction, hormone balance, and secondary sexual development in the horse.

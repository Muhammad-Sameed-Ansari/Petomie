#Pituitary Gland (Hypophysis)#

##Parts##
###Anterior Lobe (Adenohypophysis)###
Produces hormones that influence growth, metabolism, and reproduction.  
Main secretions include:  
- **Growth Hormone (GH):** Supports growth, muscle repair, and cell renewal.  
- **TSH:** Activates the thyroid gland for metabolism control.  
- **ACTH:** Signals the adrenal glands to release cortisol during stress.  
- **FSH & LH:** Regulate reproductive cycles, ovulation, and sperm production.  
- **Prolactin:** Promotes milk production in lactating mares.  

###Posterior Lobe (Neurohypophysis)###
Stores and releases two hormones made by the hypothalamus:  
- **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions and milk letdown.  
- **ADH:** Regulates water balance through kidney control.  

###Infundibulum###
A connecting stalk linking the pituitary gland to the brain, transmitting nerve and hormonal signals.

##Function##
Serves as the **master gland** that controls most endocrine functions in the horse, regulating growth, metabolism, stress responses, hydration, and reproduction.

#Brainstem#
The brainstem connects the horse’s brain to the spinal cord, managing life-sustaining functions like breathing and heart rhythm.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, rhythm, and the natural pulse of life.

###Parts###

Energetically, stabilizes life energy and presence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: loss of flow or fear response.  
Respiratory imbalance: stress or emotional overload.

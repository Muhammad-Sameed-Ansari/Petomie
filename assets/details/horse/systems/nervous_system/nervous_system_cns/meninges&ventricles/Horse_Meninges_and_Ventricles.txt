#Meninges & Ventricles#

##Location##
The meninges surround the brain and spinal cord, providing protection and support within the cranial and vertebral cavities.  
The ventricles are interconnected cavities located deep within the brain, filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that circulates through the central nervous system.

##Shape##
- **Meninges:** Three connective tissue layers enclosing the brain and spinal cord.  
  - **Dura Mater:** Tough, outer fibrous membrane adhering to the inner surface of the skull and vertebral canal.  
  - **Arachnoid Mater:** Middle, delicate web-like membrane forming the subarachnoid space where CSF flows.  
  - **Pia Mater:** Thin, vascular layer closely attached to the surface of the brain and spinal cord.  
- **Ventricles:** Four connected chambers within the brain.  
  - **Lateral Ventricles (Left & Right):** Located in each cerebral hemisphere.  
  - **Third Ventricle:** Narrow midline cavity within the diencephalon.  
  - **Fourth Ventricle:** Lies between the brainstem and cerebellum; continues as the central canal of the spinal cord.

##Function##
- **Meninges:** Protect the central nervous system from mechanical injury and provide structural stability.  
  - Contain blood vessels that supply the brain and spinal cord.  
  - Form the dural sinuses, which drain venous blood from the brain.  
- **Ventricles:** Produce, circulate, and store cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  
  - **CSF:** Cushions the brain and spinal cord, removes waste products, and helps maintain chemical stability and pressure balance.  
Together, the meninges and ventricles maintain the physical protection, nourishment, and homeostasis of the horse’s central nervous system.

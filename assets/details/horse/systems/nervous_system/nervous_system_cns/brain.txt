#Brain#

##Location##
Situated within the cranial cavity of the skull, the brain is securely enclosed by the cranial bones and protected by the meninges.  
It connects to the spinal cord at the foramen magnum, forming the central hub of the horse’s nervous system.

###Parts###
1. **Cerebrum** – The largest region of the brain, divided into left and right hemispheres.  
   Responsible for voluntary movement, sensory interpretation, memory, learning, and conscious thought.  
   Controls decision-making, coordination of complex actions, and response to stimuli.

2. **Cerebellum** – Located beneath the cerebrum at the back of the brain.  
   Regulates balance, muscle coordination, fine motor control, and spatial awareness.  
   Ensures smooth, precise movement during locomotion and posture adjustment.

3. **Brainstem** – Comprises the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.  
   Acts as the communication link between the brain and spinal cord.  
   Controls essential involuntary functions such as heart rate, breathing, swallowing, and reflexes.

4. **Diencephalon** – Includes the thalamus and hypothalamus.  
   The thalamus processes and relays sensory signals to the cerebrum.  
   The hypothalamus regulates hunger, thirst, temperature, sleep, and endocrine functions through the pituitary gland.

5. **Pituitary Gland** – Attached to the hypothalamus and known as the “master gland.”  
   Releases hormones that control growth, metabolism, and reproductive cycles.

6. **Olfactory Bulbs** – Located at the front of the brain, above the nasal cavity.  
   Receive and process information about scents, vital for environmental recognition and social communication.

##Function##
, Coordinates all voluntary and involuntary bodily functions.  
, Processes sensory input from vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.  
, Regulates balance, posture, and movement precision.  
, Controls vital systems such as respiration, heart rhythm, and digestion.  
, Supports cognitive abilities, learning, memory, and emotional behavior.  
, Integrates sensory data to create awareness of the environment and guide adaptive responses.

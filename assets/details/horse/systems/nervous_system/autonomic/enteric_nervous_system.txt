#Enteric Nervous System#

##Location##
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is located within the **walls of the gastrointestinal tract** — from the **esophagus** to the **rectum**.  
It lies mainly in two layers of nerve networks called **plexuses**:  
- **Myenteric Plexus (Auerbach’s Plexus):** found between the layers of the intestinal muscles, controlling movement.  
- **Submucosal Plexus (Meissner’s Plexus):** located in the inner lining (mucosa), regulating secretions and blood flow.  

###Shape###
A vast network of **millions of small neurons**, forming a web-like pattern that runs the full length of the digestive tract.  
It functions almost like a “mini-brain” inside the gut, with its own reflexes and coordination.

##Function##
- Controls **gut movement (motility)** — rhythmically contracting the muscles to move food through the intestines.  
- Regulates **digestive juices** and **enzyme release** for proper digestion.  
- Manages **blood flow** within the intestinal walls.  
- Communicates with the **sympathetic and parasympathetic systems** but can also work **independently**.  
- Detects **stretch, chemical changes, and pressure** in the gut.  
- Coordinates complex actions such as swallowing, mixing, nutrient absorption, and elimination.  

##Examples##
- When a horse eats hay, the enteric nerves automatically move food through the stomach and intestines using **peristaltic waves**.  
- If the gut becomes distended or inflamed, the ENS detects the problem and can adjust movement or cause discomfort to prevent further harm.  

##Notes##
The ENS is sometimes called the **“second brain”** of the horse because it operates independently of the brain and spinal cord.  
Stress or illness can disrupt its balance, leading to **colic, ulcers, or poor digestion**.  
Supporting gut health through **calm feeding routines, hydration, and high-fiber diets** helps maintain a healthy enteric system.

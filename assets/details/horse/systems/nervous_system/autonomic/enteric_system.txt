#Enteric System#
The enteric nervous system regulates the horse’s digestive tract.  
It functions semi-independently, often called the “gut brain.”  
Energetically, it represents intuition, emotional digestion, and internal harmony.

###Parts###

##Myenteric and Submucosal Plexuses##  
Embedded in intestinal walls to control movement and secretion.  
Energetically, symbolize inner communication and flow.

###Function###  
Manages gut motility, secretion, and interaction with microbes.  
Energetically, processes emotion, instinct, and nourishment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Colic or digestive upset: emotional stress or energetic blockage.  
Tension: held fear or worry.  
Energetic stagnation: blocked intuition or internal disconnection.

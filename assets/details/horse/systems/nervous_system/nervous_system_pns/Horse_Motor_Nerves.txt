#Motor Nerves#

##Location##
Motor nerves extend from the **spinal cord and brainstem** to the **muscles and glands** of the horse’s body.  
They are found in all limbs, the head, neck, and trunk, controlling voluntary and involuntary muscle activity.

###Shape###
Bundles of **long fibers** leaving the spinal cord and branching into smaller nerves that connect to muscle fibers.  
They often run beside arteries and veins within the body.

##Function##
- Carry **commands from the brain** to muscles to produce movement.  
- Control **voluntary muscles** for walking, trotting, running, chewing, and facial motion.  
- Manage **involuntary muscles** in the heart, intestines, and glands.  
- Two main types:  
  - **Somatic Motor Nerves:** voluntary control of skeletal muscles.  
  - **Visceral Motor Nerves:** control smooth muscles and glands automatically.  
- Work together with sensory nerves to maintain coordination and body balance.  

Damage to these nerves can cause stiffness, weakness, or paralysis in the affected area.

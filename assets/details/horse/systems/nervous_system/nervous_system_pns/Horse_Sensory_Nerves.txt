#Sensory Nerves#

##Location##
Sensory nerves are found all over the **body** — in the **skin, muscles, joints, hooves, and internal organs**.  
They connect the body to the spinal cord and brain to provide awareness of touch and movement.

###Shape###
Tiny **nerve endings (receptors)** detect sensations and send information through long fibers to the spinal cord and then the brain.

##Function##
- Detect **touch, pressure, temperature, pain, and body position**.  
- **Proprioceptive nerves** help the horse sense where its limbs are during movement.  
- **Cutaneous nerves** provide feeling in the skin and hair areas.  
- **Visceral sensory nerves** detect changes inside organs like the stomach or intestines.  

These nerves allow the horse to react to touch, maintain balance, avoid injury, and sense the ground while moving.

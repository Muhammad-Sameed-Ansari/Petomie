#Sympathetic Nervous System#

##Location##
The sympathetic system runs mainly along the **thoracic and lumbar regions** of the spinal cord.  
Its nerve fibers exit from **spinal segments T1 to L4** and connect to a long chain of nerve centers called the **sympathetic trunk** on both sides of the spine.  
Branches extend to the **heart, lungs, blood vessels, digestive tract, eyes, and sweat glands**.

###Shape###
A paired chain of **ganglia (nerve clusters)** linked by nerve fibers, resembling a ladder that runs beside the spine.  
From each ganglion, fine branches spread to organs and blood vessels.

##Function##
- Activates the **“fight or flight”** response — preparing the horse’s body for action.  
- Increases **heart rate** and **blood pressure** to deliver more oxygen to muscles.  
- Dilates (widens) **airways** for deeper breathing.  
- **Redirects blood flow** from the digestive tract to the muscles.  
- **Dilates pupils** to improve vision.  
- Stimulates **sweating** to cool the body during exertion.  
- Releases **stored energy** (glucose and fatty acids) for muscle performance.  
- Reduces **gut movement** and **saliva production** during stress or excitement.  

##Examples##
- When startled or galloping, the horse’s heart rate and breathing speed up due to sympathetic activity.  
- It helps maintain alertness, muscle strength, and balance during sudden movement or fear.

##Notes##
Prolonged overactivation (chronic stress) can cause muscle tension, digestive upset, or poor immunity in horses.  
Calm environments and balanced training help normalize sympathetic function.

#Parasympathetic Nervous System#

##Location##
The parasympathetic system originates from the **brainstem** and **sacral spinal cord (S2–S5)**.  
Major parasympathetic nerves include the **Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X)**, which travels down the neck and supplies most internal organs.  
Other branches affect the **eyes, salivary glands, and pelvic organs**.

###Shape###
A network of **long preganglionic fibers** that travel from the brain or sacral cord to small **ganglia near or inside target organs**.  
From there, **short postganglionic fibers** complete the connection to the tissues.

##Function##
- Activates the **“rest and digest”** response — restoring energy and calm after activity.  
- **Slows the heart rate** and lowers blood pressure.  
- Stimulates **saliva and digestive secretions** for chewing and nutrient absorption.  
- Increases **gut movement (peristalsis)** for digestion.  
- **Constricts pupils** to normal size after stress.  
- Promotes **urination and defecation** by relaxing the bladder and intestines.  
- Supports **healing, rest, and body repair** by conserving energy.  
- Works together with the sympathetic system to maintain body balance (homeostasis).

##Examples##
- After exercise, the parasympathetic system slows the heartbeat, restores breathing, and promotes relaxation.  
- During grazing, it enhances saliva flow and gut activity to digest fibrous food efficiently.

##Notes##
Healthy horses naturally shift between sympathetic and parasympathetic states.  
Chronic fear or overwork may suppress parasympathetic recovery, leading to ulcers or tension.  
Gentle handling, regular turnout, and calm feeding times help restore this balance.

#Spinal Nerves#

##Location##
Spinal nerves branch out from the **spinal cord** through openings between the **vertebrae**.  
Each spinal segment gives rise to a pair of nerves — one on each side — forming about **42–44 pairs** (C1–C8, T1–T18, L1–L6, S1–S5, Cd1–Cd5).

###Shape###
Short roots join to form a single mixed nerve, which then divides into dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) branches.  
They run along the spine and branch into smaller nerves that reach the skin, muscles, and organs.

##Function##
- **Transmit messages** between the spinal cord and the body.  
- **Motor fibers:** control movement in muscles.  
- **Sensory fibers:** carry touch, pain, and temperature signals.  
- **Autonomic fibers:** regulate heart rate, digestion, and other automatic functions.  

Main regions:  
- **Cervical Nerves:** control neck and forelimbs (through the brachial plexus).  
- **Thoracic Nerves:** serve chest, ribs, and upper back.  
- **Lumbar Nerves:** connect to abdomen and hind limbs.  
- **Sacral Nerves:** control tail, pelvis, and bladder.  
- **Caudal Nerves:** provide movement and feeling in the tail.

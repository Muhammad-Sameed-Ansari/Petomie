#Brachial Plexus#

##Location##
The brachial plexus lies deep in the **shoulder region (axilla)**, between the lower neck and the upper forelimb.  
It is formed by the **ventral branches of spinal nerves C6 to T2**.

###Shape###
A strong **network of interconnected nerves** that branch into smaller nerves supplying the chest, shoulder, and forelimb.

##Function##
- Controls **movement and sensation** in the horse’s front limbs.  
- Provides both **motor control** and **sensory feedback** for the shoulder, elbow, knee (carpus), and hoof.  
- Main nerves include:  
  - **Suprascapular Nerve:** controls shoulder stability.  
  - **Subscapular Nerve:** rotates the shoulder inward.  
  - **Musculocutaneous Nerve:** flexes the elbow and senses touch on the forearm.  
  - **Radial Nerve:** extends the elbow, knee, and fetlock — vital for weight-bearing.  
  - **Median Nerve:** controls lower forelimb flexors and skin feeling near the fetlock.  
  - **Ulnar Nerve:** helps flex the limb and provides sensation to the back of the leg and fetlock.  
  - **Thoracodorsal Nerve:** moves the shoulder and back muscles.  
  - **Lateral Thoracic Nerve:** activates chest wall and skin twitching muscles.  

##Notes##
Injury to the brachial plexus can cause lameness, weakness, or paralysis of the front limb.  
Mild injuries may heal, but severe ones can permanently affect limb use.

#Gastric Glands#

The horse’s gastric glands are found within the stomach lining, particularly in the glandular portion.  
They secrete acid and enzymes that begin digestion of feed.  
Energetically, they represent transformation, internal strength, and the ability to process experience.

###Parts###

##Cardiac Glands##  
Located near the stomach entrance, producing mucus to protect the lining.  
Energetically, they symbolize acceptance and readiness for nourishment.

##Fundic Glands##  
Located in the main body of the stomach, secreting hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen.  
Energetically, they represent transformation and the fire of digestion.

##Pyloric Glands##  
At the stomach exit, producing mucus and gastrin hormone.  
Energetically, they reflect transition, timing, and emotional closure.

###Function###  
Gastric glands break down feed and prepare it for absorption in the intestines.  
Energetically, they maintain strength, transformation, and resilience.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess acid: stress or emotional irritation.  
Low secretion: fatigue or low digestive fire.  
Inflammation: tension or poor boundaries.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect stress or difficulty assimilating experiences.

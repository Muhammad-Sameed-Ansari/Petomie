#Sebaceous Glands#

The horse’s sebaceous glands are small, oil-producing glands found throughout the skin, closely associated with hair follicles.  
They secrete sebum, a protective oily substance that keeps the coat supple, waterproof, and resilient.  
Energetically, sebaceous glands represent self-protection, boundaries, and ease of expression.

###Parts###

##Sebum-Producing Cells (Sebocytes)##  
Fill with oil and release it into the hair follicle.  
Energetically, they symbolize nourishment, self-care, and healthy boundaries.

##Hair Follicle Duct##  
The channel through which sebum travels to the skin surface.  
Energetically, it represents flow, clarity, and smooth expression of the self.

##Glandular Capsule##  
The delicate connective tissue surrounding and supporting the gland.  
Energetically, it reflects structure, containment, and gentle protection.

###Function###  
Sebaceous glands lubricate the skin and coat, prevent dryness, and create a protective barrier against bacteria and environmental stress.  
They support skin health, shine, and resilience.  
Energetically, they help maintain a sense of inner comfort, self-worth, and personal boundaries.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overproduction: oily coat, clogged follicles, or skin irritation — energetically linked to overwhelm, blurred boundaries, or excess pressure.  
Underproduction: dry, flaky skin or dull coat — energetically tied to withdrawal, depletion, or lack of self-nourishment.

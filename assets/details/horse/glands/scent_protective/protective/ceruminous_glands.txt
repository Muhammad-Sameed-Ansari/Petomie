#Ceruminous Glands#

The horse’s ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands located in the ear canal.  
They produce earwax (cerumen) to trap dust and protect the ear from infection.  
Energetically, they represent listening, intuition, and inner awareness.

###Parts###

##Sebaceous Units##  
Secrete oils to soften earwax.  
Energetically, they symbolize adaptability and comfort.

##Apocrine Cells##  
Produce waxy material for protection.  
Energetically, they represent stability and subtle perception.

##Ear Canal Lining##  
Guides cerumen outward.

###Function###  
Ceruminous glands protect the ear by trapping debris, maintaining moisture, and preventing infection.  
Energetically, they enhance intuition and receptive awareness.

###Common Imbalances###

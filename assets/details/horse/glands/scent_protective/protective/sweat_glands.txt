#Sweat Glands#

The horse’s sweat glands are abundant apocrine glands distributed throughout the skin.  
They regulate body temperature by releasing sweat and also play a minor role in communication.  
Energetically, sweat glands represent **release, relief, and energetic purification**.

###Parts###

##Apocrine Secretory Cells##  
Produce sweat in response to heat or stress.  
Energetically, they symbolize **letting go and cleansing**.

##Sweat Ducts##  
Transport sweat to the skin surface.  
Energetically, they represent **movement, flow, and release of tension**.

##Skin Surface Pores##  
Openings that allow sweat to evaporate.  
Energetically, they reflect **freedom, openness, and energetic clearing**.

###Function###  
Sweat glands cool the body, prevent overheating, and assist in detoxification.  
Energetically, they support **release of stored tension and restoration of balance**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess sweating: stress or heat — energetically linked to **overwhelm or emotional overload**.  
Reduced sweating: inability to cool down — tied to **energetic stagnation or resistance to releasing pressure**.

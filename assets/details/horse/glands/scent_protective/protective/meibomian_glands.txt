#Meibomian Glands#

The horse’s meibomian glands are elongated oil-producing glands located along the inner margins of the eyelids.  
They secrete a thin lipid layer that prevents tear evaporation and protects the eye’s surface.  
Energetically, they represent **clarity, vision, and emotional shielding**.

#Eccrine Glands#

The horse’s eccrine glands are limited to specific regions, such as the frog of the hoof and the muzzle.  
They produce a watery secretion that aids grip and moisture balance.  
Energetically, they represent precision, subtle control, and grounded contact.

###Parts###

##Hoof Frog Glands##  
Secrete moisture to maintain elasticity and traction.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding and stable movement.

##Muzzle Glands##  
Maintain moisture for sensory awareness.  
Energetically, they represent sensitivity and connection.

##Microscopic Ducts##  
Deliver secretions directly onto the skin surface.  
Energetically, they reflect purity and precision.

###Function###  
Eccrine glands aid in localized moisture regulation and tactile function.  
Energetically, they support grounded awareness and adaptability.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dryness: rigidity or detachment.  
Over-moisture: imbalance or confusion.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of contact or instability in perception.

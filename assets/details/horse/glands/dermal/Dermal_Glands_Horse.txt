#Dermal Glands#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the skin of the horse, embedded within the dermis layer. They are especially concentrated in areas such as the muzzle, perineum, neck, and between the hind legs, where thermoregulation and scent marking are most active.

##Shape##
Includes two primary types of glands:
- **Sweat Glands (Eccrine and Apocrine):** Coiled tubular structures that open onto hair follicles or directly onto the skin surface. Apocrine glands dominate in horses and are particularly large and active during exercise or heat.
- **Sebaceous Glands:** Small, sac-like glands connected to hair follicles, secreting oily sebum to lubricate the coat and skin.
- **Tarsal and Circumanal Glands:** Specialized sebaceous glands in localized regions, aiding in protection and scent signaling.

##Function##
Regulates body temperature through sweat production and evaporation
Maintains coat and skin health by secreting protective oils (sebum)
Aids in pheromone and scent communication between horses
Protects the epidermal surface from dehydration and microbial invasion
Supports overall skin flexibility and barrier function

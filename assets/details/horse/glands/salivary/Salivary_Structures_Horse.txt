#Salivary Structures#

##Location##
Located within the head and neck regions, surrounding the oral cavity. The major salivary glands of the horse include the parotid, mandibular, and sublingual glands, with smaller minor glands distributed throughout the lips, cheeks, and tongue.

##Shape##
Composed of lobulated glandular tissue connected to ducts that open into the mouth:
- **Parotid Gland:** The largest, situated below the ear and along the mandible; its duct opens near the upper cheek teeth.
- **Mandibular Gland:** Oval-shaped gland beneath the parotid, with its duct opening near the tongue’s base.
- **Sublingual Gland:** Lies beneath the tongue; smaller and more elongated, secreting directly into the oral cavity.
- **Minor Glands:** Scattered throughout oral mucosa for localized lubrication.

##Function##
Produces and secretes saliva to moisten food and facilitate chewing and swallowing
Begins the digestive process by aiding enzymatic breakdown of carbohydrates
Lubricates the oral cavity to protect mucosal surfaces
Helps maintain oral pH balance and supports overall digestive health
Assists in thermoregulation during heavy work by promoting moisture exchange

#Tracheal Glands#

The horse’s tracheal glands are located within the tracheal wall, producing mucus to trap dust and pathogens.  
They line the airway from the larynx to the bronchi.  
Energetically, they represent communication, rhythm, and freedom of expression.

###Parts###

##Submucosal Glands##  
Produce protective mucus along the trachea.  
Energetically, they symbolize nurturing communication.

##Ducts##  
Open into the tracheal lumen to distribute mucus.  
Energetically, they represent flow and cleansing of words and breath.

##Ciliated Cells##  
Move mucus upward toward the throat for clearance.  
Energetically, they reflect purification and release of old patterns.

###Function###  
Tracheal glands lubricate the airways and protect the lungs from irritants.  
Energetically, they sustain flow and openness in both physical and emotional expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess secretion: irritation or emotional stress.  
Dryness: tension or suppression.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked communication or fear of expression.

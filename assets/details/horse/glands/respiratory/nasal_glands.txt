#Nasal Glands#

The horse’s nasal glands are small mucous and serous glands within the nasal cavity.  
They moisten inhaled air, trap dust, and protect delicate tissues.  
Energetically, they represent purity, intuition, and clarity in breath.

###Parts###

##Mucous Glands##  
Line the nasal passages and produce mucus for trapping particles.  
Energetically, they symbolize cleansing and emotional release.

##Serous Glands##  
Secrete watery fluid that dissolves scent molecules.  
Energetically, they represent perception and awareness.

##Nasal Ducts##  
Deliver secretions onto the nasal surface.  
Energetically, they reflect flow, openness, and inner balance.

###Function###  
Nasal glands humidify, filter, and protect the airways during breathing.  
Energetically, they help clear emotional stagnation and enhance sensitivity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess mucus: irritation or emotional overflow.  
Dryness: stress or restricted flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked intuition or emotional congestion.

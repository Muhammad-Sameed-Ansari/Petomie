#Tarsal Glands#

The horse’s tarsal glands, also called Meibomian glands, are located along the edges of the eyelids.  
They secrete oils that form the outer tear film layer, preventing evaporation.  
Energetically, they represent balance, stability, and protection of clarity.

###Parts###

##Gland Rows##  
Parallel rows within the eyelids that secrete protective oils.  
Energetically, they symbolize order and calm strength.

##Duct Openings##  
Tiny pores along the eyelid margins where oil is released.  
Energetically, they represent flow and gentle protection.

##Eyelid Margin##  
Protects the eye surface and ensures tear stability.  
Energetically, it reflects healthy boundaries and resilience.

###Function###  
Tarsal glands maintain a stable tear film and prevent dryness.  
They keep the eyes smooth and shielded from dust.  
Energetically, they promote equilibrium and harmony, supporting both physical and emotional vision.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blocked glands: swelling or irritation along eyelid edges.  
Dry eyes: reduced oil production.  
Inflammation: infection or meibomitis.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect boundary issues or suppressed clarity.

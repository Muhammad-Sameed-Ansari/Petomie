#Vestibular Glands (Bartholin’s Glands)#

The mare’s vestibular glands lie within the vaginal vestibule near the vulva.  
They produce mucus that provides lubrication during mating and protects delicate tissues.  
Energetically, they represent feminine flow, receptivity, and gentle emotional openness.

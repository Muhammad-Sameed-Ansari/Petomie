#Uterine Glands#

The mare’s uterine glands lie throughout the inner lining of the uterus.  
They secrete nutrient-rich fluids essential for early embryo development before placental attachment.  
Energetically, they represent creation, nurturing, and the deep feminine power of growth.

###Parts###

##Glandular Tubules##  
Produce uterine milk (histotrophe) to nourish the embryo.  
Energetically, they symbolize inner support, fertility, and creative energy.

##Secretory Cells##  
Release proteins, nutrients, and protective substances.  
Energetically, they reflect generosity, care, and emotional nourishment.

##Stromal Support##  
Provides a stable foundation within the uterine lining.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, readiness, and fertile potential.

###Function###  
Uterine glands maintain uterine health and nourish embryos in early pregnancy.  
Energetically, they support creation, deep nurturing, and inner expansion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Reduced secretion: hormonal imbalance or fertility issues.  
Inflammation: irritation or infection.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disrupted creative flow or weakened nurturing energy.

#Mammary Gland#

##Location##
Situated in the inguinal (groin) region between the hind limbs. In the mare, there are two mammary glands (one in each half of the udder), each with its own teat and duct system leading to the gland cistern.

##Shape##
Composed of glandular and connective tissue structures including:
- **Glandular Tissue:** Lobulated structures made up of alveoli where milk is produced and secreted.
- **Lactiferous Ducts:** Channels that transport milk from the alveoli to the teat cistern.
- **Teat (Nipple):** Cylindrical projection allowing milk ejection during suckling.
- **Suspensory Ligaments:** Fibrous connective tissue that supports and anchors the udder to the abdominal wall.
- **Adipose Tissue:** Surrounds and cushions the gland, providing insulation and protection.

##Function##
Produces and secretes milk to nourish foals postpartum
Supports maternal bonding and neonatal survival
Provides antibodies (colostrum) to boost immune protection in newborn foals
Maintains mammary health and milk flow through hormonal regulation and reflex stimulation

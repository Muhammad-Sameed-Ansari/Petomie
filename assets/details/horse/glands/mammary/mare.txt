#Mammary Glands – Mare#

##Location##
In the mare, the mammary glands are found between the hind legs in the groin area, forming the udder. 
There are two separate glands, each with its own teat and network of milk-producing tissues.

###Shape###
Two soft, rounded glands, smooth to the touch, that can enlarge during pregnancy or lactation. 
Each contains alveoli (milk-producing cells) connected by ducts leading to the teats.

##Function##
- Produce milk after foaling to nourish and strengthen the foal.
- Secrete colostrum, rich in antibodies, which supports the foal’s immune protection.
- Reflect the mare’s emotional and hormonal balance — stress or fear can reduce milk flow.

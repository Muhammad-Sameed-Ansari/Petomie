#Mammary Glands – Stallion#

##Location##
The stallion has rudimentary mammary glands located in the same groin area between the hind legs, but they remain undeveloped and non-functional. 
They are small, flat tissues beneath the skin and are often unnoticed.

###Shape###
Two tiny, inactive glandular areas, similar in placement to the mare’s, but without ducts or secretory cells.

##Function##
- Inactive in males — they do not produce milk.
- Remnants of early embryonic development, showing that all mammals begin with similar gland structures before gender differentiation.
- Energetically, they carry balance between giving and receiving energy rather than physical function.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Heart and Solar Plexus Chakras – balance of strength and compassion.
- **Meridian Connections:** Stomach and Governing Vessel Meridians.
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represent balanced masculine energy, combining protection with emotional sensitivity. Imbalance may appear as emotional rigidity or disconnection from nurturing instincts.
- **Balanced Energy:** Strength guided by empathy and awareness.
- **Energetic Support:** Grounding, gentle touch, and balanced interaction with herd members help harmonize nurturing and assertive energies.

#Ocular Structures#

##Location##
Positioned within the bony orbits of the skull, on each side of the horse’s head. The eyes are large and laterally placed, providing an extensive field of vision suited to prey animals. They are supported by surrounding muscles, glands, and connective tissue.

##Shape##
Composed of several anatomical components including:
- **Cornea:** Transparent front layer that refracts and focuses incoming light.
- **Sclera:** Dense, fibrous outer coat maintaining the shape of the eyeball.
- **Iris and Pupil:** The colored diaphragm and central opening controlling light entry.
- **Lens:** Clear, flexible structure that focuses light onto the retina.
- **Retina:** Inner layer containing photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into neural signals.
- **Optic Nerve:** Transmits visual impulses from the retina to the brain.
- **Aqueous and Vitreous Humor:** Fluids that maintain intraocular pressure and optical clarity.
- **Nictitating Membrane (Third Eyelid):** Protective fold sweeping across the eye for cleaning and lubrication.

##Function##
Captures and focuses light to form visual images
Converts light signals into nerve impulses for brain interpretation
Protects the eye surface through blinking and nictitating membrane movement
Maintains intraocular pressure and optical stability for clear vision
Supports wide-angle visual awareness essential for navigation and detecting movement

#Lymph Glands#

The horse’s lymph glands are part of the lymphatic system, distributed throughout the body.  
They act as filters for lymph fluid and play a major role in immune defense.  
Energetically, they represent purification, clarity, and emotional flow.

###Parts###

##Superficial Lymph Glands##  
Located near the jaw, shoulders, and groin.  
Energetically, they symbolize surface awareness and protection.

##Deep Lymph Glands##  
Surround major organs and blood vessels.  
Energetically, they represent internal strength and endurance.

##Lymphatic Vessels##  
Carry lymph between glands.  
Energetically, they reflect movement, cleansing, and renewal.

###Function###  
Lymph glands purify lymph fluid, trap pathogens, and support immune strength.  
Energetically, they cleanse old energy and maintain balance between body and emotion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: detox or immune challenge.  
Blockage: stagnation or resistance to change.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect holding emotional waste or lack of flow.

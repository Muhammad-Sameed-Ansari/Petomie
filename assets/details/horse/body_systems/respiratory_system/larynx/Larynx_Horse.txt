#Larynx#

##Location##
Located at the junction between the pharynx and trachea, in the upper part of the neck. In the horse, it lies ventral to the first few cervical vertebrae and extends from the root of the tongue to the entrance of the trachea. It can be palpated externally in the throatlatch region.

##Shape##
A hollow, cartilaginous structure forming the upper part of the respiratory tract, composed of several key components:
- **Epiglottis:** Leaf-shaped cartilage that folds down during swallowing to prevent food from entering the trachea.
- **Thyroid Cartilage:** Largest cartilage forming the lateral and ventral walls of the larynx.
- **Cricoid Cartilage:** Ring-shaped structure forming the base of the larynx and connecting it to the trachea.
- **Arytenoid Cartilages:** Paired, pyramid-shaped cartilages controlling the opening and closing of the glottis.
- **Glottis:** Opening between the vocal folds that regulates airflow.
- **Intrinsic and Extrinsic Muscles:** Control movement of the cartilages and tension of the vocal cords.

##Function##
Regulates airflow between the pharynx and trachea
Prevents food and foreign material from entering the lower airways during swallowing
Produces sound and vocalization through vibration of the vocal folds
Controls airway diameter during breathing and exercise
Assists in coughing, swallowing, and pressure regulation within the respiratory system

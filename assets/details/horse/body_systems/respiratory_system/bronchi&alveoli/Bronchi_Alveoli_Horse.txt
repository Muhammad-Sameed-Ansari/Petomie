#Bronchi & Alveoli#

##Location##
Located within the lungs, branching from the trachea deep into the pulmonary tissue. The bronchi form the primary airway network, while the alveoli occupy the terminal ends of this system, filling the lung lobes where gas exchange occurs.

##Shape##
- **Bronchi:**  
  - *Primary (Main) Bronchi:* Two large branches from the trachea entering each lung at the hilus.  
  - *Secondary (Lobar) Bronchi:* Supply individual lobes of each lung.  
  - *Tertiary (Segmental) Bronchi:* Further divide into smaller bronchi and bronchioles.  
  - *Bronchioles:* Narrow, smooth muscle tubes lacking cartilage, leading to alveolar ducts.  
  - *Structure:* Lined with ciliated epithelium and mucus-producing cells for filtration and humidification.  

- **Alveoli:**  
  - *Microscopic Air Sacs:* Thin-walled, spherical structures surrounded by capillary networks.  
  - *Alveolar Walls (Septae):* Composed of simple squamous epithelium and elastic fibers.  
  - *Type I Cells:* Facilitate gas exchange.  
  - *Type II Cells:* Secrete surfactant to prevent collapse during exhalation.  

##Function##
- **Bronchi:**  
  - Conduct air from the trachea to the alveoli.  
  - Filter, moisten, and warm inhaled air through mucous lining and cilia.  
  - Regulate airflow distribution through smooth muscle contraction and dilation.  

- **Alveoli:**  
  - Serve as the primary sites for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with blood.  
  - Maintain surface tension balance via surfactant secretion.  
  - Support efficient oxygen delivery during rest and high-intensity exercise.  
  - Contribute to overall respiratory efficiency through elastic recoil and ventilation-perfusion balance.

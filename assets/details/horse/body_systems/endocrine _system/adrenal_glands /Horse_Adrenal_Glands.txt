#Adrenal Glands#

##Location##
Located cranial to each kidney, embedded in the fat surrounding the renal capsule.  
The right adrenal gland lies close to the caudal vena cava, while the left adrenal gland is near the aorta and slightly more caudal in position.

##Shape##
Small, flattened, oval-shaped endocrine glands with distinct outer and inner regions.  
- **Cortex:** Outer yellowish zone producing steroid hormones; divided into three layers:
  - **Zona Glomerulosa:** Produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) for electrolyte balance.
  - **Zona Fasciculata:** Secretes glucocorticoids (cortisol) regulating metabolism and stress response.
  - **Zona Reticularis:** Produces small amounts of sex hormones (androgens).  
- **Medulla:** Central dark area producing catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) that control the body’s stress response.
- **Capsule:** Thin fibrous covering that maintains gland shape and provides protection.

##Function##
Essential endocrine organs that help regulate metabolism, stress, and fluid balance.  
- **Cortex:** Controls salt, water, and carbohydrate metabolism; influences immune and inflammatory responses.  
- **Medulla:** Initiates the “fight or flight” response by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels.  
- **Overall Role:** Maintains homeostasis during stress, physical exertion, or emotional excitement by integrating hormonal and nervous system functions.

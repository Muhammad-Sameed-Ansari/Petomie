#Esophagus#

##Location##
Extends from the pharynx in the throat to the stomach, running along the left side of the neck and through the thoracic cavity. It passes dorsal to the trachea, through the diaphragm, and enters the stomach at the cardia region. In horses, it lies mostly on the left side of the neck, making choke (esophageal obstruction) clinically observable.

##Shape##
A long, muscular tube approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters in length, composed of several layers:
- **Mucosa:** Lined with stratified squamous epithelium that resists abrasion from coarse feed.
- **Submucosa:** Contains glands that secrete mucus to lubricate ingesta.
- **Muscular Layer:** Upper third is striated muscle, middle portion mixed, and lower third smooth muscle for peristaltic movement.
- **Adventitia:** Outer connective tissue layer providing support and flexibility.
- **Cardiac Sphincter:** Strong muscular valve at the stomach entrance that prevents vomiting, unique in horses.

##Function##
Transports food and water from the mouth to the stomach through coordinated peristaltic waves
Lubricates ingesta with mucus to ease swallowing
Prevents backflow from the stomach due to the powerful cardiac sphincter
Plays a crucial role in initial digestion by delivering chewed feed to the stomach
Serves as a one-way passage ensuring safe transit of bolus during feeding

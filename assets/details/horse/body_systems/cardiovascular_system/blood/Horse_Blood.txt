#Blood#

##Location##
Circulates throughout the entire body within a closed network of arteries, veins, and capillaries.
Produced primarily in the red bone marrow of flat and long bones such as the sternum, ribs, pelvis, and femur.
Continuously flows through the heart, lungs, and systemic vessels, delivering oxygen and nutrients to all tissues and removing metabolic waste.

##Shape##
A fluid connective tissue composed of cellular and liquid components that form a dynamic transport medium.
- **Plasma:** The liquid portion (≈55%) containing water, proteins (albumin, globulins, fibrinogen), electrolytes, hormones, nutrients, and waste products.
- **Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells):** Biconcave discs lacking nuclei; carry oxygen via hemoglobin and transport carbon dioxide.
- **Leukocytes (White Blood Cells):** Nucleated cells responsible for immune defense and inflammation control.
- **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Small cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes; initiate clotting to prevent blood loss.
- **Viscosity & Color:** Bright red when oxygenated, dark maroon when deoxygenated; slightly more viscous than water.

##Function##
Maintains internal stability and homeostasis by transporting vital substances and regulating physiological processes.
- **Transports oxygen, nutrients, and hormones** to cells.
- **Removes carbon dioxide and metabolic waste** via lungs and kidneys.
- **Regulates body temperature, pH, and fluid balance.**
- **Defends against infection** through immune cells and antibodies.
- **Clots at injury sites** to prevent blood loss.
- **Serves as a communication medium** for hormones and signaling molecules coordinating organ function.

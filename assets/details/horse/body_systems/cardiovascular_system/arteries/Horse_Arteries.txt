#Arteries#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the body, carrying oxygenated blood away from the heart to all tissues and organs.
The main trunk, the **aorta**, arises from the left ventricle and branches into major arteries supplying the head, limbs, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.
- **Carotid Arteries:** Supply the head and brain.
- **Subclavian Arteries:** Supply the forelimbs and thoracic wall.
- **Celiac, Mesenteric, and Renal Arteries:** Supply abdominal organs.
- **External and Internal Iliac Arteries:** Supply the hindlimbs and pelvic region.

##Shape##
Thick-walled, elastic, and muscular tubular vessels capable of withstanding high pressure generated by the heart.
- **Tunica Intima:** Smooth endothelial lining reducing friction and aiding laminar blood flow.
- **Tunica Media:** Thick layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibers enabling contraction and expansion with each heartbeat.
- **Tunica Externa:** Outer connective tissue providing strength and flexibility.
- **Elastic Arteries:** Large arteries like the aorta and pulmonary arteries that maintain pressure during diastole.
- **Muscular Arteries:** Medium-sized vessels that distribute blood to specific organs and regions.
- **Arterioles:** Small terminal branches regulating blood flow into capillary beds via vasoconstriction and dilation.

##Function##
Transport oxygenated blood from the heart to all body parts under high pressure.
- **Distribute oxygen and nutrients** through branching networks to organs and tissues.
- **Regulate blood pressure and flow** through smooth muscle contraction and relaxation.
- **Maintain continuous circulation** via elastic recoil between heartbeats.
- **Assist in thermoregulation** by controlling blood supply to the skin and extremities.
- **Serve as pressure reservoirs**, ensuring steady blood delivery during cardiac cycles.

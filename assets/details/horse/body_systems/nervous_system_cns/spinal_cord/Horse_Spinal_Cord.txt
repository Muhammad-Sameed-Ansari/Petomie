#Spinal Cord#

##Location##
Extends from the medulla oblongata at the base of the brain through the vertebral canal, protected by the vertebrae.
Runs from the foramen magnum to approximately the level of the second sacral vertebra (S2) in the horse.
Surrounded by three protective meninges — the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater — and cushioned by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the subarachnoid space.

##Shape##
A long, cylindrical cord slightly flattened dorsoventrally.
- **Cervical and Lumbar Enlargements:** Expanded regions where nerves supplying the limbs originate.
- **Gray Matter:** Central “butterfly-shaped” area containing neuron cell bodies.
- **White Matter:** Outer layer composed of myelinated nerve fibers transmitting signals.
- **Central Canal:** Small internal channel filled with cerebrospinal fluid.
- **Spinal Nerves:** Emerge in pairs from each segment, forming the peripheral nerves supplying body structures.
- **Cauda Equina:** Bundle of nerve roots continuing beyond the cord’s end in the lumbar region.

##Function##
Acts as the main communication pathway between the brain and the body.
- **Transmits sensory information** from the body to the brain.
- **Carries motor commands** from the brain to muscles and glands.
- **Coordinates reflexes** through local neural circuits for immediate, involuntary responses.
- **Maintains body posture and balance** through integrated reflex and motor control.
- Works closely with the brainstem and peripheral nervous system to regulate movement, sensation, and organ function.

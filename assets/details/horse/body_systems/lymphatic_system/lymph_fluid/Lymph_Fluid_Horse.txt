#Lymph Fluid#

##Location##
Found within the lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and thoracic duct, circulating throughout the lymphatic system. It originates from interstitial fluid that has been filtered from blood capillaries and collected into lymphatic capillaries across the horse’s body.

##Shape##
A clear to slightly yellowish fluid with a watery consistency composed of:
- **Plasma-like Component:** Derived from interstitial fluid containing water, electrolytes, and proteins.
- **Cells:** Includes lymphocytes, macrophages, and occasional dendritic cells.
- **Fats (Chyle):** Absorbed from the intestines, giving lymph a milky appearance post-feeding.
- **Flow Pattern:** Moves slowly under low pressure toward the thoracic duct through rhythmic vessel contractions and body movements.

##Function##
Transports immune cells (lymphocytes) to and from lymph nodes for defense and filtration
Returns proteins, fluids, and waste from tissues to the bloodstream
Carries absorbed fats from the intestines to the circulatory system
Acts as a medium for immune cell communication and antigen transport
Maintains tissue fluid balance and prevents swelling or edema

#Lymph Nodes#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the horse’s body along major lymphatic vessels, often grouped regionally near organs and joints. Prominent clusters are found in the head, neck, thoracic cavity, abdomen, and limbs.

##Shape##
Small, bean-shaped structures composed of lymphoid tissue enclosed in a fibrous capsule:
- **Parotid and Mandibular Nodes:** Located near the jaw and parotid salivary glands.
- **Retropharyngeal Nodes:** Found deep in the throat region.
- **Cervical Nodes:** Along the jugular vein and trachea.
- **Axillary and Inguinal Nodes:** Present in the shoulder and groin areas.
- **Mesenteric Nodes:** Numerous nodes embedded within the mesentery of the intestines.
- **Structure:** Each node contains a cortex (with lymph follicles), medulla (sinuses and cords), and afferent/efferent vessels for lymph flow.

##Function##
Filter lymph fluid to remove pathogens, debris, and cancer cells
Produce lymphocytes (B and T cells) for immune defense
Act as immune surveillance centers detecting infections
Drain specific body regions to maintain fluid and immune balance
Assist in returning clean lymph to the bloodstream via the thoracic duct

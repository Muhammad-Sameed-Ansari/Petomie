##Olfactory Nerve (I)##

#Location#  
Located in the nasal cavity; fibers pass through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb.

#Shape#  
Fine sensory filaments extending from olfactory epithelium to the brain.

#Function#  
Transmits the sense of smell to the brain.


##Optic Nerve (II)##

#Location#  
Extends from the retina through the optic canal to the optic chiasm and brain.

#Shape#  
Thick, cord-like sensory nerve bundle.

#Function#  
Carries visual impulses from the retina to the brain for vision.


##Oculomotor Nerve (III)##

#Location#  
Originates from the midbrain, enters the orbit through the orbital fissure.

#Shape#  
Small motor nerve trunk branching to several eye muscles.

#Function#  
Controls most eye movements, pupil constriction, and eyelid elevation.


##Trochlear Nerve (IV)##

#Location#  
Emerges dorsally from the midbrain, passes through the orbital fissure to the eye.

#Shape#  
Thin motor filament.

#Function#  
Innervates the dorsal oblique muscle, rotating the eye downward and inward.


##Trigeminal Nerve (V)##

#Location#  
Originates from the pons; three major branches pass through skull foramina to the face and jaw.

#Shape#  
Large mixed nerve with ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular divisions.

#Function#  
Provides facial sensation and motor control for mastication muscles.


##Abducens Nerve (VI)##

#Location#  
Arises from the medulla, enters the orbit through the orbital fissure.

#Shape#  
Thin motor nerve.

#Function#  
Controls lateral movement of the eye via the lateral rectus and retractor bulbi muscles.


##Facial Nerve (VII)##

#Location#  
Emerges from the medulla, exits skull via the stylomastoid foramen, branches across the face.

#Shape#  
Medium-sized mixed nerve with multiple facial branches.

#Function#  
Controls facial expression, ear and lip movement, tear and saliva secretion, and taste on the rostral tongue.


##Vestibulocochlear Nerve (VIII)##

#Location#  
Arises from the inner ear structures to the brainstem.

#Shape#  
Sensory nerve with two divisions: vestibular (balance) and cochlear (hearing).

#Function#  
Responsible for hearing and maintaining balance and spatial orientation.


##Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX)##

#Location#  
Originates from the medulla, exits through the jugular foramen to the tongue and pharynx.

#Shape#  
Mixed sensory and motor nerve.

#Function#  
Provides taste (caudal tongue), controls swallowing, and sensory input from pharynx.


##Vagus Nerve (X)##

#Location#  
Arises from the medulla, travels through the neck within the carotid sheath to thoracic and abdominal organs.

#Shape#  
Long mixed nerve with extensive branching.

#Function#  
Controls muscles of larynx and pharynx, regulates heart rate, respiration, and digestive activity.


##Accessory Nerve (XI)##

#Location#  
Arises from medulla and cervical spinal cord; enters skull then exits via jugular foramen.

#Shape#  
Motor nerve with cranial and spinal roots.

#Function#  
Innervates neck and shoulder muscles including trapezius, brachiocephalicus, and sternocephalicus.


##Hypoglossal Nerve (XII)##

#Location#  
Emerges from the medulla and exits through the hypoglossal canal to the tongue.

#Shape#  
Motor nerve coursing along the ventral aspect of the neck.

#Function#  
Controls movement of the tongue during chewing, swallowing, and vocalization.

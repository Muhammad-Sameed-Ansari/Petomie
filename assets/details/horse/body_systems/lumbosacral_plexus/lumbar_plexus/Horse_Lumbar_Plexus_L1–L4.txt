##Lumbar Plexus (L1–L4)##

#Location#  
Formed by the ventral branches of the first through fourth lumbar spinal nerves (L1–L4).  
Located within the sublumbar region, embedded in the psoas major muscle on the ventral surface of the lumbar vertebrae.  
Branches emerge laterally to supply the abdominal wall and cranial portions of the hindlimb.

#Shape#  
A compact, fan-like network of nerve fibers that spread outward from the lumbar spinal cord.  
Each branch divides to form individual nerves that extend toward the abdominal wall, thigh, and pelvic area.

#Parts#  
- L1–L2: Give rise to the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genitofemoral nerves, supplying abdominal and inguinal regions.  
- L3–L4: Contribute to the femoral and obturator nerves, which continue to the thigh muscles.  
- Minor communicating branches connect with the sympathetic trunk and sacral plexus.

#Function#  
Provides motor and sensory innervation to the abdominal wall, flank, and cranial part of the hindlimb.  
Controls movements of the hip flexors and thigh adductors, and conveys sensation from the skin of the flank and medial thigh.

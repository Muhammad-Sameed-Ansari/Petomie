#Shoulder Girdle & Brachium#

##Location##
Located in the forelimb region connecting the thorax to the upper limb. The shoulder girdle comprises the scapula (no clavicle in horses) and associated muscles attaching it to the thoracic wall. The brachium, or upper arm, extends from the scapulohumeral (shoulder) joint to the elbow, containing the humerus and its surrounding musculature.

##Shape##
The shoulder girdle consists of flat and broad muscle groups that suspend the trunk between the forelimbs, acting as a muscular sling. The brachium features robust flexor and extensor muscles that facilitate forward propulsion and weight-bearing during locomotion.

##Function##
Supports the body between the forelimbs via the thoracic sling (serratus ventralis, pectorals, trapezius, rhomboideus)
Allows movement of the forelimb through protraction, retraction, and elevation of the scapula
Provides flexion and extension of the shoulder and elbow joints through brachial muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachialis, deltoid)
Absorbs impact during locomotion and contributes to stride length and limb stability

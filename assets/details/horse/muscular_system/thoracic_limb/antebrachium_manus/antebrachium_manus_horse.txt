#Antebrachium & Manus#

##Location##
The antebrachium (forearm) lies between the elbow (humeroradioulnar joint) and the carpus (knee). It consists primarily of the radius and a reduced ulna. The manus (forefoot) extends from the carpus to the hoof and includes the carpal, metacarpal, and digital bones.

##Shape##
The antebrachium is long and cylindrical, containing major extensor and flexor muscle groups located along the cranial and caudal surfaces. The manus includes the complex carpal joint, the elongated metacarpus (MC III as the cannon bone, with MC II and IV as splint bones), and the single functional digit protected by the hoof capsule.

##Function##
Facilitates flexion, extension, and stabilization of the carpal and digital joints during movement
Supports weight-bearing and shock absorption through tendinous and ligamentous structures
Provides propulsion during locomotion via coordinated muscle and tendon action (especially flexor and extensor tendons)
Allows fine adjustments in stride and balance, essential for gait efficiency and limb alignment

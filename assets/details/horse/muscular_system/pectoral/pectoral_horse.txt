#Superficial & Deep#

##Location##
Situated on the ventral chest between the forelimbs, connecting the sternum to the humerus and scapula. In the horse, these muscles form part of the thoracic sling that supports the trunk between the forelimbs.

##Shape##
Composed of two main layers:
- **Superficial pectoral muscles (descending and transverse):** Flat and fan-shaped, covering the front and sides of the chest.
- **Deep pectoral muscle (ascending):** Thick and powerful, extending from the sternum to the humerus beneath the superficial layer.

##Function##
Adducts the forelimbs, drawing them toward the body’s midline
Supports the trunk between the forelimbs (part of the thoracic sling)
Assists in retraction and stabilization of the forelimb during movement
Aids in propulsion and balance, particularly during push-off and landing phases of gait

#Ventral Muscles#

##Location##
Situated along the ventral aspect of the horse’s body, extending from the thoracic region to the pelvic area. These muscles form the ventral body wall and include key components of the abdominal and thoracic musculature.

##Shape##
Broad, flat sheets of muscle forming layered structures that protect and support internal organs:
- **Pectoral Muscles (Superficial & Deep):** Located on the chest, connecting the sternum to the forelimb.  
- **Abdominal Muscles:** Include the external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis.  
- **Subcostal and Intercostal Muscles:** Situated between the ribs, aiding in respiration.  
- **Linea Alba:** Central fibrous seam connecting the left and right abdominal muscles.  
- **Composition:** Primarily skeletal muscle fibers arranged in overlapping layers providing strength and flexibility.

##Function##
Support and protect abdominal and thoracic organs
Assist in respiration by controlling thoracic pressure during inhalation and exhalation
Enable trunk flexion, stabilization, and posture maintenance
Facilitate defecation, urination, foaling, and coughing by increasing intra-abdominal pressure
Transfer movement forces between limbs and trunk during locomotion

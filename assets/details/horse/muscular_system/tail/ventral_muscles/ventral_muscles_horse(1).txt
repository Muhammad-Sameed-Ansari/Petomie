#Ventral Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the underside (ventral aspect) of the horse’s neck, thorax, and abdomen. These muscles form the ventral body wall and support vital organs while linking the sternum, ribs, and pelvis. They lie below the vertebral column and complement the dorsal (epaxial) muscle system.

##Shape##
Broad, flat, and layered muscle sheets interlaced with tendinous tissue. Major groups include:
- **Neck Region:** Sternocephalicus, sternothyrohyoid complex for head and larynx movement.
- **Thoracic Region:** Superficial and deep pectorals forming the ventral chest sling.
- **Abdominal Region:** External and internal obliques, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis forming the abdominal wall.

##Function##
Supports and compresses the thoracic and abdominal viscera
Flexes the neck and trunk, aiding in posture and core stabilization
Assists in expiration and breathing control
Transfers power from the hindquarters through the core during locomotion
Maintains organ support and aids in defecation, urination, and foaling

#Intrinsic Muscles#

##Location##
Located entirely within the region they act upon, without attachment to the axial skeleton. In the horse, intrinsic muscles are found within the limbs and specific body regions such as the larynx, tongue, and intervertebral spaces. Limb intrinsic muscles lie distal to the shoulder and hip joints, controlling fine movements of the joints and digits.

##Shape##
Generally smaller, spindle-shaped, or strap-like muscles adapted for precision and stability. Examples include:
- **Interosseous (Suspensory Ligament):** Deep to the flexor tendons in the distal limb.
- **Intercostal Muscles:** Between ribs, aiding respiration.
- **Deep Digital Flexors and Extensors:** Within limbs for joint control.
- **Laryngeal Intrinsic Muscles:** Surround the larynx for voice and airway regulation.

##Function##
Provide fine motor control within specific regions such as the limbs, spine, and larynx
Stabilize joints and coordinate delicate movements during locomotion
Support posture and precise muscle tone in specialized actions
Assist in respiration, phonation, and limb balance under dynamic conditions

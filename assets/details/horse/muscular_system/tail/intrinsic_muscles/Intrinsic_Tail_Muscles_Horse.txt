#Intrinsic Muscles of the Tail#

##Location##
Located at the base and along the length of the tail, extending from the sacrum and caudal vertebrae to the skin and connective tissue of the tail. These muscles are situated deep beneath the superficial tail fascia and are attached to the caudal vertebrae.

##Shape##
Small, paired muscles arranged longitudinally and laterally along the tail’s dorsal and ventral aspects:
- **Dorsal Muscles:** Include the dorsal sacrocaudalis and intertransversarii caudae muscles that elevate and extend the tail.
- **Ventral Muscles:** Such as the ventral sacrocaudalis and interarcuate muscles that depress and flex the tail.
- **Lateral Muscles:** Small oblique bundles responsible for side-to-side tail movement.
- **Structure:** Composed of striated skeletal muscle fibers capable of fine, rapid contractions.

##Function##
Provide precise control of tail movement for balance, communication, and fly protection
Assist in elevation, flexion, and lateral motion of the tail
Aid in expressive signaling and social behavior among horses
Support spinal alignment and stability of the caudal vertebrae during locomotion
Contribute to muscular tone and postural coordination at the tail base

#Dorsal Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the dorsal aspect of the horse’s body, extending from the neck to the tail. These muscles form the upper part of the trunk and lie above the vertebral column, supporting and moving the spine and head.

##Shape##
Composed of strong, elongated muscle groups arranged longitudinally along the vertebrae and ribs:
- **Epaxial Muscles:** Include the longissimus dorsi, iliocostalis, and spinalis muscles — the main extensors of the back.
- **Splenius and Semispinalis:** Found in the neck region, raising and stabilizing the head and neck.  
- **Multifidus and Interspinalis:** Deep stabilizing muscles connecting adjacent vertebrae for fine spinal control.  
- **Structure:** Layered from deep to superficial, composed of striated skeletal fibers adapted for endurance and strength.

##Function##
Extend and stabilize the vertebral column during movement
Maintain posture and balance during locomotion and collection
Coordinate head, neck, and back movements for flexibility and lifting of the topline
Support engagement of the hindquarters and energy transfer to the forehand
Assist in breathing by aiding expansion of the ribcage during inspiration

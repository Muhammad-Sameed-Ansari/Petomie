#Hip & Thigh#

##Location##
Located in the hindquarter region, extending from the pelvis to the stifle. This area includes the gluteal region, lateral and medial thigh muscles, and hamstring group. It connects the pelvis to the femur and tibia, forming the primary power unit of the hindlimb.

##Shape##
Comprises large, strong muscle groups including:
- **Gluteal Muscles (superficial, middle, deep):** Rounded and powerful, forming the croup and upper hindquarters.
- **Quadriceps Femoris:** Four-headed muscle group on the cranial thigh, inserting via the patellar tendon.
- **Hamstring Group (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus):** Long, muscular bands along the caudal thigh.
- **Adductors, Sartorius, and Gracilis:** Medial thigh muscles stabilizing and drawing the limb inward.

##Function##
Provides propulsion during locomotion by extending the hip and stifle joints
Supports weight transfer from the pelvis to the limb during stance and movement
Controls hindlimb retraction, flexion, and abduction during stride
Stabilizes the pelvis and contributes to balance, jumping power, and acceleration

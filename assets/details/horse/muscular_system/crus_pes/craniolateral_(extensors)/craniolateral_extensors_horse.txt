#Craniolateral (Extensors)#

##Location##
Located on the craniolateral surface of the crus (lower hind leg), extending from the distal femur and tibia to the metatarsal and phalangeal bones. This group lies in front of and to the side of the tibia, just beneath the skin.

##Shape##
Composed of elongated, spindle-shaped muscles with long tendons that pass over the hock. Major muscles include:
- **Long Digital Extensor:** Runs down the front of the leg to the extensor process of the distal phalanx.
- **Lateral Digital Extensor:** Lies laterally and fuses partly with the long digital extensor tendon.
- **Peroneus Tertius:** A strong, tendinous structure that links hock and stifle motion.
- **Tibialis Cranialis:** Lies cranial to the tibia and assists in hock flexion.

##Function##
Extends the digit and flexes the hock
Coordinates simultaneous movement of stifle and hock through the reciprocal apparatus
Stabilizes the limb during the swing phase of locomotion
Assists in forward advancement of the limb and hoof placement

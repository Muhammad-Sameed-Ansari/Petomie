#Lateral Pterygoid#

##Location##
Located deep in the pterygoid region, extending from the lateral surface of the sphenoid bone to the medial surface of the mandibular condyle and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint. Lies cranial to the medial pterygoid.

##Shape##
Small, short, and somewhat conical muscle composed of horizontally oriented fibers. It has a distinct tendon that blends with the joint capsule of the temporomandibular joint.

##Function##
Protracts the mandible, pulling it forward during chewing
Assists in opening the mouth by drawing the mandibular condyle rostrally
Contributes to lateral jaw movement when acting unilaterally
Stabilizes the temporomandibular joint during complex chewing motions

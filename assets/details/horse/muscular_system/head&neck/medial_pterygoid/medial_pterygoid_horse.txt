#Medial Pterygoid#

##Location##
Situated on the medial side of the mandible within the pterygoid fossa. It extends from the pterygoid and palatine bones to the medial surface of the mandibular ramus and angle. Lies opposite the masseter, forming a muscular sling around the mandible.

##Shape##
Thick, broad, and rectangular muscle with oblique fibers running downward and backward. Its mirror-like position to the masseter allows coordinated compression and balance of the jaw.

##Function##
Elevates the mandible to close the mouth
Assists in side-to-side (lateral) jaw movement during grinding
Works synergistically with the masseter to stabilize the mandible
Provides controlled pressure against the maxillary dental arcade during mastication

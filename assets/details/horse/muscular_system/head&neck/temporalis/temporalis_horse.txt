#Temporalis#

##Location##
Located on the temporal fossa of the skull, covering the lateral and dorsal aspects of the cranium between the zygomatic arch and the midline of the head. It lies deep to the temporal fascia and extends to the coronoid process of the mandible.

##Shape##
Broad, fan-shaped muscle with converging fibers running from the temporal bone to a strong tendon inserting on the coronoid process. Its wide origin provides strong leverage for mandibular elevation.

##Function##
Elevates and retracts the mandible to close the mouth
Provides the main force for the vertical (up-and-down) chewing motion
Assists in stabilizing the jaw during biting and grinding
Supports the temporomandibular joint by maintaining alignment during mastication

#Inspiratory & Expiratory Muscles#

##Location##
Located within the thoracic and abdominal regions, surrounding the rib cage, diaphragm, and abdominal wall. These muscles coordinate the expansion and contraction of the thoracic cavity to facilitate breathing.

##Shape##
**Inspiratory Muscles:**
- **Diaphragm:** Dome-shaped musculotendinous partition separating thoracic and abdominal cavities.
- **External Intercostals:** Situated between ribs with fibers running caudoventrally, expanding the rib cage.
- **Scalenus and Serratus Ventralis:** Assist in elevating the ribs and drawing air into the lungs.

**Expiratory Muscles:**
- **Internal Intercostals:** Deeper rib muscles with fibers running cranioventrally, compressing the thorax.
- **Abdominal Muscles (External/Internal Obliques, Transversus Abdominis, Rectus Abdominis):** Push abdominal viscera against the diaphragm to expel air.

##Function##
**Inspiration:**
- Enlarges thoracic cavity and decreases intrathoracic pressure
- Draws air into the lungs through diaphragm contraction and rib elevation

**Expiration:**
- Reduces thoracic volume and increases internal pressure to expel air
- Aids in vocalization, coughing, and stabilization of the trunk during exertion
- Works synergistically with core muscles for posture and respiration efficiency

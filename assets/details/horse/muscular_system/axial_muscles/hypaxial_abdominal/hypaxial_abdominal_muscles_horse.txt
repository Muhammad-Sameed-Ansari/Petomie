#Hypaxial (Abdominal) Muscles#

##Location##
Situated along the ventral and lateral aspects of the abdominal wall, below (ventral to) the transverse processes of the vertebrae. These muscles extend from the rib cage and sternum to the pelvis, enclosing the abdominal cavity.

##Shape##
Composed of four major muscle layers arranged from superficial to deep:
- **External Abdominal Oblique:** Large, sheet-like muscle covering the ventrolateral abdomen with fibers running caudoventrally.
- **Internal Abdominal Oblique:** Lies beneath the external layer, with fibers running cranioventrally.
- **Transversus Abdominis:** Deepest layer, with fibers running dorsoventrally across the abdomen.
- **Rectus Abdominis:** Paired strap-like muscles running longitudinally along the ventral midline, enclosed in a fibrous sheath.

##Function##
Supports and compresses the abdominal viscera to maintain core stability
Assists in expiration by compressing the thoracic cavity
Flexes the vertebral column and stabilizes the trunk during locomotion
Aids in urination, defecation, foaling, and postural support
Contributes to collection and engagement of the hindquarters in performance horses

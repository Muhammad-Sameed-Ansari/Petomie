#Epaxial Muscles#

##Location##
Situated along the dorsal aspect of the vertebral column, extending from the sacrum and pelvis to the skull. These muscles lie above (dorsal to) the transverse processes of the vertebrae and are covered by fascia and skin.

##Shape##
Composed of three major longitudinal systems arranged in parallel layers:
- **Iliocostalis:** The most lateral group, extending from the ilium to the ribs and neck.
- **Longissimus:** The largest and intermediate group, spanning the entire vertebral column to the skull.
- **Spinalis:** The most medial group, located adjacent to the spinous processes.

Each system is composed of overlapping bundles providing strength and flexibility along the back.

##Function##
Extends and stabilizes the vertebral column during movement
Elevates the head and neck when acting bilaterally
Flexes the spine laterally when acting unilaterally
Supports posture, balance, and engagement of the topline during locomotion
Provides core strength for collection, jumping, and propulsion

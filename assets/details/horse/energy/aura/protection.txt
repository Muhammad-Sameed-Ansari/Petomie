#Aura Protection#

###Location###
Forms the outer boundary of the auric field, wrapping around the horse like an energetic shield.
Particularly strong around the heart, shoulders, and hindquarters—areas horses use most to interact socially and express boundaries.

###Shape###
A smooth, oval outer shell that thickens when the horse needs protection and softens when relaxed or bonded with trusted beings.

###Meaning & Function###
The protective layer filters external energies before they reach deeper levels of the aura.

Functions include:
Shielding from emotional or environmental chaos
Maintaining personal space
Reducing energetic drain from people or herd dynamics
Supporting emotional stability and confidence

A horse relies heavily on this layer to feel safe, especially due to its prey-animal awareness.

###Signs of Weak Aura Protection###
Difficulty maintaining boundaries
Being pushed around by other horses
Clinginess or separation anxiety
Over-sensitivity to sound or movement
Quick overwhelm or emotional flooding

###Balancing Activities###
Healthy herd interactions
Consistent routines
Boundary-building groundwork
Energetic sealing practices
Calm, grounding presence during handling

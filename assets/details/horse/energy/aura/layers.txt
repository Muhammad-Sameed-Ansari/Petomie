#Aura Layers#

###Location###
Encircle the horse in multiple concentric fields of subtle energy, extending several feet outward depending on the horse’s physical, emotional, and spiritual state.
These layers form the energetic bridge between body, mind, and spirit.

###Shape###
Large, oval layers that follow the horse’s full form—including head, neck, torso, limbs, and tail.
Each layer vibrates at a different frequency and purpose:

Etheric Layer: Closest to the skin/coat, mirroring muscles, organs, and structure.
Emotional Layer: Extends outward with feeling, herd interaction, and emotional memory.
Mental Layer: Relates to training, focus, responsiveness, and learned patterns.
Spiritual Layer: The outermost field, vast and luminous, connecting the horse to intuition, purpose, and higher awareness.

When balanced, these layers are bright, smooth, and harmoniously intertwined.

###Function###

##Etheric Layer##
Reflects physical health and vitality,
Carries life force into tissues, muscles, and organs,
Shows early signs of fatigue, tension, or illness,
Weakness may show as stiffness, lowered energy, or immune sensitivity.

##Emotional Layer##
Holds feelings, emotional history, and herd dynamics,
Shifts with safety, confidence, or stress,
Flows openly when the horse feels secure,
Becomes dense or cloudy during fear, grief, or confusion.

##Mental Layer##
Carries thought patterns, learned behaviors, and focus,
Supports clarity, training responsiveness, and cognitive balance,
Healthy when the horse shows understanding, willingness, and adaptability,
Distortion may cause confusion, resistance, or hyperreactivity.

##Spiritual Layer##
The most expansive and subtle,
Connects the horse to intuition, purpose, and universal consciousness,
Radiates peace, wisdom, and higher sensitivity,
Weakness may cause disconnection, fearfulness, or reduced life force.

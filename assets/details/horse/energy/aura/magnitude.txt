#Aura Magnitude#

###Location###
Surrounds the entire horse, extending outward from the skin and coat in a large, radiant field.
Because of the horse’s size and sensitivity, the aura can extend several feet from the body—especially around the heart, shoulders, barrel, and hindquarters.
It naturally expands when the horse feels calm, connected, or confident, and contracts during stress, pain, or environmental overload.

###Shape###
Large, oval, and expansive, flowing with the horse’s natural movement.
The magnitude shifts continuously, pulsing with breath, motion, and emotional tone.

###Meaning & Function###

A strong aura magnitude indicates:
High vitality and physical strength
Emotional clarity

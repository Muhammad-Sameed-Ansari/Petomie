#Pericardium Meridian (Xin Bao Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Pericardium Meridian** governs **protection of the heart, emotional balance, and circulation of joy**.  
It represents the ability to maintain openness while safeguarding sensitivity and inner truth.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the chest, travels along the inside of the forelimb, and ends at the tip of the middle fore hoof.  
This direct and steady pathway reflects how love and communication extend outward through touch and connection.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates circulation, protects the heart from stress, and balances emotional and physical heat.  
It supports calm interaction and helps the horse remain composed under pressure.  
Energetically, it governs affection, emotional boundaries, and empathy — the heart’s shield and bridge.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Heart palpitations, agitation, stiffness in the forelimb, or excessive sweating.  
Energetically, overexcitement, nervousness, or difficulty connecting with others.  
The horse may seem hypersensitive, anxious, or easily startled.

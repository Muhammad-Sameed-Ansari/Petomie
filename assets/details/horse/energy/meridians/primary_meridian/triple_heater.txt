#Triple Heater Meridian (San Jiao Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Triple Heater Meridian** governs **regulation, communication, and energy distribution** throughout the body.  
It represents harmony between the body’s three main centers — chest, abdomen, and pelvis — ensuring smooth coordination of all systems.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer tip of the fore hoof, travels up along the back of the forelimb, crosses the shoulder and neck, and ends near the ear.  
This pathway connects the periphery with the central body, coordinating warmth and energy exchange between upper and lower regions.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates body temperature, metabolism, and fluid distribution.  
It harmonizes the activities of the heart, lungs, and digestive organs, maintaining overall vitality.  
Energetically, it balances communication between the mind, heart, and body — aligning internal and external harmony.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling, stiffness in the neck or forelimb, or irregular sweating.  
Energetically, imbalance between activity and rest, frustration, or miscommunication.  
The horse may show inconsistent energy or difficulty adapting to changes.

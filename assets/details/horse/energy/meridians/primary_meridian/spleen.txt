#Spleen Meridian (Pi Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Spleen Meridian** governs **nourishment, transformation, and stability**.  
It represents the ability to absorb life experiences, convert them into strength, and maintain inner balance.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner edge of the hind hoof, travels up the inside of the hind limb, across the belly, and ends at the side of the chest near the ribs.  
This ascending flow supports digestion, muscle tone, and the transformation of food into usable energy.  

###Function###  
Physically, it manages digestion, nutrient absorption, blood formation, and muscle strength.  
It supports balance, focus, and the coordination of movement.  
Energetically, it governs thought, concentration, and the capacity for empathy and stability.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Poor appetite, weakness, muscle fatigue, swelling of limbs, or digestive disorders.  
Energetically, worry, overthinking, or lack of grounding.  
The horse may appear lethargic, unbalanced, or emotionally unsettled.

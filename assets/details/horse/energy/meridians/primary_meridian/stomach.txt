#Stomach Meridian (Wei Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Stomach Meridian** governs **digestion, nourishment, and the transformation of food into energy**.  
It represents how experiences are processed — both physically and emotionally — and the ability to feel content and grounded.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the eye, travels down along the face, through the neck and chest, across the abdomen, and continues along the front of the hind limb to end at the outer front edge of the hind hoof.  
This descending pathway reflects the process of taking in, digesting, and releasing.  

###Function###  
Physically, it manages the stomach and digestive organs, ensuring proper breakdown and absorption of nutrients.  
It supports the muscles, limbs, and vitality through nourishment.  
Energetically, it influences satisfaction, patience, and the horse’s relationship with the environment.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Colic, bloating, poor appetite, or stiffness along the stomach channel.  
Energetically, worry, anxiety, or excessive sensitivity to routine changes.  
The horse may show digestive upset or restlessness during feeding.

#Small Intestine Meridian (Xiao Chang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Small Intestine Meridian** governs **assimilation, clarity, and discernment**.  
It represents the ability to separate the pure from the impure — both in digestion and in life experiences.

Begins at the outer edge of the fore hoof, travels up along the back of the forelimb, crosses the shoulder and neck, and ends near the ear.

###Function###  
Physically, it governs digestion and nutrient absorption, ensuring that nourishment is distributed effectively.  
It supports the heart by clarifying and refining both physical and emotional input.  
Energetically, it helps discern truth, guiding decisions with intuition and inner wisdom.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Digestive upset, shoulder stiffness, or ear sensitivity.

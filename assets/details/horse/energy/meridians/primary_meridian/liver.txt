#Liver Meridian (Gan Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Liver Meridian** governs **smooth flow of Qi, emotional balance, and muscular coordination**.  
It represents vision, direction, and the ability to move forward with purpose and adaptability.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner edge of the hind hoof, travels up the inside of the hind limb, passes through the abdomen and chest, and ends near the eye.  
This ascending and central pathway reflects the steady rise of life energy and emotional harmony.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates blood flow, supports tendons, ligaments, and reproductive health.  
It stores blood during rest and distributes it during activity.  
Energetically, it governs planning, creativity, and the ability to move fluidly through challenges.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Muscle stiffness, eye issues, hormonal imbalance, or irritability.  
Energetically, frustration, anger, or suppressed emotion.  
The horse may resist bending, feel tense in movement, or show mood swings.

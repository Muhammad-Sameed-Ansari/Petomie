#Large Intestine Meridian (Da Chang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Large Intestine Meridian** governs **elimination, purification, and the ability to let go**.  
It represents the process of releasing what no longer serves — both physically and emotionally — restoring clarity and balance.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer corner of the nostril, travels up along the face to the jaw, crosses over the shoulder, runs down the front of the forelimb, and ends at the outer edge of the fore hoof.  
This outward and downward pathway symbolizes clearing the old to make room for renewal.  

###Function###  
Physically, it controls bowel movements, waste elimination, and moisture balance in the body.  
It influences the skin, nose, and mucous membranes.  
Energetically, it assists in emotional release, decision-making, and moving forward without attachment.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Constipation, diarrhea, nasal discharge, or stiffness in the shoulder or forelimb.  
Energetically, resistance to change, irritability, or holding on to the past.  
The horse may appear tense, defensive, or unsettled.

#Bladder Meridian#

##Location##
Begins at the medial canthus of the eye (BL-1), just above the inner corner, and ascends over the poll between the ears.
From there, it travels down the neck alongside the mane and continues along the back near the topline, forming two parallel Bladder lines:
###Inner line###
Runs close to the spine and contains the Back-Shu points, which correspond to the internal organs.
###Outer line###
Runs lateral to the inner line, approximately a hand’s width further out.

Both lines continue along the withers, back, and croup. From the sacral area, the meridian descends through the groove between the hamstring muscles (the “poverty groove”) on the lateral side of the hindquarters.
It passes down the back of the hind limb, behind the hock, along the lateral side of the cannon bone, over the fetlock and pastern, and ends at the lateral corner of the hind hoof’s coronary band (BL-67).

##Shape##
A long, paired, bilateral meridian running from the head to the hind hoof along both sides of the body.
It follows the spine closely, dividing into two branches over the back and then descending along the hind limbs.
The meridian is the longest in the body and connects externally with the skin, fascia, and muscles of the back and internally with the bladder and kidney systems.

##Function##
Regulates the flow and storage of fluids through the bladder and urinary system
Clears toxins and supports the elimination of waste
Balances the autonomic nervous system and relaxes the body
Connects to the back, spine, and hindquarters to release tension
Harmonizes the relationship between the exterior (Wei Qi) and interior (Yin organs)
Influences the entire musculoskeletal system and emotional resilience

##Signs of Imbalance##
Tightness, pain, or sensitivity along the back or hamstrings
Urinary issues such as retention, frequency, or incontinence
Restlessness, nervousness, or hypersensitivity to touch
Fatigue, stiffness, or reduced performance
Muscle soreness after exercise or difficulty stretching
Emotional tension, fear, or inability to relax

#Bladder Meridian (Pang Guang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Bladder Meridian** governs **fluid regulation, energy flow along the spine, and release**.  
It represents the ability to balance control and relaxation — storing and letting go at the right time.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner corner of the eye, travels over the head, runs down both sides of the spine, crosses over the hips, and continues along the back of the hind limb to end at the outer tip of the hind hoof.  
This long, descending pathway mirrors the flow of Qi through the body’s central axis, supporting balance, posture, and release of tension.  

###Function###  
Physically, it manages urination, fluid balance, and energy flow along the spinal column and nervous system.  
It interacts closely with the kidneys to maintain energy reserves.  
Energetically, it governs boundaries, strength, and the ability to release stored stress or emotion.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Back stiffness, urinary issues, or tension along the spine.  
Energetically, fear, rigidity, or difficulty relaxing.  
The horse may hold tension in the back or show defensive reactions to touch.

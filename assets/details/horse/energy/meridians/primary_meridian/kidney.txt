#Kidney Meridian (Shen Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Kidney Meridian** governs **vital essence, strength, reproduction, and longevity**.  
It represents the deep reserves of life energy — the root of vitality, courage, and willpower.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the center of the hind hoof, travels up the inner side of the hind limb, across the abdomen, through the chest, and ends near the wither close to the heart region.  
This ascending flow nourishes the body’s core, linking the foundation of life to the center of vitality.  

###Function###  
Physically, it controls growth, development, bone health, and reproductive functions.  
It supports the adrenal glands and fluid balance in cooperation with the bladder.  
Energetically, it governs fear, will, and endurance — the capacity to face challenges with calm strength.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Lower back pain, weak hindquarters, reproductive issues, or brittle hooves.  
Energetically, fearfulness, exhaustion, or lack of drive.  
The horse may appear timid or unwilling to move forward confidently.

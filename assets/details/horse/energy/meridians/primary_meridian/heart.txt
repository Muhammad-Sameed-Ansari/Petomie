#Heart Meridian (Xin Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as circulation, digestion, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Heart Meridian** governs **circulation, consciousness, and emotional expression**.  
It represents the center of being, the flame of spirit that illuminates awareness and connection.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins deep within the heart, emerges in the chest, travels to the shoulder, runs down the inside of the forelimb, and ends at the inner edge of the fore hoof.  
This inward and downward pathway links the heart to movement and touch, allowing emotion to flow into expression.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates the heartbeat, blood flow, and coordination of circulation with respiration.  
It influences sleep, mental clarity, and temperature balance.  
Energetically, it governs joy, connection, and authenticity — the horse’s ability to trust and engage openly.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Irregular heartbeat, restlessness, heat signs, or tension in the forelimb.  
Energetically, anxiety, lack of joy, or emotional disconnection.  
The horse may appear nervous, unsettled, or withdrawn.

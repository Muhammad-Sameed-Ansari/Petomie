#Lung Meridian#

##Location##
Begins in the chest region near the first rib, connecting internally with the lungs and throat before emerging on the surface at the muscular depression just in front of the shoulder (LU-1).
From there, it travels along the medial side of the forelimb, passing through the groove between the biceps brachii and triceps muscles.
It continues distally along the craniomedial aspect of the forearm, crossing the medial side of the carpus and metacarpus, and ends at the medial side of the front hoof, at the caudal edge of the coronet of the first digit (LU-11).

##Shape##
A single, superficial meridian line running from the chest down the medial (inner) forelimb to the front hoof.
Closely follows the path of major vessels and muscles associated with respiration and forelimb movement.

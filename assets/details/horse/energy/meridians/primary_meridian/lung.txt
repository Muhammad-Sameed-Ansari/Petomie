#Lung Meridian (Fei Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as breathing, digestion, and circulation, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Lung Meridian** governs **respiration, vitality, and the intake of life force**.  
It represents the connection between the outer world and inner self — the breath of life that initiates movement and balance.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins in the chest near the lungs, travels to the shoulder, runs down the front of the forelimb, and ends at the inside of the fore hoof.  
This downward flow connects breath to movement, grounding inspiration into action.  

###Function###  
Physically, it controls respiration, oxygen exchange, and immune defense.  
It influences the skin, body temperature, and overall vitality.  
Energetically, it governs openness, grief, and the ability to release the past and welcome renewal.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Coughing, breathing difficulties, tight shoulders, or skin irritations.  
Energetically, sadness, withdrawal, or holding on to loss may appear.  
Horses may seem less expressive or lack vitality.

#Large Intestine Meridian#

##Location##
Begins at the medial corner of the front hoof (LI-1), on the radial side of the second digit.
Ascends the cranial and dorsolateral aspect of the pastern and metacarpus, traveling up the forelimb over the extensor muscles.
Continues along the craniolateral surface of the forearm and upper arm to the shoulder point, passing in front of the shoulder joint.
From there, it runs over the lateral neck toward the lower jaw and cheek area, crossing the face below the eye, and ends just beside the nostril at the junction of the upper and lower lips (LI-20).

##Shape##
A long, superficial meridian line extending from the front hoof to the nostril.
Travels along the craniolateral surface of the forelimb and up to the head, mirroring the path of the Lung Meridian on the opposite limb.

##Function##
Regulates large intestine function and assists elimination of waste
Balances the paired Lung Meridian and supports overall energy flow through the forelimbs
Clears heat and inflammation from the body

Supports immune defense and harmonizes internal–external balance

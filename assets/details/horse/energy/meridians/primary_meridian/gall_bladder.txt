#Gallbladder Meridian (Dan Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the foundation through which **Qi (vital life force)** circulates, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the horse’s body.  
Each meridian is linked to a **Yin or Yang organ**, representing the continuous balance between nourishment and activity, stillness and movement, inner calm and outward strength.  
In horses, these meridians guide both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** like awareness, intuition, and vitality.  
Together, they maintain harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the horse to move freely and live with natural rhythm and grace.  

The **Gallbladder Meridian** governs **decision, direction, and courage in action**.  
It represents clear movement and the ability to act with precision and confidence.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the outer corner of the eye, travels over the head, down the side of the neck and body, over the ribs and hips, and continues along the outer hind limb to end at the tip of the hind hoof.  
This flowing lateral pathway mirrors balance in motion and supports coordination and flexibility.  

###Function###  
Physically, it aids digestion, bile secretion, and muscle coordination.  
It assists the liver in regulating energy flow and supports joint health.  
Energetically, it governs decision-making, assertiveness, and alignment of thought with movement.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness along the sides, joint pain, or imbalance in coordination.  
Energetically, indecision, frustration, or irritability.  
The horse may appear tense, reactive, or hesitant in movement.

#Penetrating Vessel (Chong Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Penetrating Vessel** governs the **core energy, blood flow, and life force of the body**.  
It represents the deep well of vitality that nourishes all meridians and supports reproduction, growth, and emotional stability.  
It embodies grounding, resilience, and the inner pulse of life.

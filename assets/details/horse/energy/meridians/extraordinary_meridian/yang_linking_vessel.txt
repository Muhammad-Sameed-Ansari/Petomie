#Yang Linking Vessel (Yang Wei Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Yang Wei Mai**, also called the **Yang Linking Vessel**, governs **coordination, adaptability, and outward harmony**.  
It connects the Yang meridians, balancing the external body with action and alertness.  
It represents rhythm, resilience, and the ability to flow with life’s movement.

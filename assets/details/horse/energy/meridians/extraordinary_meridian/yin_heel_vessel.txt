#Yin Heel Vessel (Yin Qiao Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Yin Qiao Mai**, also called the **Yin Heel Vessel**, governs **balance, posture, and the ability to stand with inner stillness**.  
It represents receptivity, emotional grounding, and the calm strength that arises from within.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner hind hoof, travels up the inner side of the hind limb, passes through the abdomen and chest, and ends near the inner corner of the eye.  
This vertical pathway connects the legs to the eyes, linking physical grounding with emotional awareness.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates muscle tone of the inner limbs, supports standing balance, and coordinates flexion and extension.  
It influences rest, sleep cycles, and the ability to remain centered.  
Energetically, it embodies introspection, calm awareness, and the quiet strength of Yin energy.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness or weakness in the inner hind limbs, imbalance when standing, or uneven posture.  
Energetically, emotional withdrawal, over-sensitivity, or inner restlessness.  
The horse may seem easily startled, unsteady, or reluctant to relax.

#Yang Heel Vessel (Yang Qiao Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Yang Qiao Mai**, also called the **Yang Heel Vessel**, governs **movement, agility, and alertness**.  
It represents outward action, awareness, and readiness to respond to the environment with strength and coordination.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer hind hoof, travels up the outer side of the hind limb, passes over the hip and flank, ascends the back and neck, and ends near the outer corner of the eye.  
This rising and outward path supports dynamic motion and the ability to act with confidence.  

###Function###  
Physically, it controls the muscles of the outer limbs, coordinates flexibility, and regulates balance during movement.  
It influences alertness, eye movement, and responsiveness.  
Energetically, it governs awareness, confidence, and the expression of Yang energy through motion.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension in the outer limbs, stiffness in the back or hips, or imbalance during motion.  
Energetically, over-alertness, nervousness, or restlessness.  
The horse may appear reactive, over-energized, or unable to settle.

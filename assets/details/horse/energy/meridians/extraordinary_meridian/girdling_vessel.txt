#Girdling Vessel (Dai Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Girdling Vessel** encircles the body like a belt and governs **stability, coordination, and integration of movement**.  
It represents the ability to maintain balance and unity between upper and lower, left and right sides of the body.  
It embodies centeredness, self-control, and rhythm.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Encircles the body horizontally at the level of the abdomen and lower ribs, connecting the front, sides, and back.  
This circular pathway harmonizes vertical energy flows, ensuring balance and coordination.  

###Function###  
Physically, it stabilizes the spine, hips, and abdomen, coordinating the actions of the limbs.  
It influences muscle tone, flexibility, and overall posture.  
Energetically, it governs balance, harmony, and adaptability — keeping the horse grounded and integrated in movement.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak topline, uneven gait, stiffness in the back or hips, or imbalance in movement.  
Energetically, loss of focus, overextension, or scattered energy.  
The horse may appear unstable, restless, or tense when asked to bend or collect.

#Governing Vessel (Du Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Governing Vessel** represents the **Yang aspect** of the body and runs along the midline of the back.  
It connects and nourishes all Yang meridians, governing vitality, strength, and outward expression.  
It embodies leadership, confidence, and the power of direction.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the hind hoof, travels upward along the midline of the body, passes over the tail and spine, along the neck, over the head, and ends at the upper lip.  
This ascending pathway mirrors the rise of vitality, connecting the root of power to the crown of awareness.  

###Function###  
Physically, it controls the spinal cord, brain, and muscular coordination.  
It strengthens posture, balance, and the nervous system.  
Energetically, it empowers confidence, resilience, and direction — guiding life force upward through the body’s core.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Back pain, spinal tension, loss of coordination, or weakness in the hindquarters.  
Energetically, insecurity, lack of motivation, or difficulty maintaining focus.

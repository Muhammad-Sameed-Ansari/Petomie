#Conception Vessel (Ren Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that supports emotional grounding, vitality, and centered awareness.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and strengthening the horse’s connection to its core essence.

The **Conception Vessel** runs along the midline of the underside of the body and governs **nourishment, fertility, emotional grounding, and the regulation of Yin energy**.  
It represents receptivity, inner balance, restoration, and the ability to replenish life force.

###Shape and Pathway###  
Runs along the ventral midline from the perineum to the lower lip.  
This upward-flowing pathway nourishes Yin, regulates reproductive and digestive function, and stabilizes emotional and energetic centers.

###Function###  
Physically, it supports reproductive organs, digestion, immune function, and the regulation of body fluids.  
It influences fertility, hormonal balance, and tissue nourishment.  
Energetically, it governs grounding, emotional stability, and the restoration of life force — helping the horse feel safe, supported, and centered.

###Common Imbalances###  
Reproductive issues, digestive weakness, lowered immunity, or tension along the underside of the body.  
Energetically, emotional sensitivity, insecurity, depletion, or difficulty grounding.  
The horse may appear withdrawn, anxious, or easily overwhelmed.

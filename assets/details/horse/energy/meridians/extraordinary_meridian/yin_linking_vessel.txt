# Yin Linking Vessel (Yin Wei Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They serve as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In horses, they represent the profound energetic framework that connects the body’s central axis with emotional, mental, and spiritual equilibrium.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel influences groups of meridians, maintaining harmony between Yin and Yang and ensuring internal stability during change.  

The **Yin Wei Mai**, also called the **Yin Linking Vessel**, governs **emotional depth, inner harmony, and integration of experiences**.  
It connects the Yin meridians and nurtures the ability to process feelings with calm awareness and understanding.

#Yin–Yang Balance#

##Location##
Present throughout the entire body — within every organ, tissue, and energy channel.
Yin and Yang exist as complementary forces that shape all physiological and energetic processes:

###Yin###
The inner, cooling, nourishing, and stabilizing quality.

###Yang###
The outer, warming, active, and expressive quality.
In the horse’s body, Yin governs the fluids, blood, rest, and structure, while Yang governs movement, temperature, and functional activity.

##Shape##
Not a single structure, but a dynamic polarity expressed through:
###Organs###
Liver (Yin) balancing Gall Bladder (Yang), Heart (Yin) balancing Small Intestine (Yang), etc.
###Meridians###
Each Yin channel is paired with a Yang channel along the limbs and trunk.
###Body expression###
Yin seen in the calm, grounded, inward nature.
Yang seen in vitality, alertness, and motion.
The two flow cyclically — Yin transforms into Yang (rest → movement), and Yang returns to Yin (activity → recovery).

##Function##
Maintains internal harmony and regulates the horse’s vitality, body temperature, and mood.
Balances activity and rest, muscle tone and relaxation, digestion and elimination, and energy and calmness.
When Yin is deficient, the horse may show signs like restlessness, overheating, or dryness.
When Yang is deficient, signs may include fatigue, cold limbs, or lack of drive.
True health arises when Yin and Yang continuously interact, transform, and support each other in rhythm with nature’s cycles — day and night, movement and stillness, summer and winter.

#Manus#

##Location##
The manus, or forefoot, of the horse is the distal region of the forelimb, located below the carpus (knee) and extending to the hoof.
It includes the metacarpal bones, phalanges, and associated sesamoid bones that make up the lower limb and hoof structures.

##Shape##
Elongated and specialized for supporting weight and absorbing shock.
The horse has only one functional digit (digit III), corresponding to the middle finger in humans.
The surrounding structures form a single strong column from the cannon bone to the hoof.

##Main Bones##
- **Metacarpal III (Cannon Bone):** The main weight-bearing bone of the manus.
- **Metacarpal II and IV (Splint Bones):** Small, slender bones on either side of the cannon; provide lateral support.
- **Proximal Phalanx (P1 / Long Pastern Bone):** Connects the fetlock joint to the short pastern.
- **Middle Phalanx (P2 / Short Pastern Bone):** Between the long pastern and coffin bone.
- **Distal Phalanx (P3 / Coffin Bone):** Enclosed within the hoof capsule; forms the internal structure of the hoof.
- **Proximal Sesamoids (2):** Located at the back of the fetlock joint; serve as pulleys for tendons.
- **Distal Sesamoid (Navicular Bone):** Found beneath the coffin joint; reduces friction during tendon movement.

##Function##
- Supports and bears the entire body weight during stance and motion.
- Provides shock absorption through the joints, tendons, and hoof structures.
- Enables propulsion by transforming muscular energy into forward movement.
- Maintains stability and balance while allowing elastic recoil during gait.

#Shoulder#

##Location##
The shoulder of the horse is located at the junction between the neck and the forelimb.
It includes the scapular region, connecting the trunk to the forelimb through muscular attachments rather than a bony joint.
The shoulder extends from the withers and lateral thorax to the humerus.

##Shape##
A broad, muscular region covering the scapula (shoulder blade), which lies against the thoracic wall.
The scapula is flat and triangular with a prominent spine and cartilage at its dorsal border.
The shoulder has no clavicle, allowing great mobility and shock absorption during locomotion.

##Main Bones##
- **Scapula:** Large, flat bone forming the main structure of the shoulder; articulates distally with the humerus at the shoulder joint.
- **Humerus (Proximal End):** Forms the lower part of the shoulder joint, articulating with the glenoid cavity of the scapula.

##Main Muscles##
- **Supraspinatus:** Located cranial to the scapular spine; extends and stabilizes the shoulder joint.
- **Infraspinatus:** Lies caudal to the scapular spine; acts as an abductor and stabilizer of the shoulder.
- **Deltoideus:** Thick muscle covering the lateral scapula; flexes the shoulder joint.
- **Subscapularis:** On the medial surface of the scapula; adducts and stabilizes the shoulder.
- **Teres Major:** Caudomedial to the shoulder; flexes and medially rotates the shoulder.
- **Teres Minor:** Small muscle lateral to the infraspinatus; assists in flexion and abduction of the shoulder.
- **Trapezius (Cervical & Thoracic Parts):** Elevates and rotates the scapula, assisting limb protraction and retraction.
- **Rhomboideus:** Lies deep to the trapezius; elevates the scapula and supports the forelimb.
- **Serratus Ventralis:** Large fan-shaped muscle suspending the trunk between the forelimbs; supports and stabilizes the shoulder girdle.

##Function##
- Supports and connects the forelimb to the trunk without a bony attachment.
- Absorbs shock during locomotion and stabilizes the upper limb.
- Allows forward and backward movement of the scapula for stride length and flexibility.
- Provides muscle leverage for forelimb movement, elevation, and protraction.

#Antebrachium#

##Location##
The antebrachium, or forearm, of the horse lies between the elbow joint and the carpus (knee).
It connects the brachium (upper arm) to the manus (forefoot) and forms the middle section of the forelimb.

##Shape##
Composed primarily of two long bones—the radius and the ulna—surrounded by strong muscles and tendons.
The radius is the major weight-bearing bone, while the ulna is reduced and partially fused to the radius.
The antebrachium tapers distally toward the carpus, giving the forelimb its characteristic elongated shape.

##Main Bones##
- **Radius:** The main bone of the forearm; broad proximally and tapering distally; articulates with the humerus above and the carpus below.
- **Ulna:** Reduced and fused to the radius except proximally; forms the olecranon process, which serves as the point of the elbow.

##Main Muscles##
- **Extensor Carpi Radialis:** Runs along the cranial aspect; extends the carpus.
- **Common Digital Extensor:** Lies lateral to the extensor carpi radialis; extends the digit.
- **Lateral Digital Extensor:** Extends the lateral side of the digit; assists with stabilization during extension.
- **Flexor Carpi Radialis:** Located on the medial side; flexes the carpus.
- **Flexor Carpi Ulnaris:** Found on the caudal side; flexes the carpus and supports the limb during stance.
- **Superficial Digital Flexor:** Runs along the caudomedial surface; flexes the digit and carpus.
- **Deep Digital Flexor:** Lies beneath the superficial flexor; provides primary flexion of the digit.
- **Ulnaris Lateralis (Extensor Carpi Ulnaris):** Functions as both flexor and extensor of the carpus depending on limb position.

##Function##
- Supports and stabilizes the forelimb during movement and weight-bearing.
- Facilitates flexion and extension of the carpus and digit.
- Acts as a lever for propulsion and shock absorption.
- Provides attachment for major tendons that transmit muscular force to the lower limb.

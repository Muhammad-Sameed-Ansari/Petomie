#Brachium#

##Location##
The brachium, or upper arm, of the horse is the region between the shoulder joint and the elbow joint.
It connects the scapula to the radius and ulna and forms the upper portion of the forelimb between the scapular and antebrachial regions.

##Shape##
Contains a single large bone, the humerus, which is enveloped by powerful muscles responsible for flexion and extension of the shoulder and elbow joints.
These muscles are arranged around the humerus as cranial, caudal, and medial groups.

##Main Muscles##
- Biceps Brachii: Large, fusiform muscle located on the cranial surface; flexes the elbow and extends the shoulder, playing a role in the stay apparatus.
- Brachialis: Lies on the lateral aspect of the humerus; assists in flexion of the elbow joint.
- Triceps Brachii (long, lateral, and medial heads): Occupies the caudal region; the main extensor of the elbow and supports weight-bearing during stance.
- Tensor Fasciae Antebrachii: Lies over the triceps medially; extends the elbow and tenses the antebrachial fascia.
- Deltoideus: Thick, triangular muscle on the lateral shoulder; flexes the shoulder joint.
- Teres Major: Located caudomedially to the shoulder joint; flexes and medially rotates the shoulder.
- Coracobrachialis: Small, elongated muscle on the medial aspect of the shoulder; stabilizes the shoulder joint during movement.

##Function##
- Provides powerful movement for flexion and extension of the shoulder and elbow joints.
- Supports the weight of the trunk through the forelimb during locomotion.
- Maintains limb stability during the stance phase and contributes to propulsion.
- Assists in the horse’s stay apparatus by locking the elbow and shoulder joints for standing rest.

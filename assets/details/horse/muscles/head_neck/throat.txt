#Throat Muscles#

The horse’s throat muscles surround the larynx and pharynx, coordinating swallowing, breathing, and vocalization.  
They ensure smooth passage of air and food while maintaining balance between expression and protection.  
Energetically, they represent truth, communication, and the freedom to express without fear.

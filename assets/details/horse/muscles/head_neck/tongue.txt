#Tongue Muscles#

The horse’s tongue muscles form a complex structure of **intrinsic and extrinsic fibers** that control shape, tone, and movement within the oral cavity.  
They play an essential role in **chewing, swallowing, and vocalization**, as well as balance and proprioception through the hyoid connection.  
Energetically, the tongue represents **expression, truth, and the bridge between nourishment and communication**.

#Mastication#

##Location##
Muscles of mastication are located on the sides of the face and skull, surrounding the mandible, zygomatic arch, and temporal region. They connect the lower jaw to the skull and are highly developed in the horse due to the grinding motion required for fibrous feed.

##Shape##
Composed of large, powerful paired muscles including the masseter, temporalis, and pterygoid muscles. The masseter is thick and rectangular along the jaw angle, the temporalis is fan-shaped on the temporal fossa, and the pterygoids are deep and rounded within the pterygoid fossa.

##Function##
Enable chewing and grinding of food through elevation, depression, and lateral movement of the mandible
Provide strong bite force to break down coarse plant material
Assist in stabilizing the temporomandibular joint during mastication
Coordinate with tongue and cheek muscles for efficient feed processing

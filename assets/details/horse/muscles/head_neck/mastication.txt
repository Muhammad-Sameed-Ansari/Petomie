#Mastication Muscles#

##Location##
Located around the **jaw, cheeks, and temporal region**, connecting the **mandible to the skull**.  
They are responsible for **chewing, grinding, and jaw stabilization** during feeding.

##Shape##
Composed of **large, strong, and layered muscles** adapted for side-to-side grinding motions typical of herbivores.

##Parts##

###1. Masseter###
Large muscle on the cheek’s lateral surface.  
- Origin: zygomatic arch  
- Insertion: lateral mandible  
- **Function:** Closes jaw, moves it side-to-side, and provides chewing force  

###2. Temporalis###
Covers the temporal region.  
- Origin: temporal fossa  
- Insertion: coronoid process of mandible  
- **Function:** Elevates and retracts the jaw  

###3. Medial Pterygoid###
Inside the mandible.  
- Origin: pterygoid fossa  
- Insertion: medial mandible  
- **Function:** Elevates and moves jaw laterally  

###4. Lateral Pterygoid###
Deep, small muscle.  
- Origin: sphenoid bone  
- Insertion: mandibular neck and joint capsule  
- **Function:** Moves jaw forward and side-to-side  

###5. Digastricus###
Located ventrally along the jaw.  
- Origin: occipital region  
- Insertion: mandible  
- **Function:** Opens mouth by lowering mandible  

##Function##
- Performs **grinding and chewing motions** for plant material  
- Controls **jaw elevation, depression, and lateral movement**  
- Maintains **jaw stability during chewing**  
- Coordinates with **tongue and facial muscles** for effective feeding

#Neck Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the **cervical region**, extending from the **head to the shoulders and thorax**.  
These muscles form the upper and lateral contours of the neck and are crucial for **posture, balance, and head control**.

##Shape##
Composed of **large, powerful, and layered muscles** arranged both superficially and deeply.  
They provide strength, flexibility, and stability for the long and heavy equine neck.

##Parts##

###1. Brachiocephalicus###
Long muscle from the head and neck to the humerus.  
- Pulls the forelimb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally when one side contracts

###2. Sternocephalicus###
From the sternum to the head.  
- Flexes the head and neck  
- Assists in turning the head

###3. Splenius###
Broad muscle covering the upper neck.  
- Elevates and extends the head and neck  
- Aids in lateral bending

###4. Semispinalis Capitis###
Deep dorsal muscle from upper thoracic vertebrae to skull.  
- Extends and stabilizes the neck  
- Raises the head

###5. Longus Colli###
Deep ventral muscle along the cervical vertebrae.  
- Flexes the neck downward  
- Stabilizes the cervical spine

###6. Trapezius (Cervical Part)###
Superficial triangular sheet on the neck side.  
- Elevates and advances the scapula  
- Assists forelimb movement

###7. Rhomboideus###
Deep to trapezius, connecting neck vertebrae to scapula.  
- Elevates and stabilizes the scapula

###8. Omotransversarius###
Narrow band from atlas to shoulder.  
- Pulls limb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally

###9. Serratus Ventralis (Cervical Part)###
Fan-shaped muscle connecting cervical vertebrae to scapula.  
- Supports the trunk between forelimbs  
- Raises the neck and stabilizes the shoulder

###10. Nuchal Ligament###
Strong elastic ligament from skull to withers.  
- Supports the head’s weight  
- Enables passive neck elevation

##Function##
- Controls **head and neck motion**  
- Maintains **balance and posture**  
- Supports **forelimb coordination**  
- Provides **flexion, extension, and lateral bending** of the neck

#Neck Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the **cervical region** between the head, thorax, and shoulders.  
These muscles form the upper, lower, and lateral contours of the neck and play vital roles in **head and neck movement, posture, and balance**.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, strong, and layered muscles** arranged both superficially and deeply.  
They vary from broad, sheet-like structures to narrow strap-like bands, providing both **flexibility and strength** for the heavy equine neck.

##Parts##

###1. Brachiocephalicus###
Long, strap-like muscle running from the head and neck to the humerus.  
- Extends the shoulder joint  
- Pulls the forelimb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally when acting unilaterally  

###2. Sternocephalicus###
Runs from the sternum to the head.  
- Flexes the head and neck  
- Aids in turning the head to one side  

###3. Splenius###
Broad, flat muscle on the dorsal neck surface beneath the trapezius.  
- Extends and raises the head and neck  
- Acts bilaterally for extension; unilaterally for lateral flexion  

###4. Semispinalis Capitis###
Large, deep dorsal muscle running from the upper thoracic vertebrae to the skull.  
- Elevates and extends the head  
- Stabilizes the neck during motion  

###5. Longus Colli###
Deep ventral muscle lying along the cervical vertebrae.  
- Flexes the neck ventrally  
- Stabilizes the cervical spine during head movement  

###6. Trapezius (Cervical Part)###
Thin, triangular sheet covering the side of the neck.  
- Elevates and advances the scapula  
- Assists in forelimb protraction  

###7. Rhomboideus###
Deep to the trapezius, extending from the cervical vertebrae to the scapula.  
- Elevates the scapula  
- Pulls it forward and upward  

###8. Omotransversarius###
Narrow band running from the atlas to the shoulder region.  
- Advances the limb  
- Flexes the neck laterally  

###9. Serratus Ventralis (Cervical Part)###
Fan-shaped muscle connecting the cervical vertebrae to the scapula.  
- Supports the trunk  
- Assists in raising the neck and stabilizing the shoulder  

###10. Nuchal Ligament (Associated Structure)###
Strong elastic ligament running from the occipital bone to the withers.  
- Supports the head’s weight  
- Allows passive elevation of the neck with minimal muscular effort  

##Function##
- Control **head and neck movement** for grazing, communication, and balance  
- Maintain **posture and flexibility** of the cervical spine  
- Support **forelimb motion** and stabilization during locomotion  
- Assist in **head elevation, flexion, and lateral bending**  
- Distribute and absorb forces during movement and impact

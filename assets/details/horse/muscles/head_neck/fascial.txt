#Facial Expression Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **head region**, surrounding the eyes, lips, nostrils, and ears.  
These muscles are arranged superficially beneath the skin of the face and are primarily attached to the facial bones and skin rather than to other muscles.  
They are innervated by branches of the **facial nerve (cranial nerve VII)**.

##Shape##
Thin, flat, and highly elastic muscles that interlace with connective tissue and the skin.  
They vary in size and direction, forming a complex network that allows **fine, precise movements** of facial structures for expression, communication, and sensory control.

##Parts##

###1. Levator Nasolabialis###
- Runs along the face from the nasal bone toward the upper lip and nostril.  
- Elevates the upper lip and dilates the nostrils.  

###2. Caninus###
- Lies along the lateral aspect of the muzzle.  
- Retracts the upper lip and helps dilate the nostril.  

###3. Zygomaticus###
- Extends from the facial crest to the mouth corner.  
- Retracts the commissure (corner) of the lips.  

###4. Buccinator###
- Broad muscle of the cheek, lying between the maxilla and mandible.  
- Compresses the cheek during chewing, keeping food between the teeth.  

###5. Orbicularis Oris###
- Circular muscle surrounding the lips.  
- Closes and puckers the mouth.  

###6. Levator Labii Superioris###
- Long, thin muscle running along the face and nose.  
- Elevates the upper lip, assisting in “flehmen” response.  

###7. Depressor Labii Inferioris###
- Found on the lateral aspect of the lower jaw.  
- Lowers the lower lip.  

###8. Orbicularis Oculi###
- Circular muscle surrounding the eye.  
- Closes the eyelids and protects the eye.  

###9. Frontoscutularis & Auricular Muscles###
- Surround the base of the ears.  
- Move and rotate the ears to detect sound direction and express mood.  

###10. Mentalis###
- Located on the chin.  
- Elevates and wrinkles the skin of the chin, controlling lower lip movement.  

##Function##
- Control **facial expressions** used in communication, such as ear position, nostril flare, and lip tension.  
- Facilitate **feeding and drinking** by manipulating lips and cheeks.  
- Protect the eyes through **blinking and squinting**.  
- Aid in **breathing regulation** via nostril dilation.  
- Support **social signaling and sensory awareness**, essential in equine body language and interaction.

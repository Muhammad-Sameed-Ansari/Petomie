#Facial Expression Muscles#

The horse’s facial muscles control subtle movements of the lips, nostrils, eyelids, and ears.  
They allow expression, communication, and sensory awareness, helping horses convey mood and emotion.  
Energetically, they represent communication, sensitivity, and emotional connection.

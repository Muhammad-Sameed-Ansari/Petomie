#Abdominal Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the **ventral and lateral walls of the abdomen**, extending from the **ribs and sternum** to the **pelvis**.  
These muscles form the main support structure of the abdominal cavity, enclosing the internal organs and aiding in respiration, posture, and movement.

##Shape##
Composed of **broad, flat muscle sheets** arranged in multiple layers, with fibers running in different directions.  
This arrangement provides strength, flexibility, and efficient compression of the abdominal wall.  
The muscles form the ventral body wall and contribute to trunk stability and core strength during locomotion.

##Parts##

###1. External Abdominal Oblique###
- Outermost and largest abdominal muscle.  
- Fibers run caudoventrally from the ribs and thoracolumbar fascia to the linea alba and tuber coxae.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdominal contents, flexes the trunk, supports viscera, and assists in forced expiration.  

###2. Internal Abdominal Oblique###
- Lies deep to the external oblique.  
- Fibers run cranioventrally from the tuber coxae and thoracolumbar fascia to the linea alba.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdomen, supports abdominal viscera, and assists in flexion and lateral bending of the trunk.  

###3. Transversus Abdominis###
- Deepest abdominal layer.  
- Fibers run transversely from the lumbar vertebrae and costal cartilages to the linea alba.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdominal organs, stabilizes the spine, and regulates intra-abdominal pressure.  

###4. Rectus Abdominis###
- Long, paired muscle running along the ventral midline.  
- Origin: sternum and costal cartilages.  
- Insertion: prepubic tendon at the cranial pubis.  
- **Function:** Flexes the trunk, supports abdominal wall, and stabilizes the pelvis during movement.  

###5. Linea Alba###
- Fibrous midline seam connecting left and right abdominal muscles.  
- Extends from xiphoid cartilage to pubic symphysis.  
- **Function:** Provides attachment and reinforcement for abdominal muscles; key surgical landmark.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Maintains abdominal organ position and supports the viscera.  
- **Compression:** Increases internal pressure for defecation, urination, and foaling.  
- **Flexion and posture:** Bends trunk and aids in rounding the back during collection.  
- **Respiration:** Works with diaphragm to assist expiration by compressing abdominal contents.  
- **Protection:** Shields internal organs and stabilizes the core during locomotion.

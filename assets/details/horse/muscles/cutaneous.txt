#Cutaneous#

The horse’s cutaneous muscles form a thin layer beneath the skin that allows subtle movements such as twitching to repel insects and express emotion.  
They cover large areas of the body, neck, and face, linking the surface of the skin with deeper structures.  
Energetically, they represent sensitivity, awareness, and the ability to react with grace and protection.

###Parts###

##Cutaneous Trunci##  
Covers most of the body trunk, responsible for twitching movements that shake off flies.  
Energetically, it symbolizes protective awareness and instinctive response.

##Cutaneous Colli##  
Located along the lower neck, aiding in skin movement and communication between neck and shoulder.  
Energetically, it represents fluid connection between thought and motion.

##Facial Subcutaneous Muscles##  
Thin muscles under the skin of the face, enabling expression, ear movement, and fine sensory reaction.  
Energetically, they embody communication, perception, and emotional expression.

###Function###  
The cutaneous muscles allow the horse to respond quickly to surface stimuli, such as touch or insects.  
They also assist in emotional and social expression through skin and facial movements.  
Energetically, they maintain protective awareness, bridging the physical and energetic boundaries of the horse’s body.

###Common Imbalances###  
Over‑reactivity: tension or hypersensitivity in the skin.  
Weak response: reduced awareness or fatigue.  
Asymmetrical twitching: imbalance in nervous or muscular tone.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect overstimulation, nervous strain, or lack of sensitivity and connection.

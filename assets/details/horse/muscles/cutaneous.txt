#Cutaneous Muscle#

##Location##
Located within the **superficial fascia** just beneath the skin, covering large areas of the neck, trunk, and limbs.  
Most developed over the **lateral surfaces of the thorax and abdomen**, extending toward the shoulder and thigh.  
In the horse, this muscle is especially thick along the sides of the body and less developed over the dorsal midline and limbs.

##Shape##
A **thin, sheet-like muscle** spread widely beneath the skin.  
Composed of fine muscle fibers interwoven with connective tissue, forming a continuous muscular layer attached loosely to the underlying fascia.  
It varies in thickness, being most prominent in the **cutaneous trunci region** and around the **neck and shoulder**.

##Parts##

###1. Cutaneous Trunci###
- The main and most extensive part of the cutaneous muscle.  
- Covers the sides of the thorax and abdomen.  
- Extends forward to the shoulder and backward toward the stifle region.  
- Attached to the fascia over the triceps and latissimus dorsi.  

###2. Cutaneous Colli###
- Found along the lower part of the neck.  
- Extends from the manubrium of the sternum upward and backward.  
- Thicker in males than females.  

###3. Cutaneous Omobrachialis###
- Small extension near the shoulder region.  
- Connects to the skin over the shoulder and upper forelimb.  

###4. Facial Cutaneous Areas###
- Includes smaller superficial muscle slips associated with facial expressions (around eyes, nostrils, lips, and ears).  
- Functionally linked with the facial expression muscles.  

##Function##
- Enables **skin twitching (panniculus reflex)** to remove flies and other irritants.  
- Assists in **thermoregulation** by increasing skin movement and airflow.  
- Enhances **sensitivity of the skin**, serving as a protective and sensory mechanism.  
- Works with **facial muscles** to control small skin movements for communication and tactile response.

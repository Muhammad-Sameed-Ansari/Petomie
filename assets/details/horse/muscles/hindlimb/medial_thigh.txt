#Medial Thigh Muscles#

The horse’s medial thigh muscles lie along the **inner surface of the hindlimb**, connecting the pelvis, femur, and tibia.  
They are responsible for **drawing the hindlimb inward**, **stabilizing the pelvis**, and **coordinating hip and stifle motion** during standing, walking, trotting, and cantering.  
These muscles provide both strength and control, supporting smooth transitions between propulsion and balance.  
Energetically, they represent **unity, grounding, and the balance between inner focus and outward motion**.

###Parts###

##Adductor Longus##  
A **long, narrow muscle** that extends from the **pubic bone** to the **femur**.  
It assists in **adduction of the limb** and **stabilization of the pelvis** during locomotion.  
Energetically, it represents **focused intention and inner centering**, guiding grounded movement.

##Adductor Brevis##  
A **short, deep muscle** lying between the adductor longus and magnus.  
Originates from the **pubic ramus** and inserts on the **proximal femur**, aiding fine adjustments of inward movement.  
It works to align the limb and maintain pelvic balance.  
Energetically, it reflects **integration and harmony**, uniting structure with flexibility.

##Adductor Magnus##  
A **broad, strong muscle** forming the deepest layer of the adductors.  
It arises from the **ischial tuberosity** and inserts along the **medial femur**.  
Provides major power for **adduction, hip extension, and weight transfer** during movement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **strength, stability, and resilience**, representing the foundation of physical and emotional grounding.

##Gracilis##  
A **flat, wide muscle** covering much of the inner thigh.  
It extends from the **pelvic symphysis** to the **tibia and fascia of the lower leg**.  
Assists in **adduction of the hindlimb**, **stifle flexion**, and **tarsal extension**.  
Essential for stability during stance and transitions between gaits.  
Energetically, it embodies **grace, flow, and inner strength**, aligning motion with balance and composure.

##Sartorius##  
A **long, strap-like muscle** crossing diagonally along the inner thigh.  
Originates at the **iliac crest** and attaches to the **medial tibia**.  
The cranial portion flexes the hip and extends the stifle, while the caudal portion flexes both joints simultaneously.  
Supports precise control during directional changes and collected movement.  
Energetically, it represents **adaptability and coordination**, guiding fluid, responsive transitions.

###Function###  
The medial thigh muscles work collectively to:  
- **Adduct the hindlimb**, pulling it toward the midline.  
- **Stabilize the pelvis** during stance and locomotion.  
- **Coordinate hip and stifle motion** for balanced propulsion.  
- **Distribute tension** evenly through the inner thigh and hindquarters.  
Energetically, they anchor **stability, grounded confidence, and smooth flow of energy through motion**.

###Common Imbalances###  
**Tightness:** restricted stride, inward rotation of the limb, or asymmetrical movement.  
**Weakness:** pelvic instability, loss of balance, or poor engagement of hindquarters.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **lack of grounding, overcontrol, or inner resistance to flow**.

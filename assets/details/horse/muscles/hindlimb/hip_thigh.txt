#Hip & Thigh Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the proximal part of the hindlimb, surrounding the pelvis and femur.  
These muscles generate the main propulsive power and stabilize the hip and stifle joints during locomotion.

##Shape##
Composed of large, powerful muscle groups that provide both strength and endurance.  
Include gluteal and hamstring muscles forming the bulk of the hindquarters.

##Parts##

###1. Gluteal Muscles (Superficial, Middle, Deep)###
- Located on the lateral surface of the pelvis.  
- Extend and abduct the hip.  
- Provide major propulsive force during locomotion.  

###2. Tensor Fasciae Latae###
- Triangular muscle on the lateral thigh.  
- Flexes the hip and tenses the fascia lata.  
- Assists in stifle extension.  

###3. Biceps Femoris###
- Large muscle covering the caudal and lateral thigh.  
- Extends the hip, stifle, and hock.  
- Flexes the stifle when limb is non-weight-bearing.  

###4. Semitendinosus###
- Caudal thigh muscle.  
- Extends hip and hock.  
- Flexes stifle.  

###5. Semimembranosus###
- Medial to semitendinosus.  
- Extends hip.  
- Flexes or extends stifle depending on limb position.  

###6. Gracilis###
- Medial flat muscle of thigh.  
- Adducts the limb and stabilizes the stifle.  

###7. Adductor###
- Large medial muscle group.  
- Adducts pelvic limb and supports stance.  

###8. Quadriceps Femoris###
- Four-part muscle group (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medialis, intermedius).  
- Main extensor of the stifle.  
- Crucial for weight-bearing and propulsion.  

##Function##
Provide propulsion, stabilize major joints, and generate forward thrust.  
Support balance and coordination during movement.

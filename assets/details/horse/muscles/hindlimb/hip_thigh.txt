#Hip and Thigh Muscles#

The horse’s hip and thigh muscles form the powerhouse of propulsion and support.  
They connect the pelvis to the hindlimb, providing drive, balance, and stability.  
Energetically, they represent strength, courage, and the power to move forward in life.

###Parts###

##Gluteal Muscles##  
Provide extension and strength for propulsion.  
Energetically, they symbolize empowerment and confident motion.

##Hamstring Group##  
Biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus flex the stifle and extend the hip.  
Energetically, they reflect endurance and flow of power.

##Quadriceps Femoris##  
Extends the stifle joint, stabilizing the hindlimb during standing and motion.  
Energetically, it represents stability and purposeful direction.

##Adductors##  
Draw the hindlimb inward for balance and coordination.  
Energetically, they embody harmony and centered grounding.

###Function###  
The hip and thigh muscles generate forward propulsion and provide strength for jumping, galloping, and collection.  
Energetically, they anchor the horse’s power, drive, and confidence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted stride or stiffness.  
Weakness: reduced push or instability.  
Soreness: overuse or strain from uneven work.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of motivation or suppressed energy flow.

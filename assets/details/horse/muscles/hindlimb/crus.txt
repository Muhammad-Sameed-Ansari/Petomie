#Crus Muscles#

##Location##
Situated in the middle section of the hindlimb between the stifle and hock, known as the gaskin region.  
These muscles control hock and stifle movement, acting as key flexors and extensors.

##Shape##
Long, spindle-shaped muscles grouped around the tibia and fibula.  
They vary in depth and strength, connecting to the tendons that continue into the pes.

##Parts##

###1. Gastrocnemius###
- Two-headed muscle forming the calf.  
- Extends the hock and flexes the stifle.  

###2. Soleus###
- Small, flat muscle beside gastrocnemius.  
- Assists in hock extension.  

###3. Superficial Digital Flexor###
- Lies over the gastrocnemius.  
- Flexes the stifle and digits; extends the hock.  

###4. Deep Digital Flexor###
- Deep to the superficial digital flexor.  
- Flexes digits and extends the hock.  

###5. Peroneus Tertius###
- Fibrous muscle on the cranial aspect of the crus.  
- Links movement of the hock and stifle; extends stifle = flexes hock.  

###6. Tibialis Cranialis###
- Located on the cranial aspect of the tibia.  
- Flexes the hock.  

###7. Long Digital Extensor###
- Runs along the front of the tibia to the digits.  
- Extends the digits and flexes the hock.  

###8. Lateral Digital Extensor###
- Narrow muscle lateral to the tibia.  
- Extends the outer digit and assists in hock flexion.  

##Function##
Coordinate stifle and hock motion, control limb flexion and extension, and assist in shock absorption.

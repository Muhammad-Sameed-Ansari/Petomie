#Crus Muscles#

The horse’s crus muscles, located between the stifle and hock, support flexion, extension, and stability of the lower hindlimb.  
They provide fine control of motion and balance during weight-bearing and propulsion.  
Energetically, they represent resilience, adaptability, and strength in transition.

###Parts###

##Gastrocnemius##  
Forms the calf, extending the hock and aiding propulsion.  
Energetically, it symbolizes strength and determination.

##Superficial Digital Flexor##  
Assists hock extension and fetlock flexion.  
Energetically, it reflects coordination and flexibility.

##Peroneus Tertius##  
Links hock and stifle movement for balance.  
Energetically, it represents connection and unity of motion.

##Tibialis Cranialis##  
Flexes the hock and aids agility.  
Energetically, it embodies lightness and responsiveness.

###Function###  
The crus muscles stabilize the hock and coordinate hindlimb flexion and extension.  
They maintain balance through powerful yet flexible movement.  
Energetically, they reflect steady flow, adaptability, and grounded confidence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tendon tension: restricted flexibility.  
Weakness: instability or poor propulsion.  
Soreness: overwork or fatigue.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect resistance to change or loss of grounded movement.

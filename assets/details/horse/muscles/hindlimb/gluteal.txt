#Gluteal Muscles#

The horse’s gluteal muscles are large, powerful muscles of the hindquarters.  
They provide propulsion, stability, and control of the hip joint.  
Energetically, they represent **drive, confidence, and power in forward movement**.

###Parts###

##Superficial Gluteal##  
Extends and abducts the hip.  
Energetically, symbolizes **freedom and joy in motion**.

##Middle Gluteal##  
Provides thrust and core strength for propulsion.  
Energetically, represents **ambition and physical expression**.

##Deep Gluteal##  
Stabilizes the hip and aids internal rotation.  
Energetically, reflects **inner control and rooted direction**.

###Function###  
These muscles power the hindlimb during locomotion and jumping.  
Energetically, they connect **physical strength with determination**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted stride or stiffness.  
Weakness: reduced propulsion.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **fear of moving forward or loss of motivation**.

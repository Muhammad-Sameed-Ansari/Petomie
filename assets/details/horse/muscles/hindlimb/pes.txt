#Pes Muscles#

##Location##
Located below the hock, forming the distal part of the hindlimb.  
These muscles and tendons control digital movement and stabilize the fetlock and pastern joints.

##Shape##
Consist mainly of long tendons extending from the crus, with smaller intrinsic muscles near the fetlock and pastern.  
Strong fibrous connections support the limb during motion and weight-bearing.

##Parts##

###1. Interosseus (Suspensory Ligament)###
- Modified muscle of the metatarsus.  
- Supports the fetlock joint and prevents overextension.  

###2. Extensor Branches###
- Continue from the interosseus to the extensor tendons.  
- Assist in fetlock stabilization during motion.  

###3. Flexor Tendons (Superficial & Deep Digital Flexors)###
- Continue from crus down to the pastern and coffin bone.  
- Flex the digits and support the distal limb during stance.  

###4. Common & Lateral Extensor Tendons###
- Extend the digits and stabilize the pastern.  

###5. Short Digital Extensors###
- Located on the dorsal aspect of the pastern.  
- Aid in extension and stability of the distal joints.  

##Function##
Support the limb during stance, control fine distal joint movements, and maintain fetlock and pastern alignment.

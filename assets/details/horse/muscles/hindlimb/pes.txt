#Pes Muscles#

The horse’s pes muscles, located in the distal hindlimb, control the fetlock, pastern, and hoof.  
They enable precise balance, weight absorption, and smooth energy transfer during motion.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, stability, and awareness of connection with the Earth.

###Parts###

##Digital Flexors##  
Flex the fetlock and pastern joints.  
Energetically, they symbolize flexibility and release.

##Digital Extensors##  
Lift the hoof and extend the lower joints.  
Energetically, they reflect readiness and awareness.

##Suspensory Ligament and Tendons##  
Support the limb and prevent overextension.  
Energetically, they embody protection and resilience.

##Interosseous Fibers##  
Provide fine control and feedback from the hoof.  
Energetically, they represent sensitivity and stability.

###Function###  
The pes muscles maintain limb stability, absorb impact, and coordinate precise movements of the hoof.  
Energetically, they ground the horse’s motion, balancing strength with sensitivity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: from impact or overuse.  
Tenderness: poor circulation or inflammation.  
Fatigue: repetitive stress or imbalance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of connection, fatigue, or instability in foundation.

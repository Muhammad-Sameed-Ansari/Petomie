#Back Muscles (Epaxial)#

##Location##
Located along the **dorsal aspect of the trunk**, extending from the **neck (cervical region)** to the **sacrum**.  
These muscles form the top line of the horse and connect the spine to the ribs, pelvis, and limbs.  
They lie above the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, functioning to **stabilize, extend, and flex** the vertebral column.

##Shape##
Composed of **large, layered, and longitudinal muscles**, both superficial and deep.  
The superficial layers form the visible contour of the back, while the deeper layers attach directly to the vertebrae.  
Their fibers run mainly parallel to the spine, providing strength and elasticity for posture and motion.

##Parts##

###1. Longissimus Dorsi###
- Largest and most powerful back muscle.  
- Extends from the sacrum and ilium to the neck.  
- Extends and laterally flexes the spine.  
- Stabilizes the back during locomotion and supports the rider’s weight.  

###2. Iliocostalis###
- Lies lateral to the longissimus.  
- Runs from the ilium to the ribs.  
- Extends and stabilizes the back and assists in side bending.  

###3. Spinalis et Multifidus###
- Deep layer close to the vertebral column.  
- Connects spinous and transverse processes.  
- Stabilizes individual vertebrae and maintains spinal alignment.  
- Provides fine control for balance and posture.  

###4. Serratus Dorsalis (Cranialis & Caudalis)###
- Thin muscles connected to ribs.  
- Assist in respiration: cranialis elevates ribs, caudalis depresses ribs.  
- Support trunk expansion and contraction during breathing.  

###5. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Broad, flat muscle on the side of the back.  
- Extends from thoracolumbar fascia to the humerus.  
- Draws the forelimb backward and flexes the shoulder.  

###6. Intertransversarii###
- Small deep muscles between transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae.  
- Provide stability and slight lateral movement.  

###7. Interspinales###
- Short paired muscles between spinous processes.  
- Aid in extension and stabilization of the back.  

###8. Thoracolumbar Fascia###
- Dense connective tissue covering the back muscles.  
- Provides attachment and mechanical support for surrounding muscle groups.  

##Function##
- **Extend, flex, and stabilize** the vertebral column.  
- **Support posture** and maintain the strength of the topline.  
- **Transfer force** between the hindquarters and forequarters during movement.  
- **Assist in breathing** through rib motion and spinal expansion.  
- Protect and stabilize the spine under load or during flexion and collection.

#Tail Muscles#

The horse’s tail muscles form the flexible extension of the spine, allowing expression, balance, and protection.  
They control tail movement for communication, fly defense, and alignment of the hindquarters.  
Energetically, they represent flow, release, and emotional balance — the freedom to express and let go.

###Parts###

##Superficial Muscles##  
Move the tail side to side and up and down.  
Energetically, they symbolize flexibility and expression.

##Deep Muscles##  
Stabilize the tail base and connect it to the spine.  
Energetically, they reflect grounding and core alignment.

##Intermediate Layers##  
Coordinate fine movements and balance.  
Energetically, they embody smooth flow and harmony.

###Function###  
The tail muscles aid communication, balance, and the release of tension.  
Energetically, they express emotional and energetic states, serving as a mirror of inner calm or agitation.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: emotional holding or restriction.  
Weakness: poor tail carriage or imbalance.  
Asymmetry: uneven movement or spinal tension.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked expression or stored emotional energy.

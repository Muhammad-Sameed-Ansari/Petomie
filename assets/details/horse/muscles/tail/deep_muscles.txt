#Tail Muscles – Deep Layer#

##Location##
Lies closest to the **caudal vertebrae**, deep to the main dorsal and ventral tail muscles.  
Most concentrated at the **dock**, where fine control is needed to manage the heavy equine tail.

###Shape###
Short, compact **segmental muscles** linking neighboring vertebral arches and processes.  
Optimized for **stability and precise control** rather than large excursions.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidi Caudae (Deep Part of Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis)###
- Overlapping fascicles along the dorsal vertebral spines.  
- **Function:** **Stabilize** and subtly **extend** individual tail segments for smooth arcs.

###2. Interspinales Caudae###
- Small muscles between adjacent dorsal spines.  
- **Function:** Provide **midline extension control** and resist unwanted flexion.

###3. Intertransversarii Caudae Profundi###
- Deep slips between transverse processes.  
- **Function:** Control **micro‑lateral movements** and resist shear at each joint.

##Function##
Ensure **segment‑by‑segment stability** of the heavy horse tail for **controlled, powerful swishes**.  
Allow **fine adjustments** for balance during **turning, collection, and acceleration**.  
Support the **dock and pelvic outlet** by controlling torsion and shear forces at the caudal vertebrae.

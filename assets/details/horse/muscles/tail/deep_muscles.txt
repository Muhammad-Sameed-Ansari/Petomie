#Tail Deep Muscles#

The deep tail muscles lie close to the vertebrae, providing strength and stability to the base of the tail.  
They connect directly to the spine, aiding in posture, propulsion, and balance.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, strength, and the root of emotional release.

###Parts###

##Sacrococcygeus Dorsalis##  
Extends and stabilizes the upper tail.  
Energetically, it symbolizes strength and core grounding.

##Sacrococcygeus Ventralis##  
Aids in tail flexion and fine control.  
Energetically, it reflects gentle release and calm surrender.

##Deep Connective Bands##  
Bind tail muscles to the sacrum for stability.  
Energetically, they represent trust and anchored energy.

###Function###  
The deep muscles stabilize and guide tail motion, supporting spinal balance and core engagement.  
Energetically, they form the root of flow and release, grounding emotion into calm presence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: rigidity or emotional holding.  
Weakness: drooping tail or reduced motion.  
Pain: strain from spinal or sacral tension.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disconnection from grounding or fear of release.

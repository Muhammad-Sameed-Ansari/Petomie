#Tail Muscles – Surface Layer#

##Location##
Situated just beneath the **skin and superficial fascia** at the **dock (tail base)** and along the top and sides of the horse’s tail.  
Overlies the deeper tail movers and blends with the **cutaneous trunci** and rump fascia.

###Shape###
Broad, thin **sheet-like slips** and narrow bands spread over the dock and proximal tail.  
Designed for **wide, sweeping movements** of the skin and hair and subtle positioning of the tail.

##Parts##

###1. Caudal Extension of Cutaneous Trunci###
- Superficial sheet over the lateral dock.  
- **Function:** Moves skin and aids quick **tail swishes** against insects.

###2. Superficial Slips of Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Lateralis###
- Along the dorsolateral surface of the dock.  
- **Function:** Light **elevation** and **abduction** of the tail during swishing.

###3. Superficial Slips of Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Lateralis###
- Ventrolateral to the caudal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Gentle **depression** and **adduction** of the tail.

###4. Superficial Intertransversarii Caudae###
- Short segments between adjacent caudal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Assist **side-to-side** motion and surface stabilization of the dock.

##Function##
Provide **fine surface control** of the tail for **fly swatting, signaling, and comfort**.  
Assist deeper muscles in **elevation, depression, and lateral sweep**, giving the horse its characteristic **broad tail swish**.  
Contribute to skin mobility and help smooth transitions between large and small tail movements.

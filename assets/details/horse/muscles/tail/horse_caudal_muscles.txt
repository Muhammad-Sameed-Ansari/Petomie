#Caudal Muscles#

##Location##
Located at the **base of the tail (caudal region)**, extending from the **sacrum and ischium** to the **coccygeal vertebrae** and **tail skin**.  
These muscles form the muscular foundation of the **tail**, surrounding the coccygeal vertebrae on all sides — dorsal, ventral, and lateral.

##Shape##
Composed of **paired, elongated, and spindle-shaped muscles** arranged in layers.  
They vary in thickness along the tail, becoming smaller and more tendinous toward the distal end.  
Muscles are organized into **dorsal, ventral, and lateral groups**, allowing multidirectional tail movement and control.

##Parts##

###1. Dorsolateral Sacrocaudalis (Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Lateralis)###
- Arises from the sacrum and first few coccygeal vertebrae.  
- Inserts on more distal coccygeal vertebrae.  
- Elevates and laterally flexes the tail.  

###2. Medial Sacrocaudalis (Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Medialis)###
- Lies medial to the lateral sacrocaudalis.  
- Extends from the sacrum to the tail vertebrae.  
- Raises and extends the tail dorsally.  

###3. Intertransversarii Caudae###
- Small segmental muscles connecting adjacent transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae.  
- Stabilize and aid in fine tail adjustments.  

###4. Ventral Sacrocaudalis (Sacrocaudalis Ventralis)###
- Divided into **lateralis** and **medialis** parts.  
- Runs along the underside of the tail.  
- Flexes and lowers the tail.  

###5. Coccygeus###
- Triangular muscle arising from the ischial spine to the transverse processes of the first few coccygeal vertebrae.  
- Pulls the tail down and laterally.  
- Helps return the tail to midline position.  

###6. Levator Ani###
- Found deep to the coccygeus muscle.  
- Assists in elevating the anal region and controlling defecation.  

##Function##
- Control **tail movement** in all directions — elevation, depression, and lateral swishing.  
- Assist in **communication**, **balance**, and **fly control**.  
- Support **defecation and reproduction** by stabilizing the anal and perineal region.  
- Maintain **tail tone and alignment** for expressive and protective functions.

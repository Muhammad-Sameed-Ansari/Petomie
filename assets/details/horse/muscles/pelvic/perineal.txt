#Perineal Muscles#

The horse’s perineal muscles form a group around the anus, vulva, and base of the tail.  
They provide control during defecation, urination, and tail movement, and help support the pelvic floor.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, control, and the foundation of physical and emotional stability.

###Parts###

##External Anal Sphincter##  
A circular muscle surrounding the anus that controls opening and closing.  
Energetically, it symbolizes protection, release, and boundary awareness.

##Coccygeus Muscle##  
Extends from the pelvis to the tail base, assisting in tail movement.  
Energetically, it represents freedom and balance between stability and motion.

##Levator Ani Muscle##  
Supports the pelvic organs and aids in defecation.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and the ability to let go with ease.

##Constrictor Vulvae and Constrictor Vestibuli Muscles##  
Present in mares, they help close and protect the vulva.  
Energetically, they symbolize safety, integrity, and feminine energy balance.

###Function###  
The perineal muscles maintain pelvic control, assist in elimination, and stabilize the base of the tail.  
They are vital for posture, movement, and reproductive function.  
Energetically, they anchor the horse’s life force, connecting strength, security, and trust within the body.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension or tightness: emotional stress or strain.  
Weakness: pelvic instability or nerve issues.  
Swelling or pain: inflammation or trauma.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect fear, lack of grounding, or inability to release control.

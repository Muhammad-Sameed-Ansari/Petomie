#Anus Muscle#

The horse’s anus muscle lies at the junction between the tail base and the pelvic outlet.  
It connects the caudal vertebrae, perineum, and anal canal, forming part of the pelvic floor that supports and retracts the anus.  
Energetically, it represents **release, grounding, and trust in the body’s natural flow**.

###Parts###

##Retractor Ani##  
A slender muscle that extends from the tail base to the anal canal.  
It retracts the anus after defecation and assists the anal sphincters in maintaining tone.  
Energetically, symbolizes **completion, relaxation, and renewal**.

##Anococcygeus##  
Connects the coccygeal vertebrae to the rectal wall.  
Supports the anal canal and aids retraction after release.  
Energetically, represents **balance between control and surrender**.

##Perineal Fascia##  
Anchors and blends with the sphincters and perineal structures.  
Energetically, reflects **stability, protection, and flow between holding and letting go**.

###Function###  
The anus muscle supports closure, retraction, and alignment of the anal canal.  
It works with the sphincters to maintain tone, stabilize the pelvic outlet, and complete defecation.  
Energetically, it harmonizes **release and containment**, reflecting emotional and physical trust.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: incomplete release or tension in the pelvic area.  
Weakness: loss of tone or prolapse tendency.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **fear of letting go or holding emotional tension**.

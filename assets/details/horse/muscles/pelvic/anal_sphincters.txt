#Anal Sphincters#

The horse’s anal sphincters are circular muscles surrounding the anus that control elimination and maintain continence.  
They regulate both voluntary and involuntary control, ensuring coordinated function and protection of the lower digestive tract.  
Energetically, they represent **control, release, and balance between tension and trust**.

###Parts###

##External Anal Sphincter##  
A voluntary skeletal muscle that provides conscious control over defecation.  
Energetically, symbolizes **discipline, strength, and awareness of boundaries**.

##Internal Anal Sphincter##  
An involuntary smooth muscle that maintains constant tone and closure.  
Energetically, reflects **trust, protection, and inner security**.

##Perianal Support Fibers##  
Assist fine motor control of the anal region.  
Energetically, embody **flow between control and surrender**.

###Function###  
The anal sphincters ensure continence, regulate defecation, and maintain protection from external contamination.  
Energetically, they balance **holding and letting go**, promoting grounded trust and release.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: constipation or energetic resistance.  
Weakness: loss of control or tension in release.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **fear of letting go or control imbalance**.

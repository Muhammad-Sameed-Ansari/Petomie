#Intermediate Layer – Force Transmission#

The horse’s intermediate muscular layer connects deep stabilizers with the surface muscles.  
It transfers power efficiently through the body during motion.  
Energetically, it represents flow, adaptability, and strength through connection.

###Parts###

##Linking Fibers##  
Bridge inner and outer layers for coordinated movement.  
Energetically, they symbolize communication and teamwork.

##Cross Bands##  
Transmit force between opposite sides of the body.  
Energetically, they represent balance and harmony between effort and ease.

##Support Sheets##  
Spread load evenly to maintain rhythm and endurance.  
Energetically, they reflect fluid strength and adaptability.

###Function###  
The intermediate layer transmits energy and power from the core to the limbs.  
It ensures coordination and smooth transitions between stability and movement.  
Energetically, it harmonizes structure and motion, enabling flow and resilience.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: poor elasticity or tension.  
Weakness: loss of power transfer.  
Asymmetry: uneven movement patterns.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disrupted flow or internal resistance.

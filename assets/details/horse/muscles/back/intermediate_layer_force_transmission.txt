#Intermediate Layer (Force Transmission and Coordination)#

##Location##
Lies between the **deep core muscles** and **outer movement muscles**, forming the **connection between the spine, ribs, pelvis, and limbs**.  
It bridges core stability with dynamic movement, transmitting force smoothly throughout the body.

##Shape##
Made up of **medium-depth, long muscles** that extend along the trunk and neck.  
They coordinate forelimb and hindlimb action during motion and maintain balance in different gaits.

##Parts##

###1. Internal Oblique###
- Beneath the external oblique on the abdominal wall.  
- **Function:** Rotates and flexes trunk; transfers energy through the body.  

###2. Longissimus Dorsi###
- Long muscle along the spine from sacrum to neck.  
- **Function:** Extends and stabilizes back; transmits hindquarter force to forehand.  

###3. Iliocostalis###
- Runs from pelvis to ribs.  
- **Function:** Maintains trunk posture and aids lateral bending.  

###4. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Large, flat muscle on trunk sides.  
- **Function:** Retracts forelimb and assists back flexion.  

###5. External Oblique###
- Outermost abdominal layer.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdomen and aids trunk rotation.  

##Function##
- **Force Transmission:** Transfers propulsive energy from hindquarters to forehand.  
- **Coordination:** Balances trunk and limb motion.  
- **Postural Support:** Maintains spinal alignment in movement.  
- **Flexibility:** Assists bending and collection.

#Deep Layer – Core Stability#

The horse’s deep muscular layer lies closest to the skeleton, wrapping around the spine and pelvis.  
It provides strength, balance, and postural control, forming the foundation for all movement.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, centeredness, and calm inner strength.

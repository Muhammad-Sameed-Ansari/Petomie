#Deep Layer (Core Stability and Alignment)#

##Location##
Located deep within the **abdominal, spinal, and pelvic regions** of the horse.  
These muscles form the **core stability system**, supporting posture, balance, and controlled movement.  
They lie beneath the intermediate and superficial layers, connecting the **pelvis, spine, and ribcage** for precise stability.

##Shape##
Composed of **short, dense, and multi-segmented muscles** arranged close to the vertebral column and pelvis.  
They act together to stabilize the trunk and coordinate fine spinal motion.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidus###
- Small overlapping muscles along the spine from sacrum to neck.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes each vertebra, maintains spinal alignment, and supports collection during movement.

###2. Transversus Abdominis###
- Deep abdominal layer wrapping around the trunk.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdominal contents and stabilizes spine and pelvis during motion.

###3. Psoas Major###
- From lumbar vertebrae to femur.  
- **Function:** Flexes the hip and stabilizes the lumbosacral area during motion and collection.  

###4. Iliacus###
- Lies beside psoas, joining at the femur.  
- **Function:** Works with psoas to flex hip and align pelvis.  

###5. Quadratus Lumborum###
- Between lumbar spine and pelvis.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes lower back and aids lateral bending.  

###6. Diaphragm###
- Dome-shaped muscle dividing chest and abdomen.  
- **Function:** Assists breathing and core engagement for postural balance.  

##Function##
- **Core Stability:** Supports spine and pelvis alignment.  
- **Postural Support:** Maintains collection and balance.  
- **Coordination:** Links hindquarter power with forelimb reach.  
- **Protection:** Supports internal organs through abdominal pressure.  
- **Breathing Integration:** Works with diaphragm for efficient respiration and movement.

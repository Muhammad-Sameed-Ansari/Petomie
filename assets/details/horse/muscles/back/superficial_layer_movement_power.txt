#Superficial Layer (Movement and Power)#

##Location##
Forms the **outermost layer** of the horse’s musculature, covering the body, limbs, and neck.  
Responsible for visible **strength, propulsion, and movement** during motion.

##Shape##
Composed of **large, strong, and elongated muscles** that generate and control locomotor power.  
These muscles provide both **strength and endurance** necessary for running, turning, and jumping.

##Parts##

###1. Trapezius###
- Triangular muscle covering the neck and shoulders.  
- **Function:** Elevates and rotates scapula; aids limb advancement.  

###2. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Broad muscle across trunk sides.  
- **Function:** Retracts limb and assists in pulling actions.  

###3. Gluteal Muscles###
- Over hip and rump region.  
- **Function:** Extend and abduct hip; provide propulsion.  

###4. Quadriceps Femoris###
- Large group on front of thigh.  
- **Function:** Extends stifle and supports weight-bearing.  

###5. Hamstring Group (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus)###
- Along back of thigh.  
- **Function:** Extend hip, retract limb, and power forward motion.  

###6. Pectoral Muscles###
- On chest, connecting forelimb to sternum.  
- **Function:** Adduct limb and support forelimb during stance.  

##Function##
- **Movement and Power:** Produces strength for walking, trotting, and galloping.  
- **Propulsion:** Drives forward motion from hindquarters.  
- **Agility:** Enables smooth transitions, turns, and elevation.  
- **Coordination:** Works with deeper layers for fluid motion and stability.

#Epaxial Muscles#

The horse’s epaxial muscles run along either side of the spine, forming the main extensors of the vertebral column.  
They support posture, stabilize the back, and create propulsion and lift in movement.  
Energetically, they represent **strength, alignment, and resilience through life’s movement**.

###Parts###

##Longissimus Dorsi##  
Extends and stabilizes the spine, crucial for propulsion.  
Energetically, symbolizes **drive and endurance**.

##Iliocostalis##  
Assists in bending and extending the back.  
Energetically, represents **flexibility and adaptability**.

##Spinalis##  
Supports upright posture and fine spinal control.  
Energetically, reflects **integrity and self-alignment**.

###Function###  
The epaxial muscles maintain posture, stabilize the spine, and coordinate back motion during stride.  
Energetically, they align **inner and outer strength for forward movement**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: rigidity or pain along the topline.  
Weakness: dropped back or instability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **burden or emotional rigidity**.

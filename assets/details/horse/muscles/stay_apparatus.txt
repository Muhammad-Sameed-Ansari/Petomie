#Stay Apparatus#

##Location##
Present in both the **forelimbs and hindlimbs** of the horse, forming a unique **support system** that allows the animal to **stand and rest** for long periods with minimal muscular effort.  
- **Forelimb Stay Apparatus:** Extends from the **shoulder to the fetlock**, stabilizing the shoulder, carpus (knee), and fetlock joints.  
- **Hindlimb Stay Apparatus:** Extends from the **hip to the fetlock**, locking the **stifle and hock** to bear weight during rest.

##Shape##
A **complex combination of muscles, tendons, and ligaments** that work mechanically to prevent limb collapse.  
The structure forms a natural tension network that supports body weight and maintains limb alignment.

###Forelimb Components###
1. **Biceps Brachii** – Locks the shoulder joint and resists flexion.  
2. **Lacertus Fibrosus** – Fibrous connection linking the biceps to the **extensor carpi radialis**, transmitting tension from the shoulder to the forearm.  
3. **Serratus Ventralis** – Suspends the trunk between the forelimbs and stabilizes the shoulder.  
4. **Check Ligaments (Proximal & Distal)** – Prevent overextension of the carpal and fetlock joints.  
5. **Superficial & Deep Digital Flexor Tendons** – Support the fetlock and pastern to prevent downward collapse.  

###Hindlimb Components###
1. **Patellar Locking Mechanism** – The **medial patellar ligament** hooks over the **medial trochlear ridge** of the femur to lock the stifle in extension.  
2. **Reciprocal Apparatus** – The **peroneus tertius** and **superficial digital flexor tendon** link the hock and stifle so they move together.  
3. **Suspensory Ligament & Flexor Tendons** – Support the fetlock and pastern, preventing hyperextension and joint sagging.  

##Function##
The stay apparatus enables the horse to **stand and rest without constant muscle use**, conserving energy and maintaining balance.  
- **Supports body weight mechanically**, preventing joint collapse.  
- **Reduces muscular fatigue** during prolonged standing or light sleep.  
- **Allows one limb to rest** while the other supports weight.  
- **Maintains posture and balance** while enabling quick movement if startled.  
- **Conserves energy and enhances circulation**, reflecting the horse’s natural resting behavior.

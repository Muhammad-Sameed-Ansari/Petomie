#Pronator Muscles#

The horse’s **pronator muscles** (teres and quadratus) occupy the **medial aspect of the forearm**, linking the humerus, radius, and ulna.  
They act primarily as **stabilizers and connectors** rather than rotators, maintaining smooth muscular balance and steady joint tone.  
Energetically, they represent **grounded focus, structure, and stability within fluid motion**.

##Pronator Teres##  

###Location###  
Runs obliquely across the **upper medial forearm**, forming a slender band beneath the skin.

###Attachments###  
- **Origin:** Medial epicondyle of the humerus.  
- **Insertion:** Cranial surface of the radius (mid-level).  
- **Associated Structures:** Medial fascia, flexor muscles, joint capsule.

###Shape###  
Flattened, spindle-like muscle with gentle curvature across the forearm.  
Designed for smooth tension transfer rather than mechanical leverage.

###Function###  
Acts as a **stabilizer and mild elbow flexor**.  
Balances medial pressure during stance and stride.  
Energetically, symbolizes **focused stability, control, and measured direction** — the calm strength to hold alignment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: inward pull or forearm stiffness.  
Weakness: decreased control and imbalance in limb tracking.  
Energetically, imbalance may mirror **hesitation, self-restraint, or lack of direction**.

##Pronator Quadratus##  

###Location###  
Situated deep between the **radius and ulna**, filling the lower two-thirds of the interosseous space.

###Attachments###  
- **Origin:** Medial surface of the ulna.  
- **Insertion:** Medial surface of the radius.  
- **Associated Structures:** Interosseous membrane and deep fascia.

###Shape###  
A thin, rectangular sheet of muscle fibers connecting bone to bone, providing firmness and continuous tone.

###Function###  
Acts as a **deep stabilizer**, maintaining alignment and distributing force evenly during limb flexion and extension.  
Supports forearm integrity and fine load transfer.  
Energetically, reflects **quiet endurance, centered strength, and subtle structural awareness**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: tension in the inner forearm or reduced flexibility.  
Weakness: lack of tone or fatigue in weight-bearing.  
Energetically, imbalance may represent **loss of grounding or overstrain from control without flow**.

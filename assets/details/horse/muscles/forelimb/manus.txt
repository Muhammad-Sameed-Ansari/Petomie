#Manus Muscles#

The horse’s manus refers to the distal limb from the knee to the hoof, containing fine tendons and muscles that control precision and balance.  
Though minimal in muscle bulk, this region is essential for weight-bearing and movement accuracy.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, sensitivity, and connection to the Earth.

###Parts###

##Digital Flexors##  
Control bending of the fetlock and hoof.  
Energetically, they symbolize flexibility and grounded response.

##Digital Extensors##  
Lift the hoof during movement.  
Energetically, they represent forward motion and awareness.

##Suspensory Support Structures##  
Stabilize the limb and prevent overextension.  
Energetically, they reflect protection and inner resilience.

###Function###  
The manus muscles and tendons fine-tune limb motion, absorb shock, and maintain balance.  
Energetically, they ground movement, connecting action with sensitivity and stability.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: overloading or fatigue.  
Swelling: inflammation from stress.  
Tenderness: tension or poor circulation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect overextension, stress, or instability in grounding.

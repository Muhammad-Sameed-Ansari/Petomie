#Manus Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **distal forelimb**, within and below the **carpus (knee)** region.  
Responsible for **fine digital control** and hoof stabilization.

##Shape##
Composed mainly of **tendinous structures** and **reduced intrinsic muscles**, replaced by strong ligaments and fibrous tissue for weight support.

##Parts##

###1. Interosseus (Suspensory Ligament)###
- Modified muscle along the metacarpus.  
- **Function:** Supports fetlock and prevents overextension.  

###2. Extensor Branches###
- Continue from interosseus to extensor tendons.  
- **Function:** Stabilize fetlock and assist extension.  

###3. Digital Extensor Tendons###
- Continuations of common and lateral digital extensors.  
- **Function:** Extend digits and lift hoof.  

###4. Digital Flexor Tendons###
- From superficial and deep flexor muscles.  
- **Function:** Flex joints and support distal limb.  

##Function##
Provide **elastic support** to the fetlock, pastern, and coffin joints.  
Assist in **shock absorption** and control limb rebound during stride.  
Maintain **hoof balance** and prevent hyperextension.

#Brachium Muscles#

##Location##
Situated between the **shoulder and elbow**, surrounding the **humerus**.  
These muscles control **flexion and extension of the elbow joint**.

##Shape##
Long, cylindrical muscles organized into **cranial (flexor)** and **caudal (extensor)** groups.

##Parts##

###Cranial (Flexor) Group###

###1. Biceps Brachii###
- Large muscle on cranial humerus.  
- **Function:** Extends shoulder and flexes elbow; stabilizes limb during stance.  

###2. Brachialis###
- Lies lateral to biceps brachii.  
- **Function:** Flexes elbow and assists with limb folding during movement.

###Caudal (Extensor) Group###

###3. Triceps Brachii###
- Composed of long, lateral, and medial heads.  
- **Function:** Extends elbow and supports body weight during stance.  

###4. Tensor Fasciae Antebrachii###
- Lies medial to triceps.  
- **Function:** Extends elbow and tightens antebrachial fascia.  

##Function##
- **Flexion:** Achieved by biceps and brachialis.  
- **Extension:** Controlled by triceps and tensor fasciae.  
- **Stabilization:** Maintains elbow alignment during motion and weight-bearing.

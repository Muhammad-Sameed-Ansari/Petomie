#Supinator Muscle#

The horse’s **supinator muscle** is part of the **lateral forearm musculature**, lying on the upper portion of the radius.  
Although the horse’s forearm has limited rotational ability due to fusion of the radius and ulna, the supinator remains an important **stabilizer and fine-tuning muscle** during elbow flexion and movement.  
Energetically, it represents **alertness, readiness, and flexible control** — the power to respond with fluid awareness.

###Location###  
Situated on the **lateral and cranial surfaces** of the proximal forearm.  
It lies deep to the **extensor carpi radialis** and **common digital extensor** muscles.

###Attachments###  
- **Origin:** Lateral epicondyle of the humerus.  
- **Insertion:** Cranial and medial surfaces of the proximal radius.  
- **Associated Structures:** Lateral collateral ligament of the elbow, joint capsule.

###Shape###  
A short, broad, and slightly twisted muscle with oblique fibers wrapping around the proximal radius.  
Its texture is firm and elastic, built for stabilization rather than force.

###Parts###  

##Superficial Layer##  
Provides the main connection to the humerus, stabilizing the lateral elbow joint.  
Energetically, symbolizes **outer control and physical readiness**.

##Deep Fibers##  
Wrap around the radius for precise micro-stabilization during flexion.  
Energetically, represent **inner awareness and adaptability**.

###Function###  
- Stabilizes the **elbow joint** during flexion and extension.  
- Aids in limited **lateral rotation of the radius**.  
- Prevents inward twisting during weight-bearing.  
Energetically, the supinator promotes **fluid awareness and balanced strength**, guiding controlled action.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: lateral elbow stiffness or limited flexion.  
Weakness: instability during bending or uneven tension in the forearm.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **tension between alertness and trust**, or over-control of subtle movement.

#Antebrachium Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **elbow and carpus (knee)**, forming the middle portion of the forelimb.  
These muscles manage **flexion, extension, and rotation** of the carpus and digits.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, spindle-shaped muscles** with extended tendons reaching the carpus and hoof.  
Divided into **cranial (extensor)** and **caudal (flexor)** groups.

##Parts##

###Cranial (Extensor) Group###

###1. Extensor Carpi Radialis###
- On the dorsolateral forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends carpus and stabilizes the knee joint.  

###2. Common Digital Extensor###
- Central dorsal muscle.  
- **Function:** Extends digits and assists carpal extension.  

###3. Lateral Digital Extensor###
- Lateral to the common extensor.  
- **Function:** Extends digit IV and aids in carpal stability.  

###4. Ulnaris Lateralis###
- Caudolateral surface of forearm.  
- **Function:** Flexes carpus and supports stability during stance.  

###5. Supinator###
- Proximal forearm region.  
- **Function:** Rotates forelimb laterally; assists in stabilization.

###Caudal (Flexor) Group###

###6. Flexor Carpi Radialis###
- Medial forearm surface.  
- **Function:** Flexes carpus and maintains stability during motion.  

###7. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris###
- Has humeral and ulnar heads.  
- **Function:** Flexes carpus and aids load absorption.  

###8. Superficial Digital Flexor###
- Lies between carpal flexors.  
- **Function:** Flexes digits and supports fetlock joint.  

###9. Deep Digital Flexor###
- Deepest muscle with three heads.  
- **Function:** Flexes all phalangeal joints and supports hoof mechanics.  

###10. Pronator Teres###
- Small muscle near elbow.  
- **Function:** Rotates forearm medially (limited in horse).

##Function##
- **Extension:** Achieved by cranial muscles to advance limb.  
- **Flexion:** Caudal muscles flex carpus and digits during stance.  
- **Support:** Stabilize joints and control impact during locomotion.

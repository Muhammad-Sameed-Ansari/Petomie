#Antebrachium Muscles#

The horse’s antebrachium, or lower forelimb, extends from the elbow to the knee (carpus).  
Its muscles control flexion and extension of the limb, supporting precise and fluid motion.  
Energetically, they represent flexibility, coordination, and graceful response.

###Parts###

##Extensor Muscles##  
Run along the front, lifting the limb and extending joints.  
Energetically, they symbolize expression and upward flow.

##Flexor Muscles##  
Located along the back, they control bending and weight-bearing.  
Energetically, they reflect stability and adaptability.

##Ulnaris and Radialis Groups##  
Assist in fine-tuning motion and balance.  
Energetically, they embody harmony and balance between strength and control.

###Function###  
The antebrachium muscles enable smooth flexion and extension of the forelimb, coordinating stride and landing.  
Energetically, they express flow and grace, supporting awareness in every movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: overuse or strain.  
Tendon tension: poor flexibility or fatigue.  
Uneven motion: imbalance between flexors and extensors.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect tension between control and freedom.

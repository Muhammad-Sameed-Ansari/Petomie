#Shoulder Muscles#

The horse’s shoulder muscles form the powerful connection between the neck, trunk, and forelimb.  
They lift, extend, and stabilize the forelimb during motion, absorbing shock and providing balance.  
Energetically, they represent strength, direction, and trust in forward movement.

###Parts###

##Trapezius##  
Raises and rotates the shoulder blade.  
Energetically, it symbolizes elevation, freedom, and readiness.

##Deltoid##  
Moves the forelimb outward and forward.  
Energetically, it reflects courage and expression in action.

##Supraspinatus##  
Stabilizes the shoulder joint and aids extension.  
Energetically, it represents steady confidence and balanced strength.

##Infraspinatus##  
Prevents shoulder overextension and provides flexibility.  
Energetically, it embodies adaptability and harmony in movement.

###Function###  
The shoulder muscles stabilize and move the scapula and forelimb, controlling stride and impact.  
Energetically, they anchor trust and strength, supporting smooth and confident forward motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted reach or stiffness.  
Weakness: shortened stride or instability.  
Pain on lift: overuse or strain.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitation, burden, or loss of confidence in movement.

#Shoulder Muscles#

##Location##
Located around the **scapular region**, connecting the **neck, thorax, and humerus**.  
These muscles stabilize the shoulder joint and move the forelimb during locomotion.

##Shape##
Composed of **broad, strong muscles** surrounding the scapula.  
Divided into **extrinsic (connecting limb to body)** and **intrinsic (within shoulder)** muscle groups.

##Parts##

###Extrinsic Muscles###

###1. Trapezius###
- Divided into cervical and thoracic parts.  
- **Function:** Elevates and advances the scapula; aids in forelimb movement.  

###2. Rhomboideus###
- Lies deep to the trapezius.  
- **Function:** Draws scapula upward and forward; maintains trunk stability.  

###3. Serratus Ventralis###
- Large, fan-shaped muscle connecting scapula to thorax.  
- **Function:** Suspends trunk between forelimbs and supports weight-bearing.  

###4. Omotransversarius###
- Narrow muscle from atlas to scapular spine.  
- **Function:** Advances limb and flexes neck laterally.  

###Intrinsic Muscles###

###5. Supraspinatus###
- Fills supraspinous fossa of scapula.  
- **Function:** Extends shoulder and stabilizes scapulohumeral joint.  

###6. Infraspinatus###
- Occupies infraspinous fossa.  
- **Function:** Flexes shoulder and prevents excessive medial rotation.  

###7. Subscapularis###
- Medial surface of scapula.  
- **Function:** Adducts and stabilizes shoulder joint.  

###8. Teres Major###
- Caudal border of scapula.  
- **Function:** Flexes shoulder and rotates humerus medially.  

###9. Deltoideus###
- Covers lateral shoulder.  
- **Function:** Flexes shoulder and assists abduction.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Maintain shoulder stability and trunk suspension.  
- **Movement:** Enable limb protraction, retraction, and rotation.  
- **Coordination:** Absorb impact and align shoulder joint during motion.

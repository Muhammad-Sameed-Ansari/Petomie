#Throat Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **upper neck and throat region**, connecting the **mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus**.  
These muscles form the walls of the **pharyngeal and laryngeal passages**, controlling **swallowing, breathing, and sound**.

##Shape##
Made of **thin, layered muscles** that wrap around the **pharynx and larynx**, supported by the **hyoid apparatus**.  
Most are **paired muscles**, working together to move the tongue, larynx, and soft palate during swallowing and vocalization.

##Parts##

###1. Pharyngeal Constrictor Muscles###
- **Cricopharyngeus, Thyropharyngeus, Hyopharyngeus**  
- Surround the pharynx in a circular arrangement.  
- **Function:** Contract in sequence to push food from the pharynx into the esophagus during swallowing.

###2. Palatine and Pterygopharyngeal Muscles###
- Located near the **soft palate** and upper throat.  
- **Function:** Lift and tense the soft palate, closing the nasal passage during swallowing.  

###3. Hyoid Muscles###
- Connect the **tongue, larynx, and skull** via the **hyoid bones**.  
- Include **geniohyoideus, sternohyoideus, and thyrohyoideus**.  
- **Function:** Move the larynx and tongue forward or backward to aid swallowing and breathing.  

###4. Laryngeal Muscles###
- Surround the **larynx (voice box)** and control the opening of the airway.  
- Include **cricoarytenoideus dorsalis, cricoarytenoideus lateralis, thyroarytenoideus, and cricothyroideus**.  
- **Function:** Open and close the airway, adjust the vocal cords, and protect the trachea during swallowing.  

###5. Sternothyroideus###
- Extends from the sternum to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx.  
- **Function:** Draws the larynx backward after swallowing and helps in respiration.  

###6. Cricothyroideus###
- Between cricoid and thyroid cartilages.  
- **Function:** Tenses the vocal cords to alter pitch and tone of vocal sounds.  

##Function##
- **Swallowing:** Moves food from the mouth to the esophagus in a coordinated wave.  
- **Breathing:** Opens and stabilizes the airway during inhalation and exhalation.  
- **Vocalization:** Controls vocal cords for neighing and other sounds.  
- **Protection:** Prevents food from entering the airway.  
- **Coordination:** Works with tongue and hyoid structures to synchronize swallowing and respiration.

#Throat Muscles#

##Location##
The throat muscles of the horse are located in the ventral and lateral regions of the neck, surrounding the pharynx, larynx, and hyoid apparatus.
They connect the lower jaw, tongue, and larynx to the sternum and shoulder region, forming the muscular base of the throat.

##Shape##
Composed of long strap-like muscles, narrow bands, and fan-shaped sheets.
They form several layers—superficial, middle, and deep—encompassing the structures of the throat and upper airway.

##Main Muscles##
- Sternohyoideus: Extends from the sternum to the basihyoid bone; lies along the ventral midline of the neck.
- Sternothyroideus: Runs parallel and lateral to the sternohyoideus, from the sternum to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx.
- Omohyoideus: Extends from the shoulder fascia near the scapula to the basihyoid bone; separates the external jugular vein from the carotid artery.
- Geniohyoideus: Located deep to the mandible, connecting the chin to the basihyoid bone; assists in swallowing.
- Mylohyoideus: Thin, sheet-like muscle forming the floor of the mouth, connecting both sides of the mandible.
- Hyoid Muscles (Group): Include several small muscles connecting the hyoid bones to the skull and larynx, stabilizing these structures during swallowing and vocalization.
- Pharyngeal Constrictors (Cricopharyngeus, Thyropharyngeus, Hyopharyngeus): Encircle the pharynx; contract sequentially to push food into the esophagus.
- Cricoarytenoideus Dorsalis: Controls the abduction of the arytenoid cartilages; vital for opening the airway during breathing.

##Function##
- Control movement of the larynx and pharynx during swallowing and breathing.
- Stabilize and move the hyoid apparatus and tongue.
- Protect the airway and regulate airflow to the lungs.
- Support vocalization, chewing, and swallowing.
- Maintain throat and neck posture and coordination during locomotion.

#Superficial Pectoral Muscles#

The horse’s superficial pectoral muscles lie on the front of the chest, connecting the forelimb to the sternum.  
They control the inward movement of the limbs and help stabilize the shoulder during motion.  
Energetically, they represent love in action, compassion through strength, and connection between heart and movement.

###Parts###

##Descending Pectoral##  
Runs from the sternum to the humerus, drawing the forelimb inward.  
Energetically, it symbolizes giving and receiving — the expression of love through motion.

##Transverse Pectoral##  
Crosses the chest horizontally, aiding in limb adduction and posture.  
Energetically, it reflects emotional balance and grounded strength.

##Fascia and Connective Tissue##  
Bind and protect the muscle layers beneath the skin.  
Energetically, they embody unity, protection, and the flow of heart-centered energy.

###Function###  
The superficial pectorals stabilize and move the forelimb, maintaining balance and smooth coordination.  
They support the horse’s front-end strength and assist in pulling and turning movements.  
Energetically, they represent the outward flow of the heart — strength guided by compassion and trust.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted stride or chest tension.  
Weakness: instability or reduced control in turns.  
Soreness: overuse from imbalance or tension.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect guarded emotions, overgiving, or blocked heart expression.

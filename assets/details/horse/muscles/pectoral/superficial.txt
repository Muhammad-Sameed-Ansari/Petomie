#Superficial Pectoral Muscles#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral chest**, covering the front and sides of the sternum and extending toward the **humerus and shoulder region**.  
Composed of two main parts: the **descending pectoral** (cranial portion) and the **transverse pectoral** (caudal portion).  
These muscles lie just beneath the skin and are easily visible when the horse is viewed from the front.

###Shape###
Broad, flat muscles forming a muscular sheet along the chest.  
The descending pectoral runs obliquely from the sternum upward and outward to the humerus, while the transverse pectoral runs more horizontally across the lower chest.  
They are well-developed and fused medially along the midline.

##Function##
Adduct the forelimb toward the midline, drawing it inward during stance and locomotion.  
Assist in **limb retraction** and stabilization when weight is applied.  
Support the trunk and aid balance during walking, trotting, and galloping.  
Contribute to **shoulder movement** and coordination with the deep pectoral for propulsion.  
During locomotion, the superficial pectorals help **control limb adduction**, providing fine motor adjustment during stride.  
Also play a role in **shock absorption** and maintaining symmetry in the shoulder girdle.

#Deep Pectoral Muscle (Ascending Pectoral)#

##Location##
Located beneath the superficial pectorals on the **ventral thorax and sternum**, extending from the **sternal region** to the **greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus**.  
Forms the deepest and most powerful portion of the pectoral group, lying between the forelimbs under the thoracic floor.

###Shape###
Large, thick, fan-shaped muscle with a wide origin and narrow insertion.  
The fibers run upward and outward from the sternum toward the humerus, forming a strong ascending pattern.  
Heavily developed to support the trunk between the forelimbs and assist propulsion.

##Function##
Draws the limb **caudally and medially**, pulling it backward during the propulsion phase of stride.  
When the limb is fixed, it draws the trunk forward, assisting in **forward motion and weight transfer**.  
Provides **power and support** during acceleration, pulling, and uphill movement.  
Acts synergistically with the superficial pectorals to stabilize the shoulder joint and prevent lateral deviation.  
Also aids in **postural balance** by maintaining the alignment of the forelimbs and chest during motion and stance.  
In conjunction with surrounding muscles (serratus ventralis, subclavius), forms part of the **sling apparatus** that suspends the trunk between the forelimbs.  
Essential for **dynamic stabilization** during high-speed locomotion and bearing the horse’s body weight when turning or braking.

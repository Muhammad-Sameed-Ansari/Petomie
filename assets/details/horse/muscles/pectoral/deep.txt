#Deep Pectoral Muscles#

The horse’s deep pectoral muscles lie beneath the superficial layer, attaching the sternum to the humerus.  
They draw the forelimb backward and upward, stabilizing the chest and aiding propulsion.  
Energetically, they represent inner strength, emotional grounding, and the deep power of the heart.

###Parts###

##Ascending Pectoral##  
Runs from the sternum to the humerus, pulling the limb inward and back.  
Energetically, it symbolizes rooted strength and the courage to move forward with heart.

##Deep Connective Bands##  
Support the chest and link the forelimbs to the body’s core.  
Energetically, they reflect trust, support, and unity of motion.

##Intermuscular Layers##  
Bind the muscle to surrounding tissues, maintaining alignment.  
Energetically, they represent harmony between inner and outer strength.

###Function###  
The deep pectoral muscles stabilize and retract the forelimb, providing power during stride and collection.  
They also anchor the trunk, supporting the horse’s core and balance.  
Energetically, they express deep compassion, strength through emotion, and grounding from the heart center.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: limited stride or chest restriction.  
Weakness: lack of strength or poor balance.  
Pain: strain from excessive pulling or imbalance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect emotional heaviness, guarded vulnerability, or lack of trust in movement.

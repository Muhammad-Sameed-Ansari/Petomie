#Respiration Muscles#

##Location##
Located primarily in the **thoracic region**, surrounding the **rib cage**, **diaphragm**, and **abdominal wall**.  
These muscles form the walls of the thorax and abdomen, working together to expand and compress the chest cavity for breathing.  
They connect the ribs, sternum, and vertebrae, extending into the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.

##Shape##
Composed of **flat, sheet-like and intercostal muscles**, combined with the **dome-shaped diaphragm**.  
Include both **inspiratory (inhalation)** and **expiratory (exhalation)** muscles that coordinate rhythmically to control airflow and pressure changes within the lungs.  
Their fibers run in alternating directions between ribs, providing both strength and elasticity.

##Parts##

###1. Diaphragm###
- Dome-shaped muscular partition between thoracic and abdominal cavities.  
- Originates from the lumbar vertebrae, ribs, and sternum.  
- Inserts into the central tendon.  
- Contracts during inspiration, flattening to increase thoracic volume.  

###2. External Intercostal Muscles###
- Located between the ribs, fibers running caudoventrally.  
- Elevate the ribs during inspiration, expanding the chest cavity.  

###3. Internal Intercostal Muscles###
- Deep to the external intercostals, fibers run cranioventrally.  
- Depress the ribs during expiration, reducing thoracic volume.  

###4. Serratus Dorsalis Cranialis###
- Upper lateral thoracic region.  
- Elevates ribs to assist inspiration.  

###5. Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis###
- Caudal thoracic region.  
- Depresses ribs during expiration.  

###6. Scalenus###
- Extends from cervical vertebrae to the first few ribs.  
- Stabilizes the cranial ribs and assists in inspiration.  

###7. Rectus Thoracis###
- Small muscle along the lateral thorax.  
- Aids in lifting the first ribs during inspiration.  

###8. Transversus Thoracis###
- Inner surface of the sternum and costal cartilages.  
- Draws ribs downward during expiration.  

###9. Abdominal Muscles###
*(Assist in forced expiration by pushing abdominal organs against the diaphragm.)*  
- **External Abdominal Oblique** – compresses abdomen, assists expiration.  
- **Internal Abdominal Oblique** – deep to external layer, helps force exhalation.  
- **Transversus Abdominis** – deepest layer, stabilizes and compresses the trunk.  
- **Rectus Abdominis** – runs along the sternum to pubis, aids expiration and posture.  

##Function##
- **Inspiration:** Diaphragm and external intercostals expand the thoracic cavity, drawing air into the lungs.  
- **Expiration:** Internal intercostals and abdominal muscles reduce thoracic volume, forcing air out.  
- **Forced breathing:** Abdominal muscles and serratus dorsalis enhance active expiration.  
- **Support:** Maintain thoracic stability, assist posture, and protect internal organs.

#Abdominal Ventral Muscles#

The horse’s ventral abdominal muscles run along the underside of the belly.  
They support breathing, posture, and organ stability while assisting in lifting and collection.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, flow, and centered awareness.

###Parts###

##Ventral Line##  
Extends from the sternum to the pelvis, forming a supportive base.  
Energetically, it symbolizes foundation and alignment.

##Lower Muscle Bands##  
Control abdominal lift during movement.  
Energetically, they reflect strength and responsiveness.

##Connecting Fibers##  
Link both sides of the body for balance.  
Energetically, they embody harmony and centered flow.

###Function###  
The ventral abdominal muscles stabilize the underside, assist in collection, and protect the internal organs.  
Energetically, they maintain harmony between motion and rest, grounding the horse’s strength through calm awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Sagging belly: weak muscle tone.  
Tight underside: restriction or strain.  
Uneven lift: asymmetrical engagement.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of grounding or uneven emotional balance.

#Abdominal Muscles – Ventral Region#

##Location##
Found along the **underside of the abdomen**, extending from the sternum to the pelvic region.  
These muscles form the **ventral floor** of the trunk, supporting organs and assisting movement.

###Shape###
Made of **broad, flat sheets** and **tendinous fibers** arranged longitudinally.  
They provide a strong but flexible base that protects and stabilizes internal structures.

###1. Rectus Abdominis###
- Central muscle on the ventral midline.  
- **Function:** Supports the belly, aids in flexion, and stabilizes the trunk.  

###2. Transversus Abdominis###
- Deepest muscle layer wrapping the abdomen.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdomen and supports viscera.  

###3. Superficial and Deep Fascia###
- Connective tissue layers covering abdominal wall.  
- **Function:** Provides support, elasticity, and tension distribution.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Maintains abdominal tone and holds organs.  
- **Stability:** Contributes to posture and balance.  
- **Respiration:** Helps with expiration and abdominal compression.  
- **Movement:** Assists flexion and bending of trunk.

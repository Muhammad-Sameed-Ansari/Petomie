#Abdominal Central Muscles#

The horse’s central abdominal muscles form the supportive core of the body, linking the chest and pelvis.  
They stabilize the trunk, protect internal organs, and assist with breathing and movement.  
Energetically, they represent strength, balance, and connection between power and grace.

###Parts###

##Central Line##  
Runs along the midline, supporting posture and coordination.

##Core Sheets##  
Broad layers that wrap around the abdomen, providing strength and tone.  
Energetically, they reflect inner stability and grounded focus.

##Support Fibers##

###Function###  
The central abdominal muscles stabilize the spine, support breathing, and assist in bending and flexion.  
Energetically, they anchor the horse’s core strength, supporting confidence and harmony in movement.

###Common Imbalances###

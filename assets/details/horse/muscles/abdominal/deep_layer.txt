#Abdominal Deep Layer#

The horse’s deep abdominal muscles form the innermost layer of support around the organs.  
They maintain posture, assist breathing, and provide protection for the internal structures.  
Energetically, they represent inner strength, grounding, and calm control.

###Parts###

##Inner Support Fibers##  
Wrap closely around the organs to maintain shape and protection.  
Energetically, they symbolize inner security and quiet power.

##Deep Core Bands##  
Stabilize the spine and help control fine movement.  
Energetically, they reflect steadiness and balance.

##Connective Layer##  
Links the deep muscle to outer layers for smooth coordination.  
Energetically, it represents connection and inner alignment.

###Function###  
The deep abdominal muscles support the horse’s core, hold the organs in place, and assist with breathing.  
Energetically, they form the foundation of stability, peace, and self-assurance.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: internal stress or strain.  
Weakness: lack of core stability.  
Uneven tension: imbalance in movement.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect fear, tension, or instability at the core.

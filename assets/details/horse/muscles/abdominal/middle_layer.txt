#Abdominal Muscles – Middle Layer#

##Location##
Lies between the deep and superficial abdominal layers, covering the flanks and sides of the horse.  
It links the back and ventral muscles for force transmission and balance.

###Shape###
Broad, flat muscle sheets that run diagonally from the ribs and pelvis toward the midline.  
They overlap with the external and transversus muscles to create strength and flexibility.

##Parts##

###1. Internal Abdominal Oblique###
- Lies beneath the external oblique.  
- **Function:** Rotates trunk, stabilizes abdomen, and transfers force between limbs.  

###2. Iliocostalis###
- Connects ribs to pelvis.  
- **Function:** Aids lateral bending and trunk extension.  

##Function##
- **Force Transfer:** Connects movement between limbs.  
- **Coordination:** Controls trunk twisting and rotation.  
- **Support:** Assists posture and body stability.  
- **Breathing:** Works with other abdominal layers in respiration.

#Stay Apparatus#

##Location##
Present in both the forelimbs and hindlimbs of the horse, allowing the animal to stand and rest while minimizing muscular effort.
- **Forelimb Stay Apparatus:** Extends from the shoulder to the fetlock, involving muscles, tendons, and ligaments that stabilize the joints.
- **Hindlimb Stay Apparatus:** Extends from the hip to the fetlock, locking the stifle and hock in place to support body weight during rest.

##Shape##
A complex system of interconnected tendons, ligaments, and specialized muscles that act together to support the horse’s weight.
- **Forelimb Components:**
  - **Biceps Brachii:** Locks the shoulder and prevents flexion.
  - **Lacertus Fibrosus:** Connects biceps to the extensor carpi radialis for tension transmission.
  - **Serratus Ventralis:** Suspends the trunk between the forelimbs.
  - **Check Ligaments & Flexor Tendons:** Prevent overextension of the carpal and fetlock joints.
- **Hindlimb Components:**
  - **Patellar Locking Mechanism:** Medial patellar ligament hooks over the medial trochlear ridge of the femur to “lock” the stifle.
  - **Reciprocal Apparatus:** Peroneus tertius and superficial digital flexor tendon ensure hock and stifle move together.
  - **Suspensory Ligament & Flexor Tendons:** Support fetlock and pastern, preventing collapse.

##Function##
Allows the horse to stand for long periods with minimal muscular fatigue and rest one limb while supporting weight on the other.
- **Prevents joint collapse** by mechanically locking major joints.
- **Reduces muscular effort** during standing and light sleep.
- **Maintains posture and readiness to move quickly** if needed.
- **Enables alternating rest between limbs**, crucial for circulation and comfort.
- **Supports overall stability and energy conservation** during prolonged standing behavior typical of horses.

#Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis#

The serratus dorsalis caudalis lies along the upper ribs toward the back of the horse’s trunk.  
It assists in drawing the ribs backward during exhalation, promoting deep, complete breathing.  
Energetically, it represents renewal through release and grounding through breath.

###Parts###

##Caudal Fibers##  
Pull the ribs backward to aid exhalation.  
Energetically, they symbolize deep release and grounding energy.

##Fascial Connections##  
Link to surrounding back muscles for coordinated movement.  
Energetically, they reflect harmony between breath and posture.

###Function###  
This muscle supports strong exhalation and connects breathing with back motion and core stability.  
Energetically, it links breath with grounding, helping the horse remain steady and calm.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: reduced rib movement.  
Tightness: shallow breathing.  
Asymmetry: imbalance in back and rib tension.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect ungrounded energy or incomplete emotional release.

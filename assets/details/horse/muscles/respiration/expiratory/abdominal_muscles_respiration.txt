#Abdominal Muscles (Respiration)#

The horse’s abdominal muscles play a key role in breathing, especially during exhalation.  
They help push air from the lungs, stabilize the trunk, and support rhythmic breathing.  
Energetically, they represent release, flow, and the natural rhythm of life’s breath.

###Parts###

##External Abdominals##  
Assist in exhalation and body flexion.  
Energetically, they symbolize outward release and letting go.

##Internal Abdominals##  
Support the diaphragm during breathing.  
Energetically, they reflect inner calm and centered flow.

##Oblique Layers##  
Help control breathing pressure and movement balance.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and coordination of breath and body.

###Function###  
The abdominal muscles support exhalation, stabilize the trunk, and balance internal pressure during motion and rest.  
Energetically, they allow the horse to release tension and renew energy with each breath.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: shallow breathing or restriction.  
Weakness: poor core stability or fatigue.  
Uneven tone: imbalance in movement rhythm.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect tension, emotional holding, or resistance to release.

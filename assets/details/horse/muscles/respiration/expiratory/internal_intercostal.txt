#Internal Intercostal Muscles#

The horse’s internal intercostal muscles lie between the ribs, helping control breathing and trunk movement.  
They assist with exhalation, supporting the rhythm of breath and the release of air.  
Energetically, they represent flow, adaptability, and the peaceful rhythm of letting go.

###Parts###

##Inner Rib Fibers##  
Contract to pull the ribs inward during exhalation.  
Energetically, they symbolize the gentle contraction before release.

##Costal Layers##  
Maintain structural integrity of the rib cage.  
Energetically, they reflect balance between protection and openness.

###Function###  
The internal intercostals coordinate with the diaphragm and abdominals to assist breathing and support the rib cage.  
Energetically, they create the rhythm of giving and releasing — the pulse of calm exhalation.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiff ribs: tension or restricted breath.  
Pain between ribs: overuse or stress.  
Uneven motion: imbalance in breath flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect suppressed emotion or difficulty in letting go.

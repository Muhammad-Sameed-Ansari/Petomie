#Rectus Thoracis#

The rectus thoracis muscle lies along the front ribs, connecting them to the sternum.  
It assists with inhalation by lifting the ribs forward and upward.  
Energetically, it represents expansion, vitality, and the forward movement of breath.

###Parts###

##Rib Attachments##  
Pull the ribs forward during inhalation.  
Energetically, they symbolize progress and awakening energy.

##Sternal Connection##  
Links breath motion to the chest center.  
Energetically, it reflects heart-led expansion and life rhythm.

###Function###  
The rectus thoracis helps lift and expand the ribcage during inhalation.  
Energetically, it supports the feeling of opening to life — taking in new energy with strength and calm.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted breathing or chest stiffness.  
Weakness: shallow breath.  
Asymmetry: uneven rib expansion.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitation or lack of motivation to move forward.

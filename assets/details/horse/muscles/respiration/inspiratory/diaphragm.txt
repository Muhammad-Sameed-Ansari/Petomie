#Diaphragm#

The diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration in the horse.  
It forms a dome-shaped partition between the chest and abdominal cavities, expanding and contracting with each breath.  
Energetically, it represents flow, renewal, and the sacred rhythm of life itself.

###Parts###

##Muscular Dome##  
Contracts to draw air into the lungs.

##Central Tendon##

Energetically, it reflects unity and balance between body and spirit.

##Crura Attachments##

###Function###  
The diaphragm allows inhalation by expanding the chest cavity, drawing air into the lungs.  
Energetically, it supports release and renewal, aligning the horse’s rhythm with the flow of life force.

###Common Imbalances###  
Restricted movement: shallow breathing or tension.  
Weak contraction: reduced stamina or energy.  
Tight attachments: imbalance in posture or flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect resistance to change or emotional holding.

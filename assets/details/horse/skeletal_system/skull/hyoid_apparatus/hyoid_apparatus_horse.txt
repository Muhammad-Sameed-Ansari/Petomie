#Hyoid Apparatus#

##Location##
Located in the throat region between the mandibles and the larynx, suspended from the base of the skull. It connects the tongue, larynx, and pharynx, serving as a supportive framework for these structures.

##Shape##
Consists of a series of small, paired bones joined by cartilage and connective tissue. The main components include:
- **Stylohyoid:** The largest element, extending from the skull to the epihyoid.
- **Epihyoid:** Short rod-like bone linking the stylohyoid and ceratohyoid.
- **Ceratohyoid:** Connects the epihyoid to the basihyoid.
- **Basihyoid:** Central transverse bone located in the midline, containing a lingual process projecting forward into the tongue.
- **Thyrohyoid:** Connects the basihyoid to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx.

##Function##
Supports and suspends the tongue and larynx
Facilitates swallowing, breathing, and vocalization
Anchors muscles involved in tongue and pharyngeal movements
Stabilizes the airway and contributes to correct alignment of the upper respiratory tract
Acts as a resonance and balance structure within the throat and jaw region

#Lymph#

##Location##
Lymph is a **clear fluid** that travels through the **lymphatic system**, a network of vessels, ducts, and nodes found throughout the horse’s body.  
It runs alongside blood vessels and drains excess fluid from tissues back into the bloodstream.  
Major lymph nodes are found in the **neck, jaw, shoulder, chest, groin, and behind the knees**.

##Shape##
Lymph is a **clear or slightly yellowish fluid** containing water, proteins, and white blood cells called lymphocytes.  
It moves slowly through thin-walled vessels with valves that prevent backflow.

##Parts##

###1. Lymph Fluid###
- Clear liquid that surrounds tissues.  
- **Function:** Removes waste, toxins, and excess fluid from body tissues.  

###2. Lymph Nodes###
- Small, bean-shaped organs throughout the body.  
- **Function:** Filter lymph and destroy harmful microorganisms.  

###3. Lymph Vessels###
- Thin tubes that carry lymph throughout the body.  
- **Function:** Return filtered lymph fluid to the bloodstream.  

###4. Lymphocytes###
- White blood cells (T and B cells).  
- **Function:** Fight infections and regulate immune response.  

###5. Spleen###
- Located near the stomach.  
- **Function:** Stores and filters blood, produces lymphocytes, and removes damaged cells.  

###6. Thymus###
- Found in the chest, larger in young horses.  
- **Function:** Helps produce and mature T cells for immunity.  

###7. Tonsils###
- Found at the back of the throat.  
- **Function:** Capture bacteria and viruses entering through the mouth or nose.  

##Function##
- **Immunity:** Defends against infections and diseases.  
- **Fluid balance:** Removes excess fluid and returns it to the blood.  
- **Filtration:** Cleans lymph before it re-enters circulation.  
- **Waste removal:** Helps eliminate toxins, bacteria, and debris.  
- **Transport:** Moves immune cells throughout the body.

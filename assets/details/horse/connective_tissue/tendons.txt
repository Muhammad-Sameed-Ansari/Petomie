#Tendons#

##Location##
Tendons are **strong, cord-like bands of connective tissue** that connect **muscles to bones** throughout the horse’s body.  
They are especially important in the **legs**, where they act like elastic springs to store and release energy during movement, allowing efficient motion with minimal effort.

##Shape##
Tendons appear as **shiny, fibrous cords or flat bands**, made mainly of collagen fibers.  
They are slightly elastic, enabling the horse’s legs to absorb impact and push off powerfully during running, jumping, or landing.

##Parts##

###1. Superficial Digital Flexor Tendon (SDFT)###
- Runs down the back of the leg, from above the knee or hock to the pastern.  
- **Function:** Flexes the lower leg joints and supports the fetlock during movement.  

###2. Deep Digital Flexor Tendon (DDFT)###
- Lies beneath the SDFT and attaches to the coffin bone.  
- **Function:** Flexes the hoof and lower limb and helps with shock absorption.  

###3. Common Digital Extensor Tendon###
- Found along the front of the leg.  
- **Function:** Extends the limb and straightens the leg during forward motion.  

###4. Lateral Digital Extensor Tendon###
- Runs along the side of the cannon bone.  
- **Function:** Aids in extension and stability of the leg.  

###5. Suspensory Ligament (Modified Tendon)###
- Located between the cannon bone and flexor tendons.  
- **Function:** Supports the fetlock joint, prevents it from dropping too low, and acts as an elastic spring for forward propulsion.  

###6. Accessory (Check) Ligaments###
- Small supportive ligaments attached to the flexor tendons.  
- **Function:** Prevent overstretching of tendons and maintain limb stability during fast or high-impact movement.  

###7. Common Extensor Tendon of the Forelimb###
- Extends from the upper foreleg to the top of the hoof.  
- **Function:** Lifts and straightens the leg during movement.  

###8. Patellar Tendons###
- Found in front of the stifle joint.  
- **Function:** Help extend and lock the stifle joint, allowing the horse to stand while resting (part of the stay apparatus).  

###9. Achilles (Calcaneal) Tendon###
- Extends from the thigh muscles to the point of the hock.  
- **Function:** Extends the hock and aids in pushing the body forward during galloping or jumping.  

##Function##
- **Movement:** Transmit muscle force to bones to create motion.  
- **Elastic energy:** Store and release energy to make movement more efficient.  
- **Support:** Maintain joint alignment and leg stability.  
- **Shock absorption:** Reduce stress on joints and bones during landing or impact.  
- **Protection:** Work together with ligaments and fascia to prevent overextension and injury.

#Tendons#

Tendons are fibrous cords connecting muscles to bones.  
They transmit the force of movement and stabilize joints during action.  
Energetically, they represent **discipline, persistence, and direction**, translating intention into motion.

###Parts###

##Collagen Bundles##  
Provide strength and elasticity.  
Energetically, they symbolize endurance and purpose.

##Tendon Sheaths##  
Lubricated coverings reducing friction.  
Energetically, they reflect ease and flow in movement.

##Attachments##  
Points where tendons anchor to bone.  
Energetically, they signify commitment and grounding of will.

###Function###  
Tendons transfer muscular force to bones, enabling movement.  
Energetically, they maintain **focus and alignment**, guiding consistent progress.

###Common Imbalances###  
- Tendon strain: overuse or emotional tension.  
- Inflammation: irritation from imbalance or pressure.  
- Weakness: lack of rest or energetic depletion.  
- Energetic blockage: resistance to action or direction.

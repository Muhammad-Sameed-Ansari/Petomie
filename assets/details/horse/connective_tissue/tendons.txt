#Essential Oils#
Essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts obtained from leaves, flowers, bark, roots, or resin. They carry the plant’s natural aromatic compounds, which affect the limbic system—the emotional center of the brain-making them powerful tools for emotional healing, calming, grounding, and sleep support.

Holistic practitioners use essential oils to:
Reduce stress, anxiety, and emotional overwhelm  
Support deep and restful sleep  
Calm the nervous system  
Balance emotions during healing sessions  
Release tension or stored emotional patterns  
Ground and stabilize energy  
Enhance relaxation, focus, or emotional clarity  
Support animals gently when used safely and diluted  

When used correctly, essential oils can help both humans and animals relax, sleep better, and shift emotional states.

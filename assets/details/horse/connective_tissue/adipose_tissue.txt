#Adipose Tissue#

##Location##
Adipose tissue is **fat-storing connective tissue** found **under the skin**, **around internal organs**, and **between muscles** in horses.  
Common areas include the **neck crest, tailhead, ribs, and abdomen**.  
There are two main types: **white adipose tissue** and **brown adipose tissue**.

##Shape##
It appears as **soft, yellowish tissue** composed of round fat cells (adipocytes).  
These cells store energy as fat and are surrounded by connective fibers and blood vessels.

##Parts##

###1. White Adipose Tissue###
- The main type of fat in adult horses.  
- Found under the skin and around organs.  
- **Function:** Stores energy, cushions organs, and insulates the body.  

###2. Brown Adipose Tissue###
- More active in foals, located around the shoulders, neck, and spine.  
- **Function:** Generates heat to help maintain body temperature.  

###3. Subcutaneous Fat###
- Found just beneath the skin.  
- **Function:** Provides insulation, protects against cold, and stores energy.  

###4. Visceral Fat###
- Found around internal organs.  
- **Function:** Protects and supports internal structures.  

##Function##
- **Energy storage:** Stores energy in the form of fat for later use.  
- **Protection:** Cushions organs and joints against impact.  
- **Insulation:** Maintains body temperature by reducing heat loss.  
- **Metabolic function:** Produces hormones that regulate energy balance.  
- **Healing:** Provides energy for recovery and tissue repair.

#Scapula#

##Location##
The scapula, or shoulder blade, lies on the side of the horse’s thorax, connecting the forelimb to the body through powerful muscles rather than a bone joint.  
It extends from the withers down to the upper shoulder, slanting backward along the ribcage.

###Shape###
A large, flat, triangular bone with a ridge (spine) running diagonally across its surface.  
The lower end forms a shallow socket for the humerus.

###Parts###

##Spine of the Scapula##
A raised ridge dividing the surface into two areas for muscle attachment.  
Energetically, symbolizes structure and balanced direction.

##Supraspinous Fossa##
The upper surface above the spine, housing the supraspinatus muscle.  
Energetically, represents readiness and movement initiation.

##Infraspinous Fossa##
The area below the spine that anchors the infraspinatus muscle.  
Energetically, reflects power, motion, and flow.

##Glenoid Cavity##
The lower socket where the humerus fits, forming the shoulder joint.  
Energetically, connects action with flexibility and trust.

###Function###
Provides attachment for major shoulder and forelimb muscles.  
Transfers motion from the body to the leg and cushions movement through muscular suspension.  
Energetically, governs direction, coordination, and freedom of motion.

#Ligaments#

##Location##
Ligaments are **strong, flexible bands of connective tissue** that connect **bones to bones** throughout the horse’s body.  
They are especially important in **the legs, back, neck, and pelvis**, providing stability, strength, and balance during movement.

##Shape##
Ligaments are **dense, fibrous cords or sheets** made mainly of collagen fibers.  
They are slightly elastic, allowing controlled movement while preventing overstretching.

##Parts##

###1. Suspensory Ligament###
- Found between the cannon bone and flexor tendons.  
- **Function:** Supports the fetlock joint and prevents overextension.  

###2. Nuchal Ligament###
- Runs along the neck from the skull to the withers.  
- **Function:** Supports the head and neck and helps the horse carry the head with less muscle effort.  

###3. Supraspinous Ligament###
- Continues from the nuchal ligament along the spine.  
- **Function:** Supports the back and prevents excessive bending.  

###4. Cruciate Ligaments###
- Found in the stifle joint.  
- **Function:** Stabilize the knee by preventing the bones from sliding forward or backward.  

###5. Collateral Ligaments###
- Found on the sides of most joints.  
- **Function:** Prevent side-to-side motion and provide joint stability.  

###6. Patellar Ligaments###
- Found at the front of the stifle.  
- **Function:** Help lock the stifle and support the stay apparatus.  

###7. Intervertebral Ligaments###
- Found between the vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Maintain spinal alignment and flexibility.  

###8. Sacrotuberous Ligament###
- Connects the pelvis to the femur region.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes the pelvis and supports hindlimb motion.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Keep joints stable and aligned.  
- **Control:** Limit excessive motion to prevent injury.  
- **Shock absorption:** Help protect bones and joints during movement.  
- **Stability:** Maintain posture and assist with balance.  
- **Protection:** Prevent overextension and tearing of joints and muscles.

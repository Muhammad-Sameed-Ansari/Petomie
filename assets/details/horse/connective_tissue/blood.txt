#Blood#

##Location##
Blood circulates through the **entire body** via arteries, veins, and capillaries.  
It moves through the **heart, lungs, and all organs**, delivering oxygen and nutrients while removing waste products.

##Shape##
Blood is a **liquid connective tissue** made of **plasma (fluid)** and **cells** — mainly red and white blood cells and platelets.  
It is red because of **hemoglobin**, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells.

##Parts##

###1. Plasma###
- The clear, yellowish liquid part of blood.  
- **Function:** Carries nutrients, hormones, proteins, and waste products.  

###2. Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)###
- Round cells without a nucleus that contain hemoglobin.  
- **Function:** Carry oxygen from lungs to tissues and remove carbon dioxide.  

###3. White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)###
- Larger cells that protect the body from infections.  
- **Function:** Defend against bacteria, viruses, and parasites.  

###4. Platelets (Thrombocytes)###
- Small cell fragments.  
- **Function:** Help blood clot and repair damaged tissues.  

###5. Capillaries###
- Microscopic blood vessels connecting arteries and veins.  
- **Function:** Allow exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste between blood and tissues.  

###6. Arteries###
- Thick, muscular vessels carrying blood **away** from the heart.  
- **Function:** Deliver oxygen-rich blood to body tissues.  

###7. Veins###
- Thinner vessels carrying blood **back** to the heart.  
- **Function:** Return deoxygenated blood for reoxygenation in the lungs.  

##Function##
- **Transport:** Moves oxygen, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body.  
- **Waste removal:** Carries carbon dioxide and toxins to lungs and kidneys for excretion.  
- **Regulation:** Maintains temperature, pH, and hydration.  
- **Protection:** Fights infection and prevents blood loss through clotting.  
- **Energy distribution:** Supports every organ and muscle for movement and recovery.

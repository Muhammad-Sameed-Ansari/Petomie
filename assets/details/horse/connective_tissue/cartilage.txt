#Cartilage#

##Location##
Cartilage is a **smooth, flexible connective tissue** found in joints, ears, nose, ribs, larynx, and trachea of horses.  
It acts as a cushion between bones and supports smooth, friction-free movement.

##Shape##
It appears as **shiny, white-blue tissue** that is slightly flexible.  
Cartilage has no blood supply and receives nutrients through diffusion, so it heals slowly after injury.

##Parts (Types of Cartilage)##

###1. Hyaline Cartilage###
- Found in joints, nose, ribs, and trachea.  
- **Function:** Provides smooth surfaces for joint movement and helps shape flexible structures.  

###2. Elastic Cartilage###
- Found in the ear and parts of the larynx.  
- **Function:** Offers flexibility and elasticity while maintaining structure.  

###3. Fibrocartilage###
- Found in intervertebral discs and joint capsules.  
- **Function:** Absorbs shock and provides strength in high-pressure areas.  

##Function##
- **Cushioning:** Reduces friction between bones.  
- **Support:** Provides shape and structure for flexible areas.  
- **Shock absorption:** Protects bones and joints during movement.  
- **Protection:** Reduces wear and tear on joints.

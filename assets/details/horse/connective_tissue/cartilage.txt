#Cartilage#

Cartilage is a flexible connective tissue found in joints, ears, and other structures.  
It provides smooth movement, shape, and support without the rigidity of bone.  
Energetically, it represents **flexibility, adaptability, and balanced strength**.

###Parts###

##Hyaline Cartilage##  
Smooth tissue at joint surfaces reducing friction.  
Energetically, it symbolizes ease and flow in connection.

##Elastic Cartilage##  
Provides flexibility and shape, found in ears and nose.  
Energetically, it reflects resilience and light-heartedness.

##Fibrocartilage##  
Dense and strong, found in discs and ligaments.  
Energetically, it embodies endurance and grounded stability.

###Function###  
Cartilage cushions joints, absorbs shock, and supports structure.  
Energetically, it maintains **balance between movement and stability**, enabling grace and flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Joint stiffness: dehydration or rigidity in thoughts.  
Cartilage wear: aging or emotional overuse.  
Inflammation: inner friction or irritation.  
Energetic blockage: resistance to flexibility.

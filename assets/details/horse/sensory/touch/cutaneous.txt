#Cutaneous Hearing#

The horse’s cutaneous hearing refers to its ability to sense sound and vibration through the skin.  
Tiny nerve endings and hair receptors detect subtle air and ground vibrations, enhancing awareness.  
Energetically, it represents sensitivity, empathy, and intuitive listening — feeling the world through presence.

###Parts###

##Skin Receptors##  
Detect vibration, temperature, and touch changes.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness and connection to the environment.

##Hair Follicles##  
Respond to air movement and sound waves.  
Energetically, they reflect sensitivity and communication through subtle signals.

##Fascial Layers##  
Transmit vibration across the body.  
Energetically, they embody resonance and unity between body and surroundings.

###Function###  
Cutaneous hearing allows the horse to sense movement and sound vibrations before they are audible.  
It supports survival, communication, and trust through heightened awareness.  
Energetically, it expands perception, blending feeling and listening into one harmonious sense.

###Common Imbalances###  
Hypersensitivity: overstimulation or nervous tension.  
Dullness: blocked awareness or reduced sensitivity.  
Uneven reaction: imbalance in energy flow or tension in fascia.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect emotional overload, fear, or disconnection from intuitive awareness.

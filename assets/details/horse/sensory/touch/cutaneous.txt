#Cutaneous Hearing Structures#

##Location##
The outer and middle ear are located on either side of the horse’s head. 
They include the pinna (ear flap), ear canal, and tympanic membrane (eardrum), all designed to collect and transmit sound.

###Shape###
- Pinna: Large, upright, mobile ear flap.  
- Ear Canal: Curved tunnel that leads to the eardrum.  
- Eardrum: Thin membrane separating outer and middle ear.  
- Ossicles: Three small bones — malleus, incus, stapes — connecting the eardrum to the inner ear.

##Function##
- The pinna moves to locate sounds.  
- The ear canal directs sound waves to the eardrum.  
- The eardrum and ossicles convert sound waves into vibrations.  
- Provides protection and early sound filtering.

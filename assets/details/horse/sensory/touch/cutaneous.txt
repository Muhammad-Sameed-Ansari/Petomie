#Cutaneous Touch#

The horse’s cutaneous touch system involves sensation through the skin, coat, muzzle, mane, and surface nerve endings.  
It allows the horse to feel pressure, temperature, insects, pain, and subtle environmental contact.  
Energetically, it represents **safety, boundaries, herd bonding, and environmental awareness**.

###Parts###

##Skin Receptors##  
Detect pressure, temperature, pain, and light touch.  
Energetically, symbolize **sensitivity, protection, and perception of the outside world**.

##Hair Follicles##  
Sense air movement, insects, and subtle vibrations through the coat.  
Energetically, represent **alertness and environmental awareness**.

##Muzzle & Lips##  
Highly sensitive tactile areas used for exploration and social bonding.  
Energetically, symbolize **trust, curiosity, and connection**.

##Whiskers (Vibrissae)##  
Detect objects, air flow, and spatial boundaries around the face.  
Energetically, symbolize **intuition and energetic boundaries**.

##Hoof & Skin Nerves##  
Transmit touch and vibration from the ground and body surface.  
Energetically, represent **grounding and physical awareness**.

###Function###  
Cutaneous touch allows the horse to sense contact, insects, temperature, pain, and social touch.  
It supports grooming, bonding, protection, and environmental awareness.  
Energetically, it supports **trust, safety, and connection within the herd and environment**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overstimulation: touch sensitivity, reactivity, fear.

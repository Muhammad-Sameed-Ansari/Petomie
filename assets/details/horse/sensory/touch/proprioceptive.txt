#Proprioceptive Hearing#

The horse’s proprioceptive hearing combines internal sensing with vibration awareness.  
It interprets subtle sound and motion through muscles, joints, and bones, creating a whole-body sense of orientation.  
Energetically, it represents inner balance, intuition, and grounded awareness — hearing through presence and motion.

###Parts###

##Muscle Spindles##  
Detect changes in muscle tension and vibration.  
Energetically, they symbolize responsiveness and self-awareness.

##Joint Receptors##  
Sense pressure and alignment in movement.  
Energetically, they reflect inner harmony and structure.

##Fascial and Skeletal Resonance##  
Transmit vibration throughout the body.  
Energetically, they embody connection, flow, and embodiment of awareness.

###Function###  
Proprioceptive hearing integrates sound, motion, and balance, allowing the horse to react gracefully and stay centered.  
It links physical alignment with intuitive sensing, grounding the horse in its body.  
Energetically, it harmonizes physical stability with spiritual perception — the sound of stillness within movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: disrupted movement or stiffness.  
Instability: imbalance in coordination or awareness.  
Numbness: reduced body connection or energy flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of inner balance, disconnection from the body, or overstimulation.

#Proprioceptive Hearing Structures#

##Location##
Deep inside the temporal bone of the skull lies the inner ear, which includes the cochlea and vestibular system.  

###Shape###
- Cochlea: Spiral, snail-shaped structure that interprets sound frequency and volume.  
- Vestibular Apparatus: Fluid-filled canals that detect movement and position.  
- Auditory Nerve: Connects the inner ear to the brain.

##Function##
- Converts mechanical vibrations into electrical nerve signals.  
- Processes sound intensity and pitch.  
- Works with the vestibular system to maintain equilibrium.  
- Coordinates head movement and hearing precision.

#Proprioceptive Touch#

The horse’s proprioceptive touch system allows it to sense the position, movement, and tension of its own body.  
This internal body awareness supports balance, posture, coordination, and powerful movement.  
Energetically, it represents **embodiment, confidence, and physical presence**.

###Parts###

##Muscle Spindles##  
Detect muscle stretch and movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **flexibility, responsiveness, and motion awareness**.

##Tendon Organs##  
Sense force and tension in tendons.  
Energetically, represent **strength, limits, and controlled power**.

##Joint Receptors##  
Detect joint position and movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **alignment, direction, and stability**.

##Fascia##  
Connects muscles, bones, and organs, transmitting tension and movement.  
Energetically, represents **flow, integration, and energetic continuity**.

##Proprioceptive Nerves##  
Transmit position and movement information to the brain.  
Energetically, reflect **inner communication and body awareness**.

###Function###  
Proprioceptive touch allows the horse to walk, trot, canter, gallop, and balance with precision.  
It supports posture, coordination, athletic performance, and injury prevention.  
Energetically, it creates **grounding, confidence, and trust in the body**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivation: tension, rigidity, restlessness.  
Underactivation: stumbling, insecurity, poor coordination.

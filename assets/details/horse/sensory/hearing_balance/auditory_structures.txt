#Auditory Structures#

The horse’s auditory structures allow perception of sound, vibration, and direction.  
They are finely tuned to detect subtle noises, aiding communication and awareness of the environment.  
Energetically, they represent listening, intuition, and sensitivity to both external and inner worlds.

###Parts###

##Outer Ear (Pinna)##  
Large, movable ears that capture and direct sound waves.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness, curiosity, and openness to receive.

##Middle Ear##  
Contains the eardrum and small ossicles that amplify sound vibrations.  
Energetically, it represents balance between perception and understanding.

##Inner Ear##  
Houses the cochlea and auditory nerve, translating vibration into perception.  
Energetically, it reflects deep listening and intuitive knowing.

###Function###  
The auditory structures collect, amplify, and process sound, helping the horse navigate its surroundings and communicate with others.  
Energetically, they connect outer awareness with inner calm, bridging hearing with emotional sensitivity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Hypersensitivity: overstimulation or stress.  
Hearing loss: blocked perception or aging.  
Infection or inflammation: imbalance in energy flow or immunity.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect resistance to listening, fear, or emotional overwhelm.

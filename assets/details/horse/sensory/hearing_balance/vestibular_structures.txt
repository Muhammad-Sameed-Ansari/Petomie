#Vestibular Structures#

##Location##
The vestibular system is located in the inner ear, deep within the temporal bone of the skull, next to the cochlea (hearing organ). 
It connects to the brainstem and cerebellum via the vestibular nerve and interacts with the eyes, neck, and limbs to maintain posture and balance. 
This system works together with the visual and proprioceptive systems to coordinate body movement and spatial orientation.

###Shape###
The vestibular system consists of fluid-filled structures that detect head movement and position:  
- Semicircular Canals: Three loop-shaped tubes arranged at right angles, detecting rotational movements of the head.  
- Vestibule: The central chamber connecting the canals, containing two sacs:  
  - Utricle: Detects horizontal movement (forward, backward, side to side).  
  - Saccule: Detects vertical movement (up and down).  
- Hair Cells (Mechanoreceptors): Sensory cells that sense fluid motion inside the canals and send electrical signals to the brain.  
- Vestibular Nerve: Carries balance information from the inner ear to the brain for processing.

##Function##
- Detects head position, acceleration, and movement in all directions.  
- Works with the eyes and muscles to maintain posture, coordination, and stability.  
- Allows smooth movement while walking, running, turning, or grazing.  
- Adjusts body alignment and head position to maintain balance, especially during motion.  
- Helps the horse stay steady during riding, jumping, and quick changes in direction.  

A healthy vestibular system allows horses to move fluidly and stay balanced, even during complex movements.

###Energetic Connection###

- **Meridian Connections:** Kidney and Bladder Meridians – stability, adaptability, and energetic flow.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents balance and centeredness, both physically and emotionally.  
  - Imbalance may appear as tension, confusion, loss of confidence, or poor coordination.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm focus, graceful motion, and trust in movement.  
- **Energetic Support:**  
  - Grounding activities like walking on varied terrain.  
  - Calm environments with rhythmic sounds or movement.  
  - Gentle stretching and massage around the neck and poll to maintain energy flow.

#Vestibular Structures#

The horse’s vestibular structures, located in the inner ear, control balance, coordination, and spatial orientation.  
They help maintain equilibrium during motion and stillness.  
Energetically, they represent harmony, grounding, and stability within change.

###Parts###

##Semicircular Canals##  
Detect head rotation and direction of movement.  
Energetically, they symbolize adaptability and flow in shifting circumstances.

##Utricle and Saccule##  
Sense gravity and linear acceleration.  
Energetically, they represent grounding and balance between motion and rest.

##Vestibular Nerve##  
Carries signals to the brain to coordinate movement and posture.  
Energetically, it reflects connection, clarity, and alignment.

###Function###  
The vestibular structures maintain balance and coordinate movement with visual and muscular input.  
Energetically, they sustain the horse’s centered awareness and trust in motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Loss of balance: inner ear dysfunction or disorientation.  
Head tilt: vestibular disturbance or nerve irritation.  
Dizziness: infection or stress.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect confusion, instability, or lack of grounding.

#Gustatory (Taste) System#

##Location##
The taste system is located primarily on the **tongue** and within the **oral cavity**. 
Taste buds are found on the surface of the tongue, soft palate, and throat. 
They connect to the brain via the **facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves**.

###Shape###
The **tongue** is a muscular, flexible organ covered in small projections called **papillae**. 
Some papillae contain **taste buds**, which are groups of sensory cells shaped like small bulbs that detect chemicals in food and water.

##Function##
- Taste buds detect the five main taste sensations: **sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami**.  
- Chemical molecules from food dissolve in saliva and interact with taste receptor cells.  
- These cells send electrical signals through nerves to the brain, identifying flavor and safety.  
- Taste works with **smell** to form overall flavor perception.  
- Horses use taste to select safe, palatable forage and avoid toxic plants.  

Horses are selective grazers with a strong preference for **sweet and salty** flavors.

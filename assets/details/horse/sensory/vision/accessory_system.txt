#Accessory Structures#

The horse’s accessory structures include supporting parts that protect, enhance, and maintain bodily functions.  
These include hair, hooves, glands, and connective tissues that help regulate balance, temperature, and protection.  
Energetically, they represent boundaries, resilience, and the outer reflection of inner vitality.

###Parts###

##Hair and Coat##  
Provide insulation, protection, and sensory awareness.  
Energetically, they symbolize sensitivity and energetic shielding.

##Hooves##  
Support movement and grounding, absorbing shock and connecting the horse to the Earth.  
Energetically, they represent stability and rooted strength.

##Glands (Sebaceous and Sweat)##  
Maintain hydration and regulate body temperature.  
Energetically, they reflect flow and balance within the body’s surface energy.

##Connective Tissue##  
Holds and supports organs, muscles, and bones.  
Energetically, it embodies unity, flexibility, and strength through connection.

###Function###  
Accessory structures protect, stabilize, and assist all major systems.  
They ensure adaptability, comfort, and sensory awareness.  
Energetically, they act as protectors and communicators between the inner and outer worlds.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dry skin or brittle coat: dehydration or energy stagnation.  
Cracked hooves: imbalance in nutrition or grounding.  
Excess sweating: stress or energetic overload.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect weak boundaries or overexposure to external energy.

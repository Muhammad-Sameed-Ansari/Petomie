#Accessory Structures#

##Location##
Accessory structures surround and support the eyes. 
They include the eyelids, eyelashes, third eyelid (nictitating membrane), lacrimal glands, tear ducts, conjunctiva, and the muscles that move the eye within the orbit.

###Shape###
- **Eyelids:** Thin folds of skin lined with muscle and mucous membrane.  
- **Eyelashes:** Long protective hairs along the upper eyelid.  
- **Third Eyelid:** A thin membrane in the inner corner of the eye that moves horizontally.  
- **Lacrimal Apparatus:** Tear-producing glands with ducts that drain into the nasal cavity.  
- **Extraocular Muscles:** Six small muscles that control eye movement in all directions.  
- **Conjunctiva:** A transparent membrane covering the inner eyelids and white of the eye.

##Function##
- **Eyelids and Eyelashes:** Protect the eye from debris, light, and injury.  
- **Third Eyelid:** Sweeps across the eye for cleaning and extra protection.  
- **Lacrimal Glands and Ducts:** Produce and drain tears that clean, lubricate, and protect the cornea.  
- **Extraocular Muscles:** Allow coordinated eye movement and focus.  
- **Conjunctiva:** Keeps the eye moist and free from infection.  

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Third Eye and Throat Chakras – clarity, communication, and intuitive awareness.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Liver and Stomach Meridians – focus and emotional expression.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represent protection of vision and sensitivity to surroundings. Imbalance may lead to irritability, excessive tearing, or avoidance.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm perception and clear emotional sight.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle eye care, calm lighting, and trust-based interaction help maintain clarity and comfort.

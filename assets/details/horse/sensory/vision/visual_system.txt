#Main Structures#

##Location##
The eyes are located on the sides of the horse’s head, allowing a nearly 350° field of view. 
Each eye is housed in a bony socket (orbit) and protected by surrounding bone and tissue. 
The optic nerve connects each eye to the brain’s visual center in the occipital lobe.

###Shape###
Large, spherical organs with dark reflective surfaces. 
The outer layer (cornea and sclera) provides strength and transparency, while the inner layers (iris, lens, retina, and choroid) focus and process light.

##Function##
- The **cornea** and **lens** bend (refract) light to focus it onto the **retina**.  
- The **iris** controls the pupil’s size to adjust for light intensity.  
- The **retina** converts light into electrical impulses using **rods and cones**.  
  - Rods detect brightness and motion.  
  - Cones detect color, mainly blue and yellow hues.  
- The **optic nerve** transmits these signals to the brain, creating vision.  
- The **tapetum lucidum**, a reflective layer behind the retina, enhances night vision.  
- The **choroid** supplies blood and nutrients to the retina.  

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Third Eye Chakra – perception, awareness, and insight.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Liver and Gallbladder – clarity, vision, and direction.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Vision reflects understanding and the ability to see truth. Imbalances can show as anxiety, difficulty focusing, or resistance to change.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm alertness, clear perception, and intuitive seeing.  
- **Energetic Support:** Soft lighting, relaxed environments, and gentle contact around the eyes help maintain balance.

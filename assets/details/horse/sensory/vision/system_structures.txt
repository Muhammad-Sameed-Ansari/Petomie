#System Structures#

The horse’s system structures form the framework connecting all organs, tissues, and energetic centers.  
They coordinate the body’s physical and energetic flow, maintaining harmony between movement, function, and awareness.  
Energetically, they represent unity, integration, and communication — the orchestra of life within the horse.

###Parts###

##Skeletal Framework##  
Provides structure, stability, and alignment.  
Energetically, it symbolizes foundation and purpose.

##Muscular and Fascial Networks##  
Create motion and transmit energy throughout the body.  
Energetically, they reflect flow, adaptability, and strength in connection.

##Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems##  
Deliver nutrients, remove waste, and maintain vitality.  
Energetically, they represent balance and renewal through movement.

##Energetic Pathways (Meridians, Chakras, Fields)##  
Link physical structures with emotional and spiritual flow.  
Energetically, they embody communication, healing, and connection to life force.

###Function###  
System structures integrate all body functions, ensuring smooth communication between organs and energies.  
They maintain balance between stability and movement, grounding and flow.  
Energetically, they unify body, mind, and spirit, creating inner harmony and resilience.

###Common Imbalances###  
Fatigue: disrupted energy communication.  
Muscle tension: blocked flow or imbalance.  
Poor circulation: stagnation or weakness.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disconnection between systems or disharmony between physical and energetic layers.

#System Structures#

The horse’s visual system structures detect light, process visual information, and transmit signals to the brain.
They support panoramic vision, motion detection, and environmental awareness.
Energetically, they represent perception, instinct, interpretation, and survival intelligence.

###Parts###

##Retina##
The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.
Converts light into neural signals.
Energetically, represents perception and awareness.

##Rods##
Photoreceptors specialized for low-light and motion detection.
Highly developed in horses.
Energetically, symbolize sensitivity and instinct.

##Cones##
Photoreceptors responsible for color and detail.
Horses primarily perceive blue and yellow hues.
Energetically, represent discernment and clarity.

##Optic Disc##
The exit point of the optic nerve from the retina.
Energetically, symbolizes transition and integration.

##Optic Nerve##
Transmits visual information from the eye to the brain.
Energetically, represents communication and trust.

##Optic Chiasm##
Crossing of optic nerve fibers allowing coordination between both eyes.
Energetically, reflects balance and integration.

##Optic Tract##
Carries visual signals toward the brain.
Energetically, symbolizes direction and continuity.

##Lateral Geniculate Nucleus##
Processes visual signals within the thalamus.
Energetically, represents filtering and interpretation.

##Visual Cortex##
Located in the occipital lobe.
Interprets visual information into meaning.
Energetically, symbolizes understanding and awareness.

###Function###
Receive light, convert it into neural signals, process motion and space, and interpret the environment.
Energetically, these structures support orientation, instinctual safety, and confident movement.

###Common Imbalances###
Vision impairment, night vision issues, neurological visual disturbances.
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disorientation, fear responses, or difficulty interpreting surroundings.

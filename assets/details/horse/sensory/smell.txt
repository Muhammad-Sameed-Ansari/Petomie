#Smell System#

The horse’s smell system is highly developed, allowing recognition of scents, emotions, and energy in the environment.  
It plays a vital role in social interaction, food selection, and safety.  
Energetically, it represents intuition, memory, and emotional connection — sensing beyond words and form.

###Parts###

##Nostrils##  
Large and flexible, guiding air and scent into the nasal passages.  
Energetically, they symbolize openness and awareness of subtle changes.

##Nasal Cavity##  
Filters, warms, and channels air toward the olfactory region.  
Energetically, it represents preparation and balance in perception.

##Olfactory Epithelium##  
Contains sensory cells that detect thousands of scents.  
Energetically, it reflects sensitivity and intuitive awareness.

##Olfactory Bulb##  
Processes scent signals and connects them to emotion and memory.  
Energetically, it symbolizes instinctive knowing and emotional resonance.

###Function###  
The smell system allows the horse to recognize familiar beings, detect food, and sense environmental shifts.  
It links scent with memory and emotion, guiding behavior through intuitive awareness.  
Energetically, it deepens connection with surroundings and others, anchoring instinct to heart and spirit.

###Common Imbalances###  
Reduced sense: sinus congestion or infection.  
Overreaction: irritation or sensitivity to smells.  
Blocked breathing: nasal obstruction or inflammation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect confusion, emotional numbness, or disconnection from intuition.

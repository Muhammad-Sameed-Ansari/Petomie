#Olfactory (Smell) System#

##Location##
The olfactory system is located in the **nasal cavity**, behind the nostrils and above the roof of the mouth. 
It connects to the **olfactory bulb** in the brain through the **olfactory nerves**. 
Horses also have a **vomeronasal organ (Jacobson’s organ)** in the nasal septum, used for sensing pheromones and emotional signals.

###Shape###
- **Nostrils (Nares):** Large, flexible openings that draw air into the nasal cavity.  
- **Nasal Cavity:** Lined with folded bony structures called **turbinates**, covered in olfactory epithelium rich in sensory cells.  
- **Olfactory Bulb:** A structure at the front of the brain that processes scent information.  
- **Vomeronasal Organ:** Small paired sensory organ near the nasal floor.  

##Function##
- Air enters through the nostrils and passes over the olfactory epithelium.  
- **Olfactory receptors** detect scent molecules and send electrical signals to the brain.  
- The brain interprets these signals as smell, helping identify food, other animals, humans, and danger.  
- The **vomeronasal organ** detects pheromones and social cues.  
- Horses use scent for **communication, recognition, and emotional awareness**.  

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Root and Sacral Chakras – instinct, safety, and connection to the environment.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Lung and Large Intestine Meridians – breath, clarity, and release.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents awareness and instinctive trust in surroundings. Imbalance may show as nervousness or over-alertness.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm curiosity and intuitive sensing.  
- **Energetic Support:** Fresh air, natural scents, and calm environments enhance balance and relaxation.

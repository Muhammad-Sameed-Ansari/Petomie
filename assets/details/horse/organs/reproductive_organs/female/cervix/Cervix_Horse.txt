#Cervix#

##Location##
Located at the junction between the uterus and vagina within the pelvic cavity. In the mare, the cervix lies horizontally and serves as the passageway between the uterine body and the vaginal canal.

##Shape##
A thick, muscular, tubular structure composed of dense connective tissue and smooth muscle:
- **Cervical Canal:** Central passage lined with longitudinal folds that vary in shape depending on the reproductive cycle.
- **Internal Os:** Opening connecting the cervix to the uterine body.
- **External Os:** Opening connecting the cervix to the vagina.
- **Mucosal Folds:** Prominent ridges that relax during estrus and close tightly during diestrus and pregnancy.
- **Glandular Epithelium:** Secretes mucus that changes consistency with hormonal fluctuations.

##Function##
Regulates passage between the uterus and vagina
Protects the uterus from contamination and ascending infections
Secretes mucus to lubricate and create a barrier during different reproductive phases
Relaxes during estrus to permit sperm entry and tightens during pregnancy to maintain uterine closure
Plays a critical role in parturition by dilating for foal delivery

#Ovaries#

##Location##
Situated within the abdominal cavity, just below the fifth lumbar vertebra, near the ends of the uterine horns. The mare’s ovaries lie slightly behind the kidneys and are suspended by the mesovarium, part of the broad ligament of the uterus.

##Shape##
Large, bean-shaped organs that vary in size and texture depending on reproductive status:
- **Outer Cortex:** Contains follicles and corpora lutea; unlike most species, the mare’s cortex is located internally, while the medulla lies on the surface.
- **Inner Medulla:** Contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.
- **Ovulation Fossa:** A unique depression on the ovary’s surface where ovulation exclusively occurs.
- **Follicles:** Fluid-filled structures that mature and release ova (eggs).
- **Corpus Luteum:** Temporary gland formed after ovulation, producing progesterone.

##Function##
Produces ova (eggs) for fertilization
Secretes reproductive hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin
Regulates the estrous cycle and sexual receptivity
Supports early pregnancy through hormone production until placental function is established
Coordinates with pituitary hormones (FSH and LH) for follicle development and ovulation

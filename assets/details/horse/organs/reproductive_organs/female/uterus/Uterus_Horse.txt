#Uterus#

##Location##
Located within the pelvic and abdominal cavities, suspended by the broad ligament. In the mare, the uterus lies between the bladder and rectum and connects cranially to the uterine horns and caudally to the cervix.

##Shape##
A Y-shaped, hollow muscular organ composed of three main parts:
- **Uterine Body:** Central portion leading to the cervix; short in the mare compared to other species.
- **Uterine Horns:** Two long, gently curved extensions that connect to the oviducts (fallopian tubes) and serve as the site of embryo development and placentation.
- **Endometrium:** Inner mucosal layer rich in glands that secrete nutrients for embryo support.
- **Myometrium:** Middle muscular layer responsible for uterine contractions during estrus and parturition.
- **Perimetrium:** Outer serous covering continuous with the peritoneum.

##Function##
Serves as the site for embryo implantation and fetal development
Supports pregnancy through nourishment and hormonal interaction with the placenta
Contracts to expel the fetus and placenta during parturition
Provides a protective and sterile environment for the developing embryo
Participates in the estrous cycle through hormonal and structural changes

#Vagina#

##Location##
Located within the pelvic cavity, extending from the cervix of the uterus to the external urethral orifice and vulva. In the mare, it lies dorsal to the urethra and ventral to the rectum, forming part of the birth canal and reproductive tract.

##Shape##
A distensible, muscular tube composed of mucosal, muscular, and fibrous layers:
- **Mucosal Layer:** Lined with stratified squamous epithelium that becomes thicker during estrus.
- **Muscular Layer:** Smooth muscle fibers arranged circularly and longitudinally for flexibility and strength during mating and parturition.
- **Vestibulovaginal Junction:** Caudal region where the vagina joins the vestibule near the hymen-like fold.
- **Vaginal Fornix:** Shallow recess formed around the cervical opening.
- **Connective Tissue Support:** Anchors the vagina to surrounding pelvic structures for stability.

##Function##
Serves as the copulatory organ during mating
Acts as the passageway for semen deposition and foal delivery
Provides a protective barrier to prevent ascending infections into the uterus
Facilitates drainage of uterine secretions during the estrous cycle
Adapts in elasticity and tone to accommodate parturition and breeding

#Uterine Tubes#

##Location##
Located in the upper region of the reproductive tract, extending from the ovaries to the uterine horns. Each uterine tube (also called the oviduct or fallopian tube) lies within the mesosalpinx, a portion of the broad ligament that suspends it in the abdominal cavity.

##Shape##
Slender, convoluted tubular structures approximately 20–30 cm long, consisting of several regions:
- **Infundibulum:** Funnel-shaped opening near the ovary, fringed with fimbriae that capture the released oocyte during ovulation.
- **Ampulla:** Wider, coiled midsection where fertilization typically occurs.
- **Isthmus:** Narrow segment connecting the ampulla to the uterine horn, regulating passage of sperm and embryo.
- **Mucosal Folds:** Ciliated epithelium lining the tube, aiding in gamete and embryo transport.

##Function##
Transports ova from the ovary to the uterus
Provides the site of fertilization between sperm and oocyte
Secretes nourishing fluids that support gametes and early embryo development
Regulates the movement of the fertilized ovum into the uterus for implantation
Acts as a selective barrier to prevent unfertilized or abnormal ova from entering the uterus

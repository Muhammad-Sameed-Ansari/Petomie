#Testes#

##Location##
Located within the scrotum, which lies outside the abdominal cavity and ventral to the anus. The scrotum provides a cooler environment necessary for sperm production. Each testis is suspended by its own spermatic cord containing vessels, nerves, and the ductus deferens.

##Shape##
Oval, flattened organs with smooth surfaces enclosed by protective layers:
- **Tunica Vaginalis:** Serous membrane derived from the peritoneum surrounding the testis.
- **Tunica Albuginea:** Dense fibrous capsule covering the testis, sending septa inward to form lobules.
- **Seminiferous Tubules:** Highly coiled structures within lobules where spermatogenesis occurs.
- **Rete Testis:** Network of channels collecting sperm from seminiferous tubules.
- **Efferent Ductules:** Small ducts transporting sperm to the epididymis.
- **Interstitial (Leydig) Cells:** Located between tubules; secrete testosterone for male secondary characteristics and sperm maturation.

##Function##
Produces spermatozoa for reproduction
Secretes testosterone, supporting libido and male sexual development
Maintains optimal temperature for sperm production through scrotal thermoregulation
Coordinates with accessory glands and epididymis for sperm maturation and delivery
Acts as the primary endocrine and reproductive organ of the male horse

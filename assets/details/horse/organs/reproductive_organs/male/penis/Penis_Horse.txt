#Penis#

##Location##
Located in the ventral midline of the pelvic and perineal regions, housed within the prepuce when retracted. The penis of the stallion extends from the ischial arch to the external urethral orifice at the tip of the glans.

##Shape##
Composed of erectile and connective tissues organized into three main parts:
- **Root:** Attached portion anchored to the ischial arch by the crura and bulb of the penis.
- **Body (Shaft):** Cylindrical middle section composed of paired corpora cavernosa and a single corpus spongiosum surrounding the urethra.
- **Glans Penis:** Expanded, mushroom-shaped distal end containing the urethral process and rich sensory innervation.
- **Prepuce (Sheath):** Double fold of skin enclosing the non-erect penis, providing protection and lubrication.
- **Retractor Penis Muscle:** Smooth muscle that retracts the penis into the sheath after erection or urination.

##Function##
Serves as the copulatory organ for sperm deposition during mating
Conducts urine from the bladder to the exterior through the urethra
Engorges with blood during erection to facilitate intromission
Contains sensory structures that trigger ejaculation and mating behavior
Provides protection to reproductive tissues when retracted within the prepuce

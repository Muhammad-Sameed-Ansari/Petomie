#Epididymis#

##Location##
Lies along the dorsolateral surface of each testis within the scrotum. It is attached to the testis by connective tissue and continues as the ductus (vas) deferens at its tail end. The epididymis is enclosed within the tunica vaginalis alongside the testis.

##Shape##
A long, highly coiled tubular structure divided into three distinct regions:
- **Head (Caput):** Broad cranial portion receiving sperm from the efferent ductules of the testis.
- **Body (Corpus):** Elongated middle region where sperm mature and gain motility.
- **Tail (Cauda):** Enlarged distal portion serving as a storage site for mature sperm before ejaculation.
- **Duct of Epididymis:** Single, continuous, tightly coiled duct extending the full length of the organ, lined with stereociliated epithelium for absorption and secretion.

##Function##
Stores and matures spermatozoa after they leave the testes
Provides an environment for sperm to acquire motility and fertilizing ability
Transports sperm to the vas deferens during ejaculation
Absorbs testicular fluid and secretes nutrients to sustain sperm health
Acts as a reservoir regulating sperm availability for reproduction

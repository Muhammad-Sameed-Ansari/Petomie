#Vas Deferens#

##Location##
Extends from the tail of the epididymis through the spermatic cord, passing through the inguinal canal into the pelvic cavity where it joins the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct that opens into the urethra.

##Shape##
A narrow, muscular tube with a thick wall composed of smooth muscle layers:
- **Initial Segment:** Continuation of the epididymal duct, ascending within the spermatic cord alongside blood vessels and nerves.
- **Pelvic Portion:** Straightens and enlarges before reaching the neck of the bladder.
- **Ampulla:** Terminal enlargement near the junction with the seminal vesicle, functioning as a storage site for sperm.
- **Lumen:** Lined with ciliated and secretory epithelium aiding sperm transport and nourishment.

##Function##
Transports mature sperm from the epididymis to the urethra during ejaculation
Stores sperm temporarily within the ampulla
Contracts rhythmically to propel sperm during mating
Contributes secretions that maintain sperm viability and motility
Serves as a conduit connecting the testes to the male reproductive tract

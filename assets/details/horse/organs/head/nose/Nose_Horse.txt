#Nose#

##Location##
Located at the front of the face, forming the external opening of the respiratory tract. In the horse, the nose consists of two large nostrils (nares) supported by flexible cartilage and surrounded by soft tissues. It leads into the nasal cavity, which extends back to the pharynx.

##Shape##
Composed of cartilaginous and soft tissue structures designed for airflow and filtration:
- **External Nares (Nostrils):** Large, oval openings capable of wide dilation during exercise to increase airflow.
- **Ala Nasi (Nostril Wings):** Mobile lateral flaps controlled by facial muscles to adjust nostril size.
- **Nasal Septum:** Divides the nasal cavity into right and left halves; composed of cartilage rostrally and bone caudally.
- **Nasal Cavities:** Lined with mucous membranes containing cilia and mucus-secreting glands for air filtration and humidification.
- **Turbinates (Conchae):** Curved bony plates increasing the surface area for warming, filtering, and moistening incoming air.
- **Nasal Cartilages:** Provide flexibility and structural support to maintain airway patency during breathing.

##Function##
Serves as the primary airway for inhalation and exhalation
Filters, warms, and humidifies inspired air before it reaches the lungs
Detects odors through olfactory receptors in the nasal mucosa
Assists in vocal resonance and pressure equalization
Protects lower airways by trapping dust and debris in nasal mucus

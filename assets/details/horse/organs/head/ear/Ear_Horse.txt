#Ear#

##Location##
Situated on the top of the head, one on each side, just behind the eyes. The horse’s ears are highly mobile and capable of independent rotation, allowing detection of sounds from multiple directions. They form the external entry to the auditory system.

##Shape##
Divided into three main regions with distinct structures:
- **External Ear:** Includes the pinna (auricle) and external auditory canal. The pinna is tall, funnel-shaped, and covered with fine hair, designed to capture and direct sound waves.
- **Middle Ear:** Contains the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and three auditory ossicles — malleus, incus, and stapes — which transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.
- **Inner Ear:** Contains the cochlea (for hearing) and vestibular apparatus (for balance). It is housed within the temporal bone and filled with fluid for sensory transduction.
- **Auricular Muscles:** Numerous small muscles at the ear base enable fine-tuned movement and positioning for sound localization.

##Function##
Detects and directs sound waves into the auditory canal
Amplifies and transmits vibrations from the eardrum to the cochlea
Assists in balance and spatial orientation through vestibular feedback
Expresses mood and attention, aiding in communication and behavioral cues
Protects the auditory canal from debris and insects through hair and wax secretion

#Head – Brain#

##Location##
The brain is located inside the **skull**, protected by the **cranial bones** and surrounded by **cerebrospinal fluid**.  
It connects to the **spinal cord** through the **brainstem** and is the control center for all physical, emotional, and instinctive actions.

###Shape###
A soft, folded organ divided into several parts:  
- **Cerebrum:** controls thought, movement, and awareness.  
- **Cerebellum:** coordinates balance, posture, and movement precision.  
- **Brainstem:** manages basic life functions such as breathing, heart rate, and reflexes.  
The brain’s surface is covered in grooves (gyri and sulci) that increase surface area for nerve connections.

##Function##
- **Processes information** from all senses — sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.  
- Controls **movement, coordination, balance, and emotional responses**.  
- Regulates **heartbeat, breathing, and body temperature** automatically.  
- Forms and stores **memories and learned behaviors**.  
- Connects the horse’s physical actions with emotional and energetic states.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) and Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) — centers of consciousness, intuition, and higher awareness.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Governing Vessel (Du Mai) — runs along the midline of the back and connects all Yang energy in the body.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The brain represents **understanding, awareness, and connection between thought and instinct**.  
  - Imbalance may lead to confusion, disconnection, overthinking, or emotional reactivity.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Mental clarity, focus, trust in intuition, and a calm mind-body connection.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle poll massage, craniosacral therapy, Reiki over the forehead and crown, and time in quiet surroundings enhance harmony and mental balance.

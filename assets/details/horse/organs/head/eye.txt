#Head – Eye#

##Location##
The eyes are located on the **sides of the horse’s head**, giving a **very wide field of vision** — nearly 350 degrees.  
This placement allows the horse to see danger from almost all directions, while still having a small blind spot directly in front of the nose and behind the tail.  
Each eye sits within a **bony socket (orbit)**, protected by **eyelids**, **eyelashes**, and a **third eyelid (nictitating membrane)** that sweeps across the eye for protection and moisture.

###Shape###
Large, rounded organs with several key structures:  
- **Cornea:** clear front surface that lets light enter.  
- **Iris:** colored ring that controls how much light enters.  
- **Lens:** focuses light onto the retina.  
- **Retina:** layer of light-sensitive cells that send signals through the **optic nerve** to the brain.  
Horses have many **rod cells** for night vision and motion detection, and fewer **cone cells**, so they see fewer colors but perceive movement extremely well.

##Function##
- Provides **wide-angle vision** to detect predators or movement.  
- Detects **light, distance, shape, and motion**.  
- Adjusts to different light conditions quickly through iris movement.  
- The **third eyelid** keeps the eye clean and lubricated.  
- Essential for **spatial awareness, coordination, and emotional expression** — horses communicate much through their eyes.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) — governs perception, intuition, and awareness.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Liver Meridian (controls the eyes and visual clarity) and Gallbladder Meridian (side vision, focus, and direction).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The eyes represent **how one views life and experiences truth**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as fear of seeing, avoidance, anxiety, or confusion.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm perception, open awareness, confidence in movement.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle eye contact, soft brushing around the head, natural sunlight, and calm interaction support both physical and energetic vision.

#Eye#

##Location##
Positioned laterally on each side of the head within the bony orbits of the skull. The horse’s eyes are among the largest of any land mammal, allowing an exceptionally wide field of vision—nearly 350 degrees—with only small blind spots directly in front and behind.

##Shape##
A spherical sensory organ composed of multiple transparent and pigmented layers:
- **Cornea:** Clear, dome-shaped outer layer that refracts light onto the lens.
- **Sclera:** White, fibrous outer coating providing shape and protection.
- **Iris and Pupil:** The colored diaphragm and central aperture controlling light entry.
- **Lens:** Transparent, flexible structure focusing light onto the retina.
- **Retina:** Light-sensitive inner layer containing rods (for night vision) and cones (for color and daytime vision).
- **Optic Nerve:** Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
- **Aqueous and Vitreous Humor:** Fluids that maintain intraocular pressure and optical clarity.
- **Nictitating Membrane (Third Eyelid):** Protective membrane sweeping across the eye for cleaning and lubrication.

##Function##
Captures and focuses light to form visual images
Converts light energy into nerve impulses for brain interpretation
Provides an extensive field of view for detecting predators and environmental changes
Assists in depth perception and motion detection during movement
Protects ocular surfaces through blinking, tear production, and the third eyelid

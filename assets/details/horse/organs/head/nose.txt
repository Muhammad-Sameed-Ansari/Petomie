#Head – Nose#

##Location##
The nose is located on the **front of the horse’s head**, forming the beginning of the **respiratory system**.  
It includes the **nostrils (nares)**, **nasal cavities**, and the **sinuses** behind the facial bones.  
Air passes through the nostrils into the nasal passages before reaching the **pharynx**, **larynx**, and **lungs**.

###Shape###
Two large, soft **nostrils** surrounded by flexible cartilage that expands during breathing.  
Inside are **nasal passages** lined with mucous membranes and fine hairs that **filter, warm, and humidify** the air.  
The **olfactory region**, located deep in the nasal cavity, contains smell receptors that connect to the **olfactory bulb** in the brain.

##Function##
- Allows **breathing** and **smelling** — both essential for survival and awareness.  
- **Filters and warms** incoming air before it reaches the lungs.  
- **Detects scents** in the environment, food, and other horses.  
- Plays a role in **communication**, as horses use smell to recognize individuals, emotions, and even health states.  
- The soft tissues around the nostrils also enhance **facial expression** and sensitivity.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Root Chakra (Muladhara) and Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana) — represent grounding, instinct, and emotional sensing.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Lung Meridian (breath, purity, and vitality) and Large Intestine Meridian (release and letting go).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The nose symbolizes **intuition, instinct, and connection to the environment**.  
  - Imbalance may show as irritation, shallow breathing, or over-sensitivity to smells or surroundings.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm curiosity, open breathing, and emotional connection to life.  
- **Energetic Support:** Breathing exercises, gentle massage around the muzzle, and grounding time in nature support both airflow and energy flow.

#Ear#

##Location##  
The ears are located on both sides of the head, just behind the eyes, with deep structures extending into the skull.  
They are designed to detect, direct, and interpret sound waves while assisting balance and spatial awareness.

###Shape###  
Each ear has a **movable outer pinna**, a sound-collecting funnel that rotates independently.  
Internally, the **middle ear** and **inner ear** process vibrations and sense equilibrium.

###Parts###

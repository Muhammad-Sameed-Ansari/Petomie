#Head – Ear#

##Location##
The ears are located high on the sides of the horse’s head and can **rotate almost 180 degrees** to capture sound from all directions.  
They consist of three parts — **outer, middle, and inner ear** — all working together for hearing and balance.

###Shape###
- **Outer Ear (Pinna):** funnel-shaped, made of cartilage covered by skin and fine hair; collects sound waves.  
- **Ear Canal:** carries sound to the eardrum.  
- **Middle Ear:** contains three small bones (malleus, incus, stapes) that transfer sound vibrations.  
- **Inner Ear:** includes the **cochlea** for hearing and the **vestibular apparatus** for balance and orientation.

##Function##
- Detects and identifies **sound vibrations** and their direction.  
- Assists in **balance, coordination, and awareness of body position**.  
- Ears move independently to locate subtle sounds such as footsteps, wind, or other horses’ movements.  
- Serve as a strong **communication tool**, expressing attention, curiosity, stress, or relaxation.  
- The inner ear helps the horse maintain equilibrium during motion, galloping, or turning.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) — associated with listening, communication, and truth.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Kidney Meridian (deep listening and intuition) and Small Intestine Meridian (sorting clarity from confusion).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The ears represent **how one listens to the outer world and inner guidance**.  
  - Imbalance may show as over-sensitivity to noise, refusal to listen, or nervous reactions to sound.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm focus, receptive awareness, clear emotional attunement.  
- **Energetic Support:** Calm tones, gentle grooming near the ears, and time in a peaceful environment help harmonize both hearing and energetic balance.

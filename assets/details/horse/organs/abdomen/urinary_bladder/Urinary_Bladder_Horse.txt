#Urinary Bladder#

##Location##
Situated in the pelvic cavity, ventral to the rectum and dorsal to the pubic symphysis. When distended, it can extend cranially into the abdominal cavity. It connects cranially with the ureters and caudally with the urethra.

##Shape##
A hollow, muscular, and elastic organ with distinct anatomical regions:
- **Apex:** Rounded cranial portion that expands as the bladder fills.
- **Body:** Main storage area for urine, composed of highly distensible tissue.
- **Neck:** Caudal portion leading into the urethra, containing the internal urethral sphincter.
- **Wall Layers:** Consists of mucosa (transitional epithelium), submucosa, smooth muscle (detrusor muscle), and serosa.
- **Trigone:** Triangular area between ureteral openings and internal urethral orifice, sensitive to stretch and fullness.

##Function##
Stores urine produced by the kidneys until excretion
Contracts to expel urine through the urethra during micturition
Prevents urine backflow with ureteral valve-like entry points
Regulates urinary output through neural control of the detrusor muscle and sphincters
Maintains homeostasis by coordinating temporary storage and periodic elimination of waste fluids

#Peritoneum#

##Location##
Lines the entire abdominal cavity and covers most of the abdominal organs. In the horse, the peritoneum forms a continuous, glistening membrane extending from the diaphragm to the pelvic cavity. It consists of two layers: the parietal peritoneum (lining the abdominal wall) and the visceral peritoneum (covering the organs).

##Shape##
A thin, transparent serous membrane composed of epithelial and connective tissue layers:
- **Parietal Peritoneum:** Adheres to the inner abdominal wall, diaphragm, and pelvic cavity.
- **Visceral Peritoneum:** Reflects over abdominal organs such as the stomach, liver, and intestines.
- **Peritoneal Cavity:** Potential space between layers containing a small amount of lubricating serous fluid.
- **Mesentery:** Double fold of peritoneum suspending the intestines and carrying blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.
- **Omentum and Ligaments:** Specialized folds that attach organs to each other or to the abdominal wall.

##Function##
Provides a smooth, frictionless surface for organ movement during digestion and respiration
Suspends and supports abdominal organs in position through mesenteric attachments
Allows passage of blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves to visceral organs
Acts as a protective barrier against infection and assists in immune response
Maintains fluid balance within the abdominal cavity through absorption and secretion of serous fluid

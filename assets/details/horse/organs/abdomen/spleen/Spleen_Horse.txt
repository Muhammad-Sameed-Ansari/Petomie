#Spleen#

##Location##
Located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, between the stomach and the left abdominal wall. In the horse, the spleen lies against the diaphragm and left kidney, attached to the greater curvature of the stomach by the gastrosplenic ligament.

##Shape##
A large, crescent-shaped organ with a smooth outer surface and a rich blood supply:
- **Hilus:** Medial indentation where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit.
- **Capsule:** Dense connective tissue covering that contains smooth muscle fibers enabling contraction and expansion.
- **Red Pulp:** Vascular tissue responsible for filtering and storing blood.
- **White Pulp:** Lymphoid tissue involved in immune response and antibody production.
- **Splenic Veins and Arteries:** Connect to the portal circulation for blood processing.

##Function##
Stores and releases red blood cells during physical exertion to enhance oxygen delivery
Filters and removes old or damaged red blood cells from circulation
Acts as a reservoir for platelets and immune cells
Participates in immune defense by producing lymphocytes and antibodies
Maintains blood homeostasis and supports overall circulatory health

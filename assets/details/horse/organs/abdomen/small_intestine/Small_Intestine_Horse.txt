#Small Intestine#

##Location##
Occupies the ventral and left regions of the abdominal cavity, extending from the pylorus of the stomach to the cecum. It is suspended by the mesentery, which anchors it to the dorsal abdominal wall and contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.

##Shape##
A long, coiled tubular structure approximately 20–25 meters in length, composed of three main sections:
- **Duodenum:** Short initial portion fixed along the right dorsal abdomen; receives bile and pancreatic secretions.
- **Jejunum:** Long, coiled middle segment occupying most of the ventral abdomen; primary site for nutrient absorption.
- **Ileum:** Short terminal segment connecting to the cecum via the ileocecal junction, marked by a distinct thickening of the muscular wall.
- **Mucosal Lining:** Covered with villi and microvilli to maximize nutrient absorption surface area.
- **Muscular Layers:** Circular and longitudinal smooth muscle enabling peristaltic movement.

##Function##
Continues enzymatic digestion of feed after it leaves the stomach
Absorbs nutrients including amino acids, fatty acids, sugars, and minerals
Secretes digestive enzymes and mucus for lubrication and protection
Transports digested material to the large intestine via coordinated peristalsis
Acts as a major site for water and electrolyte absorption to maintain hydration

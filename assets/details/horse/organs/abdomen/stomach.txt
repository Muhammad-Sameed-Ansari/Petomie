#Stomach#

##Location##
The stomach lies in the **upper left part of the abdomen**, just behind the diaphragm and below the ribs.  
It connects the **esophagus** to the **small intestine (duodenum)**.

###Shape###
A **small, J-shaped organ** in horses with a capacity of about 8–15 liters.  
It has two main regions:  
- **Non-glandular region:** for initial food storage.  
- **Glandular region:** secretes acid and enzymes for digestion.

##Function##
- Begins **digestion** of food by mixing it with stomach acid and enzymes.  
- Produces **hydrochloric acid** and **pepsin** to break down proteins.  
- Acts as a **temporary storage** before food moves to the small intestine.  
- Works continuously, as horses are natural grazers.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) — digestion of food and experiences.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Stomach Meridian.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents **how one processes and accepts nourishment and life events**.  
  - Imbalance may cause nervous tension, worry, or digestive upset.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm digestion and steady appetite.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle feeding rhythm, calm environment, and balanced meal timing.

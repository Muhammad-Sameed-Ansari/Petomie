#Kidneys#

##Location##
Located in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity on either side of the vertebral column. The right kidney lies more cranially beneath the last two ribs and is heart-shaped, while the left kidney lies slightly caudal and is bean-shaped, positioned near the spleen.

##Shape##
Paired, firm organs encased in fibrous capsules with distinct internal regions:
- **Cortex:** Outer granular zone where filtration occurs in glomeruli.
- **Medulla:** Inner striated region containing collecting ducts and loops of Henle.
- **Renal Pelvis:** Expanded funnel-like area where urine collects before entering the ureter.
- **Renal Hilus:** Indented medial border for entry of renal artery, vein, nerves, and ureter.
- **Capsule:** Thin, fibrous outer covering providing protection and structural integrity.
- **Asymmetry:** Right kidney heart-shaped; left kidney oval or bean-shaped.

##Function##
Filters blood to remove waste products and toxins
Regulates electrolyte and water balance for hydration control
Produces urine for excretion of metabolic byproducts
Secretes hormones such as erythropoietin (for red blood cell production) and renin (for blood pressure regulation)
Maintains acid-base balance and contributes to homeostasis throughout the body

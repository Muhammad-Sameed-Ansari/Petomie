#Pancreas#

##Location##
Situated deep within the abdominal cavity, lying transversely across the dorsal abdomen. In the horse, it is positioned between the stomach and the duodenum, with one lobe extending along the duodenum and another toward the spleen. The pancreatic duct opens into the duodenum near the bile duct.

##Shape##
A flattened, irregularly lobulated gland with distinct regions and ducts:
- **Right Lobe:** Extends along the descending duodenum.
- **Left Lobe:** Lies near the stomach and spleen.
- **Body:** Central portion connecting the two lobes.
- **Pancreatic Ducts:** Deliver pancreatic secretions containing digestive enzymes into the duodenum.
- **Vascular Supply:** Receives blood from branches of the celiac and cranial mesenteric arteries.

##Function##
Secretes digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, proteases) into the duodenum to aid nutrient breakdown
Produces bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid entering the small intestine
Releases insulin and glucagon from the islets of Langerhans to regulate blood sugar levels
Supports metabolism and energy balance through endocrine and exocrine activity
Coordinates with the liver and small intestine in digestion and absorption processes

#Heart#

##Location##
The heart is centrally located within the **chest cavity**, slightly left of center, between the lungs and above the diaphragm.  
It’s protected by the ribs and enclosed in the **pericardium**, a fluid-filled membrane.

###Shape###
A **muscular, cone-shaped organ** divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles.  
Blood flows through these chambers in a rhythmic cycle of contraction and relaxation.

##Function##
- Pumps **oxygen-rich blood** throughout the body.  
- Maintains **circulation and pressure balance**.

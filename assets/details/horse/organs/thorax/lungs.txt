#Lungs#

##Location##
The lungs are found inside the **thoracic cavity**, protected by the **ribcage** and lying on either side of the **heart**.  
They extend from the shoulders down to the diaphragm.

###Shape###
Soft, **spongy organs** divided into lobes:  
- Left lung: smaller, two lobes.  
- Right lung: larger, three lobes.  
Covered by a thin membrane called the **pleura**, which allows smooth movement during breathing.

##Function##
- Absorb **oxygen** and release **carbon dioxide**.  
- Maintain **acid–base balance** and temperature regulation.  
- Filter dust and microbes from inhaled air.  
- Work with the **heart and diaphragm** to sustain life energy.

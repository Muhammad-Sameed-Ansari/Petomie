#Diaphragm (Muscle)#

##Location##
The diaphragm is a **large dome-shaped muscle** located below the lungs and heart, separating the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.

###Shape###
Thin and **curved upward** when relaxed; it flattens as it contracts during inhalation.  
Central tendons attach to surrounding organs, linking breathing with body movement.

##Function##
- Main **respiratory muscle** — expands the chest cavity for inhalation.  
- Assists in **blood circulation** and **organ massage**.  
- Supports coordination between upper (thoracic) and lower (abdominal) organs.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) — personal power and will.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Liver and Spleen Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Acts as an **energetic bridge** between heart and gut emotions.  
  - Imbalance may cause tightness, shallow breathing, or anxiety.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Deep, flowing breath and calm nervous system.  
- **Energetic Support:** Belly breathing, stretching, and relaxation exercises restore diaphragmatic harmony.

#Trachea#

##Location##
The trachea, or **windpipe**, extends from the **larynx** through the **neck** into the **chest cavity**, where it divides into two bronchi leading to the lungs.  
It runs just below the esophagus and above the heart within the thoracic cavity.

###Shape###
A **flexible, tubular structure** made of C-shaped **cartilage rings** linked by connective tissue and muscle.  
The open side of each cartilage ring faces the esophagus, allowing expansion when the horse swallows.

##Function##
- Carries **air between the throat and lungs**.  
- Filters air with mucous and cilia that trap particles and push them upward.  
- **Cough reflex** clears the trachea of dust and irritants.  
- Maintains **open airflow** even as the neck bends or stretches.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) and Heart Chakra (Anahata).  
- **Meridian Connection:** Lung Meridian (vital breath and Qi).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents **the pathway of life energy and open communication**.  
  - Imbalance may manifest as coughing, breathing restriction, or emotional tension in the chest.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Smooth breath, steady rhythm, calm emotional tone.  
- **Energetic Support:** Relaxed breathing, neck release work, and grounding energy help maintain harmony in the airways.

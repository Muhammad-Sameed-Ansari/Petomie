#Esophagus#

##Location##
The esophagus is a **muscular tube** running from the **pharynx** to the **stomach**, located behind the trachea and alongside the spine.  
It passes through the chest and the **diaphragm** before joining the stomach.

###Shape###
A long, **flexible muscular tube** lined with mucosa.  
Its walls contract in rhythmic waves called **peristalsis**, pushing food and water toward the stomach.  
A **sphincter** at the stomach’s entrance prevents reflux.

##Function##
- Moves **food and water** from mouth to stomach.  
- Prevents **regurgitation** by closing the stomach entry.  
- Supports **hydration and nourishment** as part of digestion.  
- Works automatically through smooth muscle movement.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) and Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura).  
- **Meridian Connection:** Stomach Meridian (receiving) and Spleen Meridian (processing).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents **how one accepts and digests experiences** — physical and emotional.  
  - Imbalance may show as swallowing difficulty, reflux, or emotional resistance.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Ease in receiving nourishment and emotional openness.  
- **Energetic Support:** Calm feeding, slow chewing, and energy work along the neck and chest promote flow and comfort.

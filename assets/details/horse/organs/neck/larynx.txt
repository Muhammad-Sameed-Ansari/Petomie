#Larynx#

##Location##
The larynx, or **voice box**, sits in the **front of the neck**, between the **pharynx** (throat) and the **trachea** (windpipe).  
It connects the air passages and plays a role in both **breathing** and **vocalization**.  
It’s located just below the jaw and can be felt as a firm structure at the upper part of the windpipe.

###Shape###
A short, **cartilaginous tube** supported by several major cartilages — the **thyroid**, **cricoid**, and **arytenoid**.  
It contains the **vocal folds (cords)**, which open and close with each breath or sound.  
Muscles around the larynx control airflow and vibration.

##Function##
- **Regulates airflow** to and from the lungs.  
- **Produces sound** for neighing, snorting, and communication.  
- **Prevents food or water** from entering the airway during swallowing.  
- Plays a key role in **breathing rhythm** and airway protection.  

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) — communication, expression, and truth.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Triple Heater Meridian — regulates air and voice flow.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents **how one expresses themselves or holds back energy**.  
  - Imbalance may cause breathing tension, irritation, or suppressed vocal energy.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm, open expression and steady breathing rhythm.  
- **Energetic Support:** Soft voice tones, neck relaxation, and trust-based communication help harmonize throat energy.

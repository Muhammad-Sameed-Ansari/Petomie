#Pharynx#

##Location##
The pharynx lies behind the **nasal cavity and mouth**, connecting the **larynx** (for air) and **esophagus** (for food).  
It serves as a shared passageway for **breathing, swallowing, and vocalization**.

###Shape###
A **muscular tube** lined with mucous membranes.  
It contains the **soft palate** and **epiglottis**, which work together to guide food and air into their correct channels.  

##Function##
- Directs **air to the trachea** and **food to the esophagus**.  
- Coordinates **swallowing** through muscular movement.  
- Supports **sound resonance** and airflow control.  
- Helps prevent choking by sealing the airway during swallowing.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) and Heart Chakra (Anahata).  
- **Meridian Connection:** Lung Meridian (breathing flow) and Stomach Meridian (nourishment).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Symbolizes **the balance between expression and intake — breathing life and speaking truth**.  
  - Imbalance may cause swallowing difficulty or tension in the neck.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Free expression, relaxed breathing, and open emotional exchange.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle breathing exercises, soft neck massage, and calm feeding support relaxation in this region.

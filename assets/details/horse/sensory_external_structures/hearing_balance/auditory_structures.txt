#Auditory Structures#

##Location##
Located within the temporal bone of the skull, the auditory system of the horse extends from the external ear to the inner ear. It includes the outer ear (pinna and ear canal), middle ear (tympanic cavity with ossicles), and inner ear (cochlea and vestibular components).

##Shape##
Divided into three main regions:
- **External Ear:** Large, mobile pinnae funnel sound waves into the external acoustic meatus (ear canal). The pinnae are covered with fine hair and can rotate nearly 180° to localize sound.
- **Middle Ear:** Contains the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and the three auditory ossicles — **malleus, incus, and stapes** — which transmit and amplify vibrations to the inner ear.
- **Inner Ear (Cochlea):** Coiled, snail-shaped organ filled with fluid and lined with sensory hair cells that convert sound vibrations into nerve impulses transmitted via the cochlear nerve.

##Function##
Captures and directs sound waves through the external ear
Transmits and amplifies vibrations via the ossicles to the cochlea
Converts mechanical sound waves into electrical nerve signals for interpretation by the brain
Aids in spatial orientation and coordination in conjunction with vestibular structures

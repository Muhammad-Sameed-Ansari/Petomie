#Vestibular Structures#

##Location##
Situated within the inner ear, embedded in the petrous part of the temporal bone. In horses, these structures lie adjacent to the cochlea and semicircular canals, forming part of the membranous labyrinth that detects balance and spatial orientation.

##Shape##
Composed of interconnected fluid-filled chambers and canals including:
###Semicircular Canals (anterior, posterior, lateral)###
Three curved tubes arranged in different planes, each containing sensory hair cells that detect rotational movement.
###Utricle and Saccule###
Two sac-like structures within the vestibule that detect linear acceleration and head position relative to gravity.
###Vestibular Nerve###
Connects the sensory receptors of the inner ear to the brainstem, transmitting balance information.

##Function##
Detects head movement, acceleration, and changes in position
Maintains equilibrium and posture during motion and rest
Coordinates eye movements and body balance through the vestibulo-ocular reflex
Integrates sensory information with visual and proprioceptive inputs to ensure stable locomotion

#Vision Structures#

##Location##
Located within the orbits of the skull, the horse’s eyes are positioned laterally on either side of the head, providing an extensive field of vision. The eyes are supported by surrounding muscles, glands, and protective structures within the orbital cavity.

##Shape##
Composed of specialized anatomical components including:
- **Cornea:** Transparent, dome-shaped front surface that refracts and focuses incoming light.
- **Sclera:** Tough, white outer layer providing structure and protection.
- **Iris:** Colored portion regulating light entry through the pupil.
- **Pupil:** Central opening that adjusts in size to control light intensity entering the eye.
- **Lens:** Biconvex structure focusing light onto the retina.
- **Retina:** Inner light-sensitive layer containing rods and cones that convert light into nerve impulses.
- **Optic Nerve:** Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
- **Extraocular Muscles:** Control eye movement and positioning.
- **Lacrimal Apparatus:** Produces and drains tears to maintain corneal moisture and cleanliness.

##Function##
Captures and focuses light to form visual images
Converts light signals into electrical impulses for brain interpretation
Allows wide panoramic vision for detecting predators and obstacles
Enables motion detection and depth perception essential for movement and coordination
Maintains ocular health and moisture through tear production and blinking

#Accessory Structures#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the head and neck regions of the horse, surrounding and supporting the primary sensory organs such as the eyes, ears, and nose. These structures include glands, muscles, and protective tissues that assist in sensory and facial function.

##Shape##
Composed of several key anatomical components including:
- **Lacrimal Apparatus:** Located in the orbit; includes the lacrimal gland, ducts, and nasolacrimal canal that produce and drain tears to moisten and clean the eye.
- **Eyelids and Conjunctiva:** Thin protective folds and membranes that cover and lubricate the eyeball, preventing debris entry.
- **Tarsal (Meibomian) Glands:** Embedded within the eyelids, secreting oils that prevent tear evaporation.
- **Facial Muscles and Vibrissae:** Muscles and long tactile hairs around the muzzle and eyes aiding in sensation and facial expression.
- **Parotid, Mandibular, and Sublingual Glands:** Large salivary glands positioned around the jaw and throat area, responsible for saliva production.

##Function##
Protects and maintains the function of the sensory organs
Lubricates eyes and mouth for proper function and health
Assists in facial expression, communication, and tactile sensation
Supports feeding, swallowing, and environmental awareness through sensory feedback

#Proprioceptive Structures#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the musculoskeletal system, particularly in muscles, tendons, joints, and ligaments of the limbs, as well as in the skin and inner ear. Most abundant in areas of fine movement control, such as the distal limbs and cervical region.

##Shape##
Microscopic sensory receptors of varying shapes:  
- Muscle Spindles – spindle-shaped structures embedded within skeletal muscles.  
- Golgi Tendon Organs – small, fusiform receptors located at tendon–muscle junctions.  
- Joint Receptors – encapsulated endings within joint capsules and ligaments.  
- Cutaneous Receptors – specialized nerve endings in the skin.

##Function##
- Detect body position, movement, tension, and stretch.  
- Provide feedback to the central nervous system for balance and coordination.  
- Enable horses to sense limb placement during locomotion and adjust stride.  
- Protect muscles and tendons from overstretching or overload.  
- Essential for athletic performance, precise movement, and injury prevention.

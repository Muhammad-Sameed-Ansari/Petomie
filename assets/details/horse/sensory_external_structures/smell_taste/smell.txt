##Olfactory Epithelium##

#Location#
Located in the dorsocaudal part of the nasal cavity, lining the ethmoturbinates, nasal septum, and dorsal meatus.
It forms the sensory region of smell, extending over the cribriform plate where the olfactory nerves (CN I) pass to the brain.

#Shape#
A specialized mucous membrane composed of several layers:
- Olfactory receptor neurons – bipolar sensory cells detecting odor molecules.
- Supporting (sustentacular) cells – provide structural and metabolic support.
- Basal cells – stem cells regenerating new receptor neurons.
- Bowman's glands – secrete mucus that dissolves and traps odorants.

#Function#
Detects airborne odor molecules and transmits sensory signals to the olfactory bulb via Cranial Nerve I.
Enables the horse to identify scents related to food, environment, predators, and individuals.
Connects with the limbic system, influencing memory, emotion, and behavior.

##Gustatory Structure##

#Location#
Primarily located on the tongue, soft palate, and pharyngeal region.
The main sensory receptors for taste—taste buds—are concentrated on the tongue’s papillae, especially the fungiform, vallate (circumvallate), and foliate papillae.
Taste signals are carried to the brain by the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), and vagus (X) cranial nerves.

#Shape#
Composed of specialized epithelial structures called taste buds, each containing:
- Gustatory receptor cells – detect chemical taste stimuli (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami).
- Supporting cells – maintain the structure and assist receptor cells.
- Basal cells – regenerate new taste receptors every few days.
Taste buds sit within papillae, small elevations on the tongue surface:
- Fungiform papillae – rounded, scattered on the dorsal tongue tip and edges.
- Vallate papillae – large, arranged in a V-shape near the root of the tongue.
- Foliate papillae – ridged structures on the lateral tongue, prominent in some species.

#Function#
Perceives taste sensations (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami) that guide feeding behavior and food selection.
Detects chemical composition of feed to avoid toxins and encourage nutrient intake.
Stimulates salivation and digestive enzyme release in response to flavor detection.
Works closely with the olfactory system to create the full perception of flavor.
Connects to the gustatory cortex and limbic system, influencing appetite, emotion, and learning.

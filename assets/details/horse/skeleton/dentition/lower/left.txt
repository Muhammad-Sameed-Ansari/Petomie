#Lower Left Dentition#

##Location##
Located in the lower left quadrant of the horse's mouth, within the mandible (lower jaw).  
Extends from the midline (between the lower central incisors) to the last molar on the left side.

###Parts###
, Incisors (3): Broad, flat teeth at the front used for cutting grass.  
, Canine (1): Present mostly in males, used for protection or dominance.  
, Premolars (3 or 4): Strong, ridged teeth for grinding fibrous feed.  
, Molars (3): Large, flat teeth designed for crushing and mashing forage.

##Function##
, Grinds and breaks down fibrous plant material during chewing.  
, Works in coordination with the upper teeth to ensure even wear and efficient digestion.  
, Maintains jaw balance and alignment.  
, Supports natural grazing rhythm and nutrient absorption.

###Energetic Connection###
, Connected to the Stomach, Large Intestine, and Spleen meridians.  
, Reflects grounding, nourishment, and emotional assimilation.  
, Imbalances can manifest as jaw stiffness, digestive tension, or irritability.  
, Balanced energy in this region promotes calmness, strength, and healthy digestion.

##Notes##
An adult horse typically has **36 to 44 teeth total**, depending on gender and wolf teeth presence.  
Healthy lower dentition ensures even chewing motion, smooth digestion, and balanced energy flow throughout the body.

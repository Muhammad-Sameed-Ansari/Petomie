#Pelvis#

##Location##
Located at the **caudal end of the trunk**, forming the **bony girdle** that connects the vertebral column to the hind limbs.  
Articulates dorsally with the **sacrum** and ventrally at the **pelvic symphysis**, uniting the two hip bones.  
Forms the **pelvic cavity**, which houses portions of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive organs.  
Extends from the sacrum and lumbar region to the root of the tail, sloping downward and forward toward the pubic symphysis.

##Shape##
A large, basin-shaped, symmetrical structure composed of two **ossa coxarum (hip bones)**, each consisting of three fused parts:  
- **Ilium:** broad, wing-like portion forming the upper sides of the pelvis; the **tuber coxae** (“point of the hip”) and **tuber sacrale** form prominent landmarks.  
- **Ischium:** forms the caudal floor of the pelvis, ending at the **tuber ischii** (“point of the buttock”).  
- **Pubis:** the smallest and most ventral part, forming the cranial floor of the pelvic cavity and contributing to the **pelvic symphysis**.  
The **acetabulum**, formed by all three bones, is a deep, circular cavity articulating with the femoral head to form the hip joint.  
The **pelvic inlet** and **outlet** define the entrance and exit of the pelvic canal, important landmarks for foaling.

##Function##
Provides a **strong, stable attachment** between the hind limbs and the vertebral column.  
Supports and protects pelvic organs including the bladder, rectum, and reproductive structures.  
Forms the **acetabulum** for the hip joint, enabling efficient transfer of propulsive forces during movement.  
Serves as a **muscle attachment site** for powerful hindquarter, abdominal, and tail muscles.  
In females, the pelvic shape is adapted for **parturition**, allowing passage of the foal through the birth canal.  
Acts as a **shock absorber and stabilizer** during locomotion, maintaining balance and distributing weight evenly between limbs.

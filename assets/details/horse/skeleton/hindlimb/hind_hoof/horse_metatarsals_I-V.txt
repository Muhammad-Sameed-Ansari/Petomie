#Metatarsal I#

##Location##
Most medial metatarsal bone; usually absent or represented only by a minute remnant near the hock.

##Shape##
Vestigial or absent; when present, appears as a small bony nodule.

##Function##
No significant function; considered an evolutionary remnant.


#Metatarsal II#

##Location##
Medial splint bone lying alongside the cannon bone (Metatarsal III).
Extends from the distal tarsal bones to about two-thirds of the length of the cannon.

##Shape##
Slender, tapering bone attached to the cannon bone by strong interosseous ligaments.
Its distal end forms a small button palpable under the skin.

##Function##
Provides lateral stability and a surface for ligament and tendon attachment.
Contributes to shock absorption during weight-bearing.


#Metatarsal III#

##Location##
Central and largest metatarsal bone, forming the main shaft of the cannon region.
Articulates proximally with the third and fourth tarsal bones and distally with the proximal phalanges at the fetlock joint.

##Shape##
A long, strong cylindrical bone with smooth articular surfaces at both ends.
Has prominent ridges and grooves for ligament attachment.

##Function##
Serves as the main weight-bearing bone of the hind limb.
Transmits forces from the hock to the fetlock and hoof.
Provides structural support and leverage for propulsion.


#Metatarsal IV#

##Location##
Lateral splint bone running parallel to the cannon bone (Metatarsal III).
Articulates proximally with the fourth tarsal bone and fuses partway down the cannon.

##Shape##
Long, narrow bone tapering distally to form a small button at its lower end.

##Function##
Provides lateral support and stability to the metatarsal region.
Serves as attachment for ligaments stabilizing the hock and fetlock.


#Metatarsal V#

##Location##
Most lateral and caudal metatarsal; generally absent or vestigial in the horse.

##Shape##
Absent or represented by a very small bony spur near the lateral splint bone.

##Function##
No functional role; considered a vestigial structure.

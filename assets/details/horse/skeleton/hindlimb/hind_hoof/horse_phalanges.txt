#Phalanges#

##Location##
Located in the distal portion of the hind limb, forming the digit within the hoof.
The horse has only one functional digit (digit III), which consists of three phalanges: proximal, middle, and distal.

##Shape##
- **Proximal Phalanx (P1 / Long Pastern Bone):** Long, cylindrical bone connecting the fetlock to the pastern.
- **Middle Phalanx (P2 / Short Pastern Bone):** Shorter and flattened bone articulating between the long pastern and coffin bone.
- **Distal Phalanx (P3 / Coffin Bone):** Triangular, wedge-shaped bone enclosed within the hoof capsule; provides the structure for the hoof.

##Function##
Form the bony framework of the hoof and pastern.
Transmit forces from the limb through the fetlock to the ground.
Provide leverage, stability, and flexibility during locomotion.
Support the hoof capsule and distribute weight during stance and motion.

#Sesamoids#

##Location##
Located in association with the joints of the distal limb.
Two proximal sesamoids are found at the back of the fetlock joint, and one distal sesamoid (navicular bone) lies behind the coffin joint.

##Shape##
- **Proximal Sesamoids:** Two small, triangular bones embedded within the suspensory ligament behind the fetlock.
- **Distal Sesamoid (Navicular Bone):** Boat-shaped bone located between the distal end of the short pastern (P2) and the coffin bone (P3).

##Function##
Act as pulleys for flexor tendons to improve mechanical efficiency.
Reduce friction and protect tendons from stress during flexion and extension.
Provide leverage and smooth gliding surfaces for tendons crossing the joints.
Play a vital role in shock absorption and energy transfer in the distal limb.

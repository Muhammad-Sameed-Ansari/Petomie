#Tibia#

##Location##
Located in the hindlimb between the stifle and the hock, forming the main bone of the leg (crus).
It articulates proximally with the femur at the stifle joint and distally with the talus and fibula at the hock joint.

##Shape##
A long, strong bone with a broad proximal end featuring the tibial plateau and intercondylar eminence.
The shaft tapers distally and ends with a prominent medial malleolus.
The tibial crest runs along the cranial surface, serving as a major site for muscle attachment.

##Function##
Bears most of the weight of the hindlimb and transfers forces from the femur to the hock.
Provides attachment for key muscles such as the gastrocnemius and digital flexors.
Forms the primary structure of the crus and contributes to stability and propulsion during movement.

#Tibia#

##Location##
Located in the lower hindlimb, between the stifle and hock joints.  
The tibia is the main weight-bearing bone of the leg and one of the strongest bones in the horse’s skeleton.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal End** – Broad upper region articulating with the femur at the stifle joint.  
   Features:  
   - **Medial and Lateral Condyles**: Form the articular surfaces with the femur.  
   - **Intercondylar Eminence**: Ridge between condyles for ligament attachment.  
   - **Tibial Tuberosity**: Large anterior projection for attachment of the patellar ligament.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, slightly curved portion extending down the limb.  
   Provides attachment for muscles of the lower hindlimb.  
   Includes the **tibial crest**, a strong ridge along the front surface.

3. **Distal End** – Narrow section forming the upper part of the hock joint.  
   Articulates with the talus via the cochlea of the tibia, creating the main hinge motion.  
   Includes the **medial malleolus**, which stabilizes the hock joint.

##Function##
 Bears the horse’s weight and transmits it from the femur to the hock.  
 Provides attachment for major flexor and extensor muscles.  
 Facilitates movement of the hock and stifle joints.  
 Contributes to propulsion, support, and shock absorption during locomotion.

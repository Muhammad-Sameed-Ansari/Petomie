#Fibula#

##Location##
Located along the lateral side of the tibia in the lower hindlimb.  
The fibula is a slender, partially fused bone extending from the stifle to the hock region.  
In horses, the fibula is reduced in size compared to other species, serving primarily as a stabilizing structure.

###Parts###
1. **Head of Fibula** – Proximal end articulating with the lateral condyle of the tibia.  
   Provides attachment for ligaments of the stifle joint.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – The midsection of the fibula is thin and incomplete in horses.  
   Fused with the tibia for most of its length, contributing to limb stability.

3. **Distal End (Lateral Malleolus)** – Small, separate piece near the hock joint.  
   Articulates with the calcaneus and lateral tarsal bones, adding lateral reinforcement.

##Function##
 Provides minor structural support to the tibia.  
 Contributes to stability of the stifle and hock joints.  
 Serves as an attachment site for lateral muscles and ligaments.  
 Assists in maintaining balance and alignment of the lower hindlimb.

#Fibula#

##Location##
Situated lateral to the tibia in the horse’s hindlimb.
It articulates proximally with the lateral condyle of the tibia and is reduced in length, ending about midway down the tibia.

##Shape##
A slender, reduced bone consisting of a small proximal head and a narrow shaft that becomes vestigial distally.
In most horses, the distal portion is fused to the tibia or represented by a small remnant.

##Function##
Provides limited structural support but serves as an attachment site for lateral muscles of the leg.
Contributes to the stability of the proximal hock region.
Although largely vestigial, it plays a minor role in guiding muscular and ligamentous structures along the crus.

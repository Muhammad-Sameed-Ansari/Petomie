#Patella#

##Location##
Located at the front of the stifle joint in the hindlimb.  
The patella is a large, triangular sesamoid bone embedded in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle.  
It lies between the femur and tibia, forming part of the stifle joint and acting as a protective and mechanical structure.

###Parts###
1. **Base** – The broad, proximal part of the bone.  
   Provides attachment for the quadriceps tendon.  
   Transmits muscle force from the thigh to the lower leg during limb extension.

2. **Apex** – The pointed distal tip of the patella.  
   Attaches to the middle patellar ligament, which connects to the tibial tuberosity.  
   Plays a key role in the locking mechanism of the stifle.

3. **Articular Surface** – Smooth posterior surface that articulates with the femoral trochlea.  
   Covered by thick cartilage to reduce friction during movement.  
   Guides the patella along the femur during flexion and extension.

4. **Medial and Lateral Ridges** – Raised borders that help secure the patella within the trochlear groove.  
   The medial ridge is involved in the passive locking mechanism of the stifle, unique to horses.

##Function##
 Protects the stifle joint and enhances limb movement efficiency.  
 Acts as a fulcrum to increase the leverage of the quadriceps muscle.  
 Facilitates extension of the hindlimb and enables the stay apparatus for standing at rest.  
 Provides stability and reduces friction during locomotion.  
 Plays an essential role in the horse’s ability to lock the hindlimb when standing.

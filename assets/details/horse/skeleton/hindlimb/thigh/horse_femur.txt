#Femur#

##Location##
Extends from the hip joint to the stifle joint, forming the thigh region of the hindlimb.
It articulates proximally with the acetabulum of the pelvis and distally with the tibia and patella.

##Shape##
A large, strong, and slightly curved long bone with a spherical head at the proximal end, which fits into the acetabulum.
The shaft is robust with prominent ridges for muscle attachment, and the distal end has medial and lateral condyles separated by the trochlear groove.

##Function##
Supports weight transfer from the pelvis to the lower limb.
Forms the upper portion of the stifle joint and contributes to locomotion through powerful muscular attachments.
Provides attachment points for major muscles such as the gluteals, quadriceps, and hamstrings.
Plays a critical role in propulsion, shock absorption, and stability during movement.

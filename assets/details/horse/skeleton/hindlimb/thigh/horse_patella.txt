#Patella#

##Location##
Located at the front of the stifle joint, embedded within the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle.
It articulates with the trochlear ridges of the distal femur and glides within the trochlear groove during limb movement.

##Shape##
Large, roughly triangular sesamoid bone with a smooth articular surface posteriorly.
The medial ridge of the femur is prominent, allowing the patella to lock over it as part of the stay apparatus.

##Function##
Acts as a fulcrum to enhance the leverage of the quadriceps muscle during extension of the stifle.
Plays a key role in the stay apparatus by allowing the horse to lock its stifle joint and rest while standing.
Protects the stifle joint and facilitates smooth gliding of the quadriceps tendon over the femur.

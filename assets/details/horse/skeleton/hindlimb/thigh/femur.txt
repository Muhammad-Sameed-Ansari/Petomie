#Femur#

##Location##
Located in the upper hindlimb, between the pelvis and the tibia.  
The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the horse’s body, forming the thigh and connecting the hip and stifle joints.  
It supports powerful muscles responsible for propulsion, balance, and stability.

###Parts###
1. **Head** – Rounded upper end of the bone.  
   Articulates with the acetabulum of the pelvis, forming the hip joint.  
   Allows multidirectional motion and transmits weight from the body to the hindlimb.

2. **Neck** – Narrow region connecting the head to the shaft.  
   Provides flexibility and acts as a transitional area for muscle and ligament attachment.

3. **Greater Trochanter** – Large projection on the lateral side of the proximal femur.  
   Serves as a major attachment site for gluteal muscles involved in limb extension and abduction.

4. **Lesser Trochanter** – Small projection on the medial side below the neck.  
   Provides attachment for the iliopsoas muscle, aiding in hip flexion.

5. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, cylindrical portion of the femur.  
   Supports the thigh muscles and transmits forces during locomotion.  
   Provides attachment for powerful extensor and flexor muscles.

6. **Third Trochanter** – Prominent lateral projection midway along the shaft.  
   Serves as an attachment site for the superficial gluteal muscle.  
   Unique to horses and key in hindlimb propulsion.

7. **Medial and Lateral Condyles** – Rounded distal ends of the bone.  
   Articulate with the tibia and patella to form the stifle joint.  
   Enable smooth flexion and extension of the hindlimb.

8. **Trochlea of Femur** – Smooth groove between the condyles on the cranial surface.  
   Guides the patella during movement and contributes to the locking mechanism of the stifle.

##Function##
 Supports the weight of the body and transmits it to the lower limb.  
 Provides attachment for major muscles of locomotion.  
 Enables flexion, extension, and rotation of the hindlimb.  
 Contributes to propulsion and balance during movement.  
 Acts as a lever for efficient transfer of muscular force in galloping, jumping, and standing.

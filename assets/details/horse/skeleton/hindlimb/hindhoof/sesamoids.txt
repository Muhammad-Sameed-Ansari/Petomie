#Sesamoid Bones#

##Location##
Located at key joint areas of the limbs, embedded within tendons to reduce friction and increase leverage.  
In the horse’s hindlimb, sesamoid bones are found at the fetlock joint (proximal sesamoids) and within the hoof (distal sesamoid or navicular bone).

###Parts###
1. **Proximal Sesamoid Bones (2 per limb)** – Located at the back of the fetlock joint, behind the metatarsophalangeal articulation.  
   Embedded within the suspensory ligament.  
   Function as pulleys for tendons, distributing stress and aiding flexion.

2. **Distal Sesamoid Bone (Navicular Bone)** – Small, boat-shaped bone behind the coffin joint.  
   Lies between the distal phalanx (coffin bone) and the middle phalanx (short pastern).  
   Provides smooth surface for the deep digital flexor tendon, reducing friction during limb movement.

##Function##
 Act as levers to enhance tendon efficiency.  
 Reduce wear on tendons and distribute mechanical stress during motion.  
 Support joint flexibility and prevent hyperextension of the fetlock and coffin joints.  
 Contribute to shock absorption and limb durability during locomotion.

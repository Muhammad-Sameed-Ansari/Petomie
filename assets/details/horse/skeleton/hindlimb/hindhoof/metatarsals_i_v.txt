#Metatarsals#

##Location##
Located between the hock and the fetlock joint.  
Form the cannon region of the hindlimb and consist of one large weight-bearing bone and two smaller splint bones.

###Parts###
1. **Third Metatarsal (Cannon Bone)** – The central and largest metatarsal bone.  
   Extends from the hock to the fetlock.  
   Bears most of the weight and serves as the main shaft of the lower limb.  
   Articulates proximally with the tarsal bones and distally with the proximal phalanx and sesamoids.

2. **Second and Fourth Metatarsals (Splint Bones)** – Narrow, slender bones attached to the sides of the cannon bone.  
   Provide lateral support and stability.  
   Fuse partially with the cannon bone in mature horses.  
   Aid in shock absorption and balance during motion.

##Function##
 Transmit weight and force between the hock and fetlock.  
 Provide stability and alignment for the limb.  
 Support the fetlock joint during impact.  
 Serve as attachment sites for suspensory and interosseous ligaments.  
 Contribute to propulsion and balance in movement.

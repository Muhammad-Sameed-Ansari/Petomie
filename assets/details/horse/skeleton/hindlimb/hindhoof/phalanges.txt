#Phalanges#

##Location##
Form the distal part of the hindlimb, extending from the fetlock joint to the hoof.  
Each digit (only one functional in horses) contains three phalanges arranged in sequence.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal Phalanx (Long Pastern Bone)** – The first bone below the fetlock.  
   Articulates proximally with the third metatarsal bone and distally with the middle phalanx.  
   Provides leverage for flexion and extension of the pastern joint.  
   Features rough surfaces for ligament and tendon attachments.

2. **Middle Phalanx (Short Pastern Bone)** – Intermediate segment between the long pastern and coffin bones.  
   Forms the pastern joint with the proximal phalanx and the coffin joint with the distal phalanx.  
   Short and strong, designed to absorb impact.

3. **Distal Phalanx (Coffin Bone)** – Enclosed within the hoof capsule.  
   Shaped like a crescent and serves as the foundation of the hoof.  
   Provides attachment for the deep digital flexor tendon and laminae of the hoof wall.

##Function##
 Provide structural support for the lower limb and hoof.  
 Enable flexion and extension of the fetlock, pastern, and coffin joints.  
 Bear and distribute weight during locomotion.  
 Serve as anchoring structures for tendons and ligaments involved in shock absorption.

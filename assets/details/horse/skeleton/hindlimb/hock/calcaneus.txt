#Calcaneus#

##Location##
Located at the back of the hock joint, forming the heel and point of the hock.  
It is the longest tarsal bone and serves as a major lever arm for the muscles of propulsion.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – Central elongated portion forming the heel.  
   Provides attachment for the gastrocnemius (Achilles) tendon.  
   Articulates proximally with the fibula and distally with the fourth tarsal bone.

2. **Calcaneal Tuberosity** – Prominent projection forming the point of the hock.  
   Acts as a lever for powerful extension of the hindlimb.

3. **Articular Facets** – Smooth surfaces for articulation with the talus and fibula.  
   Allow coordinated motion between upper and lower hock segments.

4. **Sustentaculum Tali** – Medial projection supporting the talus.  
   Guides the deep digital flexor tendon along the hock’s plantar surface.

##Function##
 Serves as the main lever for propulsion during movement.  
 Provides attachment for flexor and extensor tendons.  
 Aids in extension of the hock and thrust during locomotion.  
 Acts as a shock absorber during landing and galloping.

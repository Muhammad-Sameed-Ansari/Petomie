#Central Tarsal Bone#

##Location##
Located in the midsection of the hock between the talus above and the first, second, and third tarsal bones below.  
Acts as a pivotal bone in the middle row of the tarsus.

###Parts###
1. **Dorsal Surface** – Articulates with the talus, forming part of the proximal intertarsal joint.  
   Supports rotation and limited flexion during limb motion.

2. **Plantar Surface** – Articulates with the second and third tarsal bones.  
   Distributes weight between the upper and lower rows of the tarsus.

3. **Medial and Lateral Facets** – Provide articulation with adjacent tarsal bones, ensuring stability and even weight transfer.

##Function##
 Acts as a bridge between upper and lower tarsal rows.  
 Distributes load and maintains hock stability.  
 Assists in smooth energy transmission during flexion and extension.  
 Allows limited rotation, enhancing joint shock absorption.

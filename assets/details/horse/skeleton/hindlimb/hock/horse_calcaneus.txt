#Calcaneus#

##Location##
Located in the proximal row of the tarsus, lateral to the talus.
Projects caudally and proximally to form the point of the hock (tuber calcanei).

##Shape##
Elongated bone with a prominent calcaneal tuber at its proximal end.
The distal portion articulates with the fourth tarsal bone, while the proximal portion serves as a lever for muscle attachment.

##Function##
Acts as a lever arm for the gastrocnemius and superficial digital flexor muscles.
Forms the attachment site for the Achilles tendon.
Provides mechanical advantage for hock extension and supports weight transfer.

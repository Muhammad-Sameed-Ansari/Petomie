#Tarsals#

##Location##
Located in the hock region of the hindlimb, between the tibia and fibula above and the metatarsal bones below.  
The horse’s tarsals form the hock joint, a complex, multi-boned structure that allows powerful flexion and extension of the hindlimb.

###Parts###
1. **Talus (Tibial Tarsal Bone)** – The uppermost tarsal bone that articulates with the tibia.  
   Forms the main hinge joint of the hock, allowing flexion and extension.  
   Transmits body weight from the leg to the lower limb.

2. **Calcaneus (Fibular Tarsal Bone)** – Forms the heel and point of the hock.  
   Provides leverage for the powerful flexor muscles.  
   Serves as an attachment point for the Achilles tendon and acts as a major lever for propulsion.

3. **Central Tarsal Bone** – Located below the talus, connecting the upper and lower rows of the tarsus.  
   Provides stability and transfers weight evenly through the hock.  
   Articulates with the second and third tarsal bones.

4. **First and Second Tarsal Bones (Often Fused)** – Found in the distal row of the tarsus.  
   Articulate with the central and third tarsal bones above and the second metatarsal bone below.  
   Provide flexibility and strength in the lower hock.

5. **Third Tarsal Bone** – Lies between the central and the third metatarsal (cannon) bone.  
   Bears much of the load transferred through the hock during motion.  
   Key component of the tarsometatarsal joint.

6. **Fourth Tarsal Bone** – The largest of the distal row, spanning both upper and lower tarsal rows.  
   Articulates with the calcaneus above and the fourth metatarsal bone below.  
   Adds lateral support and contributes to shock absorption.

##Function##
 Forms the skeletal base of the hock joint.  
 Provides stability and strength while allowing controlled flexion and extension.  
 Transmits weight from the tibia to the metatarsals during locomotion.  
 Acts as a lever system for propulsion and shock absorption.  
 Supports the horse’s balance and powerful movement during galloping and jumping.

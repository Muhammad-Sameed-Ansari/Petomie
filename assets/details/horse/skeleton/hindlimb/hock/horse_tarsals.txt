#Tarsal I#

##Location##
Located on the medial side of the distal tarsal row.
Articulates proximally with the central tarsal bone and distally with the first metatarsal bone (if present).

##Shape##
Small, irregular bone—often partially fused or rudimentary in horses.

##Function##
Minor role in support and articulation of the medial side of the tarsus.
Contributes to balance and alignment of the distal tarsal region.


#Tarsal II#

##Location##
Situated between the first and third tarsal bones in the distal row.
Articulates proximally with the central tarsal bone and distally with the second metatarsal bone.

##Shape##
Small, wedge-shaped bone with smooth articular surfaces.

##Function##
Supports the second metatarsal bone.
Assists in distributing weight and maintaining flexibility of the tarsus.


#Tarsal III#

##Location##
Occupies the middle of the distal tarsal row.
Articulates proximally with the central tarsal bone and distally with the third metatarsal bone.

##Shape##
Larger than the second tarsal bone, with flat and broad articular surfaces.

##Function##
Acts as the primary connection between the talus and the third metatarsal (cannon) bone.
Bears a significant portion of weight transferred through the tarsus.


#Tarsal IV#

##Location##
Located on the lateral side of the distal tarsal row.
Articulates proximally with the calcaneus and distally with the fourth and lateral part of the third metatarsal bones.

##Shape##
Largest of the distal tarsal bones.
Extends between the proximal and distal rows of the tarsus with multiple articulations.

##Function##
Supports the lateral aspect of the hock and distributes load to the metatarsus.
Provides strength and stability during movement.

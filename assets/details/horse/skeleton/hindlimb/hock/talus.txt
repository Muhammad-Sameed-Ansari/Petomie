#Talus#

##Location##
Located at the top of the hock joint, between the tibia and the central tarsal bone.  
The talus, also known as the tibial tarsal bone, is the main bone responsible for forming the hinge joint of the hock.  
It lies medial to the calcaneus and supports most of the downward force transmitted from the leg.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – The central mass of the bone.  
   Articulates proximally with the tibia and distally with the central tarsal bone.  
   Transmits weight and stabilizes the hock during standing and motion.

2. **Trochlea of Talus** – A prominent double pulley-like ridge on the dorsal surface.  
   Fits into the tibial cochlea to form the main hinge joint.  
   Guides flexion and extension while preventing lateral movement.

3. **Head** – The rounded anterior end of the bone.  
   Articulates with the central tarsal bone, forming part of the proximal intertarsal joint.  
   Aids in smooth movement between upper and middle rows of tarsals.

4. **Neck** – The narrow region connecting the head and body.  
   Provides slight flexibility and acts as a transition between the articular surfaces.  
   Serves as a site for ligament attachment.

5. **Articular Facets** – Smooth surfaces on the sides and underside of the bone.  
   Articulate with the calcaneus and adjacent tarsal bones.  
   Ensure even pressure distribution across the hock joint.

##Function##
 Forms the main pivot of the hock joint.  
 Allows controlled flexion and extension of the hindlimb.  
 Transmits weight from the tibia to the lower tarsal bones.  
 Provides stability and coordination between upper and lower segments of the limb.  
 Acts as a hinge and stabilizer during running, jumping, and landing.

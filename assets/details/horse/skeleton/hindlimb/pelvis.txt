#Pelvis#

##Location##
Located at the base of the vertebral column, connecting the hindlimbs to the spine.  
The pelvis is a large, sturdy structure formed by the fusion of three bones on each side: the ilium, ischium, and pubis.  
Both halves unite at the pelvic symphysis and articulate with the sacrum at the sacroiliac joints.

###Parts###
1. **Ilium** – The largest and most cranial part of the pelvis.  
   - **Wing (Ala of Ilium)**: Broad, flat surface forming the side of the pelvis.  
   - **Tuber Coxae (Point of Hip)**: Lateral projection palpable on both sides of the horse.  
   - **Tuber Sacrale**: Medial projection articulating with the sacrum.  
   Provides attachment for gluteal and back muscles and supports weight transfer from spine to limb.

2. **Ischium** – Forms the caudal portion of the pelvis.  
   - **Ischial Tuberosity (Point of Buttock)**: Strong prominence for attachment of hamstring muscles.  
   - **Ischial Arch**: Concave border forming the caudal limit of the pelvic outlet.  
   Provides leverage for propulsion during movement.

3. **Pubis** – The smallest and most ventral part of the pelvis.  
   - **Pubic Symphysis**: Midline joint uniting both halves of the pelvis.  
   - **Pecten of Pubis**: Ridge that supports abdominal and pelvic muscles.  
   Supports reproductive and urinary organs and completes the pelvic floor.

4. **Acetabulum** – Deep, cup-shaped socket formed by the junction of the ilium, ischium, and pubis.  
   - Articulates with the head of the femur to form the hip joint.  
   - Provides stability and weight distribution during locomotion.

5. **Pelvic Cavity** – Space enclosed by the pelvis.  
   Houses parts of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive organs.  
   Shaped to allow passage during foaling in mares.

##Function##
 Supports and connects the hindlimbs to the spine.  
 Transmits body weight from the trunk to the hindlimbs.  
 Provides attachment for powerful locomotor muscles.  
 Protects pelvic organs and contributes to balance during motion.  
 Forms part of the birth canal in mares.

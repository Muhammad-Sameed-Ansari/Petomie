#Scapula#

##Location##
The scapula, or shoulder blade, is a large flat bone located on each side of the upper thorax.  
It lies between the neck and the upper limb, connecting the forelimb to the body via muscles instead of joints.  
It is positioned at an angle against the ribs, forming the foundation of the shoulder region.

##Shape##
A broad, triangular bone with a prominent ridge (the spine of the scapula) that divides its surface into two areas — the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae.  
At its lower end is the glenoid cavity, which forms the socket for the shoulder joint with the humerus.  
The upper edge, called the cartilage of the scapula, extends the bone’s surface for muscle attachment.  
The scapula is slightly curved to match the contour of the ribcage.

##Function##
- Provides attachment for major shoulder and forelimb muscles, including the trapezius, deltoid, and serratus ventralis.  
- Forms the socket for the shoulder joint, allowing limb movement and flexibility.  
- Supports weight transfer from the body to the forelimb through muscular connection.  
- Protects underlying structures such as the thoracic wall.  
- Contributes to stride length and forward motion during locomotion.

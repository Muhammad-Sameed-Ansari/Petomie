#Cervical Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located in the neck region, between the skull and the thoracic vertebrae.  
In horses, there are typically **7 cervical vertebrae (C1–C7)**, forming a long, flexible neck that allows a wide range of movement for grazing, communication, and balance.

###Parts###
1. **C1 (Atlas)** – The first cervical vertebra connecting directly to the skull at the occipital bone.  
   Allows the head to nod up and down (“yes” motion).  
   Has a large ring-like shape with no true body and wide transverse processes for ligament attachment.

2. **C2 (Axis)** – The second cervical vertebra, characterized by a bony projection called the dens.  
   Allows the head to rotate side-to-side (“no” motion).  
   Strong and compact to support head movement and stability.

3. **C3 (Third Cervical Vertebra)** – Acts as a transitional vertebra supporting mid-neck flexibility.  
   Provides attachment for neck muscles responsible for head elevation and lateral motion.

4. **C4 (Fourth Cervical Vertebra)** – Located centrally in the neck.  
   Provides leverage and support for muscles that control fine neck and head adjustments.  
   Contributes to balance and posture during grazing and movement.

5. **C5 (Fifth Cervical Vertebra)** – Features large transverse processes for strong muscle attachment.  
   Assists in maintaining neck curvature and flexibility.  
   Supports both lifting and lowering movements of the head.

6. **C6 (Sixth Cervical Vertebra)** – Has uniquely shaped ventral laminae that serve as muscle anchors.  
   A key structure for cervical stability and movement coordination.  
   Supports the deep muscles that stabilize the shoulder and neck.

7. **C7 (Seventh Cervical Vertebra)** – The final cervical vertebra connecting to the first thoracic vertebra (T1).  
   Less mobile than the others and provides structural transition to the thoracic region.  
   Serves as a strong anchor for ligaments linking the neck and back.

##Function##
 Supports the head and enables flexible neck movement.  
 Protects the spinal cord and major blood vessels passing to the brain.  
 Provides attachment for muscles controlling the head, neck, and shoulders.  
 Allows grazing, reaching, and expressive communication.  
 Plays a key role in balance and coordination during locomotion.

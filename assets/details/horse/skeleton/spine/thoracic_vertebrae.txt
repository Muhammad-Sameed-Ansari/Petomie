#Thoracic Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located between the cervical (neck) and lumbar (lower back) vertebrae, forming the midsection of the spine.  
In horses, there are typically **18 thoracic vertebrae (T1–T18)**, each attached to a pair of ribs, creating the ribcage that protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs.

###Parts###
1. **T1 (First Thoracic Vertebra)** – Articulates with the last cervical vertebra (C7).  
   Marks the beginning of the thoracic spine.  
   Has large transverse processes and a high dorsal spine to support the shoulder and neck muscles.

2. **T2–T5 (Cranial Thoracic Vertebrae)** – Have tall spinous processes forming the withers.  
   Provide attachment for strong neck and shoulder muscles.  
   Help anchor the ligaments that stabilize the back during movement.

3. **T6–T10 (Middle Thoracic Vertebrae)** – Form the highest part of the withers, especially around T6–T8.  
   Act as attachment points for the nuchal ligament and back muscles.  
   Provide flexibility and support for forelimb motion and saddle placement.

4. **T11–T14 (Middle-Posterior Thoracic Vertebrae)** – Spinous processes begin to shorten and tilt backward.  
   Allow increased flexibility in the mid-back.  
   Support ribs that protect major organs and assist in breathing dynamics.

5. **T15–T18 (Caudal Thoracic Vertebrae)** – Spinous processes are shorter and angled caudally.  
   T18 articulates with the first lumbar vertebra (L1).  
   Provide attachment for muscles involved in propulsion and back extension.

##Function##
 Supports the ribcage and protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs.  
 Provides attachment points for ribs, muscles, and ligaments.  
 Assists in breathing by maintaining the structure of the thoracic cavity.  
 Contributes to weight distribution between forelimbs and hindquarters.  
 Helps maintain posture and flexibility during locomotion.

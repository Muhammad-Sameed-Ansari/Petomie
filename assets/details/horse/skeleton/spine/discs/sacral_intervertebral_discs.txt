#Sacral Intervertebral Discs#

##Location##
Present only in early development between the sacral vertebrae before natural fusion occurs. In the mature adult, the sacrum forms a single fused structure with no functional intervertebral discs.

###Shape###
In young horses, the discs are small fibrocartilage pads. As the sacrum fuses, these discs diminish and become part of the fused sacral plate.

###Parts###

##Annulus Fibrosus##
Originally present as a thin fibrocartilage ring providing early-life stability.
Energetically represents the development of structure, grounding, and foundational strength.

##Nucleus Pulposus##
Small, soft cartilage core that offers temporary cushioning before fusion.
Energetically reflects adaptability and the early shaping of emotional and physical balance.

##Individual Sacral Disc Regions##

###S1–S2 Region###
Once separated by a disc during youth, later fuses to form the top of the sacral arch.
Energetically supports early grounding and stability.

###S2–S3 Region###
Contributes to the mid-sacral fusion plate.
Energetically connected to balance between motion and stability.

###S3–S4 Region###
Fuses as part of pelvic support development.
Energetically relates to forming inner alignment and emotional steadiness.

###S4–S5 Region###
Final section of sacral fusion, supporting pelvic load and hind-end power.
Energetically reflects completing foundational growth and grounding.

###Function###
Provides cushioning and spacing during early skeletal development.  
In adulthood, the fused sacrum provides powerful pelvic stability, load distribution, and hind-end engagement.

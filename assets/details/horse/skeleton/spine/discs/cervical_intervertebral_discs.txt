#Cervical Intervertebral Discs#

##Location##
Between each cervical vertebra from C2–C7, supporting neck motion and absorbing shock.

###Shape###
Fibrocartilage pads shaped to match the curved cervical vertebrae, allowing a wide range of motion.

###Parts###

##Annulus Fibrosus##

Energetically, represents structure, containment, and boundary strength.

##Nucleus Pulposus##
Soft inner core providing cushioning and shock absorption.
Energetically, reflects fluidity, adaptability, and emotional flexibility.

##Individual Cervical Discs##

###C5–C6 Disc###
Controls the alignment of lower cervical motion, especially during collection.
Energetically helps releasing pressure and overthinking.

###C6–C7 Disc###
Transitions neck movement toward the thoracic sling.
Energetically supports grounding and stable movement.

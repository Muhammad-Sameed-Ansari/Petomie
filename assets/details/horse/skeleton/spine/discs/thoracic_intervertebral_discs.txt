#Thoracic Intervertebral Discs#

##Location##
Between each thoracic vertebra from T1–T18, stabilizing the back and supporting rib articulation.

###Shape###
Thicker dorsally, designed to stabilize the ribcage and minimize excessive flexion while maintaining strength.

###Parts###

##Annulus Fibrosus##
Tough outer fibrocartilage ring that provides structural containment and joint stability.
Energetically represents boundaries, grounding, and support under pressure.

##Nucleus Pulposus##
Soft inner core that absorbs shock and disperses force during movement.
Energetically reflects fluidity, adaptability, and emotional resilience.

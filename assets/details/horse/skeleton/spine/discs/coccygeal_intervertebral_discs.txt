#Coccygeal Intervertebral Discs#

##Location##
Between each coccygeal (tail) vertebra, allowing mobility, communication, and fine articulation through the tail.

###Shape###
Small, simple fibrocartilage pads designed more for flexibility than load-bearing, gradually decreasing in size toward the tip of the tail.

###Parts###

##Annulus Fibrosus##
Thin fibrocartilage ring offering stability while allowing expressive movement.
Energetically represents boundaries, emotional containment, and gentle support.

##Nucleus Pulposus##
Soft central core providing mild cushioning and smooth articulation.
Energetically reflects adaptability, emotional flow, and expressive release.

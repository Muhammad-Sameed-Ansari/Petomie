#Caudal Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located in the tail region, extending from the sacrum to the tip of the tail.  
The caudal vertebrae form the bony structure of the tail and vary in number, typically between **15 and 21** in horses.  
They gradually decrease in size and complexity from the base to the tip of the tail.

###Parts###
1. **Cd1 (First Caudal Vertebra)** – Articulates with the fifth sacral vertebra (S5).  
   Forms the base of the tail and contributes to the attachment of strong ligaments and muscles controlling tail movement.

2. **Cd2 (Second Caudal Vertebra)** – Connects closely to Cd1, maintaining structural strength at the tail base.  
   Assists in movement control and provides protection for the caudal spinal nerves.

3. **Cd3 (Third Caudal Vertebra)** – Acts as a transitional vertebra, balancing flexibility and strength.  
   Supports muscle attachments for lifting and swishing the tail.

4. **Cd4–Cd10 (Middle Caudal Vertebrae)** – Intermediate vertebrae that allow flexible tail movement.  
   Provide anchoring points for muscles and tendons that control lateral and vertical tail motion.  
   Protect blood vessels and nerves running along the tail.

5. **Cd11–Cd15 (Distal Caudal Vertebrae)** – Smaller, cylindrical bones with reduced processes.  
   Offer flexibility at the tail’s midsection and support expressive tail actions for communication and balance.

6. **Cd16–Cd21 (Terminal Caudal Vertebrae)** – The smallest and simplest vertebrae, often ending in cartilage.  
   Form the tail tip and provide minimal movement while maintaining shape and stability.

##Function##
 Provides structural support and flexibility to the tail.  
 Enables communication through expressive movements.  
 Assists in balance and coordination during locomotion.  
 Protects blood vessels and nerves extending into the tail.  
 Aids in fly control and social signaling among horses.

#Lumbar Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located between the thoracic and sacral vertebrae, forming the lower back region of the spine.  
In horses, there are typically **6 lumbar vertebrae (L1–L6)**, though some individuals may have 5 or 7.  
These vertebrae are large and strong to support the weight of the abdomen and rider.

###Parts###
1. **L1 (First Lumbar Vertebra)** – Articulates with the last thoracic vertebra (T18).  
   Acts as a transition point between the ribcage and the lower back.  
   Provides attachment for muscles that stabilize the spine and assist with back flexion.

2. **L2 (Second Lumbar Vertebra)** – Features broad transverse processes for powerful muscle attachment.  
   Supports bending and rotation of the back and assists in weight transfer during movement.

3. **L3 (Third Lumbar Vertebra)** – Central lumbar vertebra that helps maintain spinal stability.  
   Serves as a key support structure during galloping and collection in ridden horses.

4. **L4 (Fourth Lumbar Vertebra)** – Provides leverage for the long back muscles (longissimus dorsi).  
   Plays a role in transmitting propulsive force from the hindquarters to the front end.  
   Supports balance during flexion and extension.

5. **L5 (Fifth Lumbar Vertebra)** – Connects closely with the pelvis through the sacroiliac ligaments.  
   Aids in back flexibility and stability during jumping or rearing.  
   Supports strong muscular attachments for hindquarter propulsion.

6. **L6 (Sixth Lumbar Vertebra)** – Articulates with the sacrum (S1).  
   Acts as the bridge between the lumbar spine and pelvis.  
   Provides attachment for psoas and longissimus muscles, essential for collection and impulsion.

##Function##
 Supports the weight of the trunk and rider.  
 Provides flexibility and shock absorption during movement.  
 Transmits force from hindquarters to forehand.  
 Protects the spinal cord and major nerves.  
 Serves as a major anchor point for powerful back and abdominal muscles.

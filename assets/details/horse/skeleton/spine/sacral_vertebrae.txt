#Sacral Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located between the lumbar and caudal (tail) vertebrae, forming the posterior part of the spine.  
The sacral vertebrae are fused into a single solid bone called the **sacrum**, which connects the spine to the pelvis.  
In horses, there are typically **5 sacral vertebrae**, fused together to provide strength and stability.

###Parts###
1. **S1 (First Sacral Vertebra)** – Articulates with the last lumbar vertebra (L6).  
   Forms the front part of the sacrum and the base of the pelvic attachment.  
   Transmits body weight from the spine to the hind limbs through the pelvis.

2. **S2 (Second Sacral Vertebra)** – Supports the central portion of the sacrum.  
   Provides attachment for strong ligaments and muscles associated with the hindquarters.  
   Contributes to pelvic stability and hind leg propulsion.

3. **S3 (Third Sacral Vertebra)** – Forms part of the sacral crest and central ridge.  
   Serves as an anchoring point for tendons that stabilize the pelvis during locomotion.  
   Plays a role in distributing weight evenly during movement and standing.

4. **S4 (Fourth Sacral Vertebra)** – Lies toward the posterior section of the sacrum.  
   Supports the caudal vertebrae and transitions toward the tail base.  
   Assists in shock absorption during galloping and jumping.

5. **S5 (Fifth Sacral Vertebra)** – The terminal sacral segment connecting to the first caudal vertebra (Cd1).  
   Provides the structural link between the pelvis and the tail.  
   Facilitates flexibility and energy transfer between hindquarters and tail movement.

##Function##
, Provides a strong connection between the spine and pelvis.  
, Supports the weight of the hindquarters and transmits it to the limbs.  
, Stabilizes the pelvis during locomotion, rearing, or jumping.  
, Protects nerves and blood vessels passing to the hind limbs.  
, Serves as an attachment site for powerful hindquarter muscles and ligaments.

#Sternum#

##Location##
The sternum, or breastbone, lies along the midline of the underside of the chest.  
It connects the true ribs through cartilage and attaches to the first thoracic vertebra and rib pair near the front of the chest.

##Shape##
An elongated, flat bone made up of several segments (sternebrae) fused together.  
The front end forms the manubrium, while the rear end tapers toward the xiphoid cartilage.  
It serves as the central support of the thoracic floor.

##Function##
- Provides attachment for true ribs and helps form the ribcage.  
- Supports the thoracic cavity and protects internal organs beneath it.  
- Acts as a structural base for the pectoral muscles.  
- Helps maintain the shape and stability of the chest during movement and breathing.

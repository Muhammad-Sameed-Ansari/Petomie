#Sternum#

##Location##
Located along the midline of the chest, forming the floor of the thoracic cavity.  
The sternum connects the true ribs via costal cartilage and serves as the ventral support structure for the ribcage.  
In horses, the sternum is composed of several fused segments called **sternebrae**.

###Parts###
1. **Manubrium** – The cranial (front) segment of the sternum.  
   Broad and flat in shape, it provides attachment for the first pair of ribs and the sternocephalicus and pectoral muscles.  
   Acts as an anchoring point for structures of the neck and upper chest.

2. **Body of the Sternum (Corpus Sterni)** – Formed by the fusion of several sternebrae.  
   Extends caudally from the manubrium to the xiphoid process.  
   Serves as the main area of rib attachment and provides rigidity to the chest wall.  
   Protects the heart and lungs beneath it.

3. **Sternebrae (Individual Segments)** – Typically 6–8 small bones that fuse with age.  
   Contribute to flexibility in young horses and later provide strength and stability when fused.  
   Support the costal cartilage connections from the true ribs.

4. **Xiphoid Process** – The caudal (rear) end of the sternum.  
   Flat, sometimes cartilaginous in younger horses.  
   Provides attachment for abdominal muscles such as the rectus abdominis.  
   Marks the transition between the thoracic and abdominal cavities.

##Function##
 Provides structural support for the ribcage and thoracic cavity.  
 Protects the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels.  
 Serves as the main attachment point for ribs and pectoral muscles.  
 Aids in respiration by acting as a stable base during rib movement.  
 Contributes to overall rigidity and protection of the chest floor.

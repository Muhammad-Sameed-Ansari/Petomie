#Floating Rib#

##Location##
The 18th pair of ribs are the floating ribs, located at the lower end of the ribcage.  
They attach to the last thoracic vertebra but do not connect to the sternum or other ribs.

##Shape##
Shorter, thinner, and more mobile than the other ribs.  
They have a free lower end that lies within the flank area.  
Their flexibility prevents injury to the abdomen during movement.

##Function##
- Protects the upper abdominal organs near the flank area.  
- Provides flexibility and range of motion at the caudal end of the ribcage.  
- Allows the ribcage to expand and contract more freely.  
- Supports muscle attachment for breathing and body movement.

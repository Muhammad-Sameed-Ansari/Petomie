#Floating Ribs#

##Location##
Located at the caudal (rear) end of the ribcage, posterior to the false ribs.  
In horses, the **last pair of ribs (usually the 18th)** are considered floating ribs because they do not attach directly or indirectly to the sternum.  
They are connected only to the thoracic vertebrae and terminate freely in the musculature of the flank.

###Parts###
1. **Rib 18 (Floating Rib)** – The final and most caudal rib in the thoracic series.  
   Connects dorsally to the 18th thoracic vertebra (T18) but has no ventral attachment to the sternum.  
   Ends in the abdominal musculature, contributing to flexibility and flank movement.  
   Provides protection for the posterior portion of the lungs and part of the abdominal organs.

2. **Cartilaginous End (Costal Cartilage)** – Short and often reduced compared to the true ribs.  
   Embedded in muscle rather than attaching to the sternum.  
   Provides limited elasticity and allows movement during breathing and bending.

##Function##
 Protects the posterior thoracic and upper abdominal organs.  
 Provides flexibility to the rear part of the ribcage.  
 Assists in expansion and contraction of the thoracic cavity during respiration.  
 Serves as an attachment site for abdominal and intercostal muscles.  
 Contributes to mobility of the flank region and aids in body flexibility during locomotion.

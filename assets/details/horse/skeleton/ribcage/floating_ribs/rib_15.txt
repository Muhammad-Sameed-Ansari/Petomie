#Rib 15#

##Location##
Rib 15 is part of the group known as floating ribs, which typically include ribs 14 and 15.
These ribs do not attach to the sternum or to other ribs. Instead, they are anchored only to the thoracic vertebrae, giving them a free, flexible structure at the rear of the ribcage.

###Shape###
Shorter and more slender than the other ribs, curving gently toward the abdomen and ending freely without a ventral connection.

###Function###
Provide protection for the posterior organs, such as the kidneys, while allowing great flexibility of the flank area.
Energetically, they support freedom, adaptability, and release of restriction in movement and emotion.

###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Solar Plexus and Sacral Chakras.
Meridian: Liver and Gallbladder Meridians.
Emotional Meaning: Letting go, flow, and freedom of expression.
Balanced Energy: Open, unrestrained, and emotionally free.

###Common Imbalances###
Rib soreness or tightness in the flank area.
Energetically, emotional tension or resistance to release.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###
Colors: Yellow and orange encourage flow and relaxation.
Crystals: Carnelian and citrine open movement and joy.
Elements: Air and water promote release and fluidity.
Affirmation: “I am free to move, breathe, and express with ease.”

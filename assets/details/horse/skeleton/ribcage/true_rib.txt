#True Ribs#

##Location##
The true ribs are the first eight pairs of ribs attached to the thoracic vertebrae at the back and directly to the sternum at the front via costal cartilage.  
They form the upper part of the ribcage and surround the chest cavity.

##Shape##
Long, curved, and slightly flattened bones that wrap around the thorax.  
Each rib has a bony portion connected to a flexible cartilage section.  
The curvature allows the chest to expand during breathing.

##Function##
- Protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs.  
- Provides strong yet flexible support for the upper body.  
- Aids in respiration by allowing expansion of the chest cavity.  
- Serves as an attachment site for intercostal and pectoral muscles.

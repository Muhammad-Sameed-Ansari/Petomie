#True Ribs#

##Location##
Located in the thoracic region of the horse’s body, attached directly to the thoracic vertebrae and the sternum.  
Horses typically have **18 pairs of ribs**, with the **first 8 pairs classified as true ribs** because they connect directly to the sternum via costal cartilage.

###Parts###
1. **Rib 1** – The shortest and most curved rib.  
   Connects to the first thoracic vertebra (T1) and the manubrium of the sternum.  
   Provides attachment for neck and shoulder muscles, including the scalenus and serratus ventralis.

2. **Rib 2** – Slightly longer and broader than rib 1.  
   Supports the upper chest and protects major blood vessels entering the thoracic cavity.  
   Assists in stabilizing the shoulder girdle.

3. **Rib 3** – Provides attachment for pectoral and intercostal muscles.  
   Contributes to the shape and strength of the upper thoracic wall.  
   Participates in expansion and contraction during respiration.

4. **Rib 4** – Located beneath the scapula region.  
   Protects the cranial portion of the lungs and heart.  
   Serves as an anchoring point for deep thoracic muscles involved in breathing.

5. **Rib 5** – Lies midway along the chest wall.  
   Provides structural support and muscle attachment for the intercostal and abdominal regions.  
   Contributes to thoracic rigidity and flexibility during locomotion.

6. **Rib 6** – Forms part of the mid-thoracic cage.  
   Aids in lung expansion and ribcage mobility.  
   Connects to the sternum through a long, flexible cartilage joint.

7. **Rib 7** – Slightly longer and flatter.  
   Protects the middle section of the lungs and heart.  
   Supports the intercostal spaces used in breathing rhythm and stability.

8. **Rib 8** – The last true rib.  
   Marks the transition between true and false ribs.  
   Connects to the sternum through cartilage and provides muscle attachment for abdominal and thoracic muscles.

##Function##
 Protects the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels within the thoracic cavity.  
 Provides structure and stability to the chest wall.  
 Assists in breathing by expanding and contracting the thoracic cavity.  
 Serves as attachment points for intercostal, pectoral, and abdominal muscles.  
 Contributes to overall flexibility and motion during respiration and locomotion.

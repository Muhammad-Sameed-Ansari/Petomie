#Rib 10#

##Location##
Rib 10 belongs to the group known as false ribs, which include ribs 9 to 13.
Unlike the true ribs that attach directly to the sternum, the false ribs connect to each other through cartilage, ending before the sternum.
They form the flexible rear section of the ribcage, allowing movement and expansion for deep breathing.

###Shape###
Curved and slightly flattened bones that taper toward the ventral end. Their flexibility supports lung movement and spinal rotation.

###Function###
Protect the lungs and abdominal organs, support respiration, and provide elasticity to the chest wall.
Energetically, they govern flexibility, adaptability, and emotional expansion.

###Common Imbalances###

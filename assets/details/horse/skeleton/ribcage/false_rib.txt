#False Ribs#

##Location##
Located in the caudal (rear) portion of the ribcage, between the true and floating ribs.  
In horses, the **last 10 pairs of ribs (Ribs 9–18)** are considered false ribs because they do not attach directly to the sternum.  
Instead, their costal cartilages connect indirectly through the cartilage of the preceding rib, forming the costal arch.

###Parts###
1. **Rib 9** – Marks the beginning of the false ribs.  
   Attaches dorsally to the ninth thoracic vertebra (T9).  
   Ventrally connects to the cartilage of rib 8, contributing to the costal arch.  
   Provides protection for the caudal portion of the lungs and part of the diaphragm.

2. **Rib 10–Rib 14** – Middle false ribs forming the flexible lateral walls of the thorax.  
   Each connects dorsally to its corresponding thoracic vertebra.  
   Ventrally, the cartilages join the rib in front, allowing movement during respiration.  
   Provide attachment for intercostal and abdominal muscles that assist in breathing and trunk support.

3. **Rib 15–Rib 17** – Caudal false ribs located near the flank.  
   Shorter and more slanted than anterior ribs.  
   Help protect the liver, stomach, and spleen.  
   Contribute to expansion of the thoracic cavity during inhalation.

4. **Rib 18** – The last rib, often considered both a false and floating rib.  
   Attaches dorsally to T18 but lacks sternal connection.  
   Ends in the musculature of the flank, allowing flexibility in the posterior ribcage.

##Function##
 Protects vital abdominal and thoracic organs including the liver, stomach, and spleen.  
 Provides flexibility and movement to the caudal ribcage.  
 Assists in breathing by expanding and contracting the thoracic wall.  
 Serves as an attachment site for intercostal and abdominal muscles.  
 Supports the transition between the rigid thoracic region and the flexible flank area.

#False Ribs#

##Location##
The false ribs are the 9th to 17th pairs of ribs.  
They attach to the thoracic vertebrae at the back but connect to each other or to the cartilage of the true ribs rather than directly to the sternum.

##Shape##
Slightly shorter and flatter than the true ribs.  
The lower ends are connected by cartilage, forming a flexible arch.  
The false ribs still contribute to the ribcage’s protective shape.

##Function##
- Extend the protective area of the thoracic cavity.  
- Support the lungs and abdominal organs.  
- Allow chest movement during breathing through flexible connections.  
- Provide attachment points for muscles of the thorax and abdomen.

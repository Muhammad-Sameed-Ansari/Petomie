#Scapula#

##Location##
Located on the lateral side of the thorax, between the second and seventh ribs.  
The scapula is a large, flat, triangular bone forming the shoulder blade.  
It connects the forelimb to the trunk through muscles rather than a bony joint, allowing flexibility and shock absorption.

###Parts###
1. **Spine of the Scapula** – Prominent ridge on the lateral surface dividing the bone into supraspinous and infraspinous fossae.  
   Provides attachment for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

2. **Supraspinous Fossa** – Shallow depression above the spine.  
   Houses the supraspinatus muscle, which extends the shoulder joint.

3. **Infraspinous Fossa** – Larger depression below the spine.  
   Contains the infraspinatus muscle that aids in shoulder stabilization.

4. **Scapular Cartilage** – Broad cartilaginous extension along the dorsal border.  
   Increases surface area for muscle attachment and absorbs impact during movement.

5. **Glenoid Cavity** – Shallow socket at the distal end of the scapula.  
   Articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint.

6. **Supraglenoid Tubercle** – Bony prominence above the glenoid cavity.  
   Serves as the origin of the biceps brachii muscle.

7. **Coracoid Process** – Small projection near the glenoid cavity.  
   Attachment point for ligaments stabilizing the shoulder joint.

8. **Neck of the Scapula** – Narrow region between the body and glenoid cavity.  
   Marks the transition between the blade and joint area.

##Function##
 Supports the shoulder joint and forelimb attachment.  
 Provides broad surface area for muscle attachment.  
 Facilitates limb movement and shock absorption during locomotion.  
 Serves as the structural base for the forelimb’s powerful motion.  
 Contributes to flexibility, stability, and weight distribution of the upper limb.

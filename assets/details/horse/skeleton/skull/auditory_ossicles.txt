#Auditory Ossicles#

##Location##
Located within the middle ear cavity, enclosed by the temporal bone of the skull.  
The auditory ossicles form a small chain of bones connecting the tympanic membrane (eardrum) to the oval window of the inner ear.  
In horses, as in most mammals, there are **three auditory ossicles** that transmit and amplify sound vibrations.

###Parts###
1. **Malleus (Hammer)** – The largest and outermost ossicle, attached to the tympanic membrane.  
   Receives sound vibrations from the eardrum and transfers them to the incus.  
   Composed of a head, neck, and manubrium (handle) that anchors it to the membrane.  
   Converts sound waves in air into mechanical vibrations.

2. **Incus (Anvil)** – The middle bone positioned between the malleus and stapes.  
   Functions as a lever that passes vibrations efficiently from the malleus to the stapes.  
   Supported by small ligaments that maintain precise alignment for optimal sound conduction.

3. **Stapes (Stirrup)** – The smallest and innermost bone, shaped like a stirrup.  
   Its footplate fits into the oval window of the cochlea.  
   Transmits vibrations into the inner ear fluid, initiating the process of hearing.  
   Acts as a bridge between mechanical vibration and neural sound perception.

##Function##
 Transmits sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.  
 Amplifies mechanical energy for efficient auditory transmission.  
 Protects the delicate inner ear from excessive vibration via the acoustic reflex.  
 Maintains sound clarity and frequency sensitivity.  
 Enables conversion of air vibrations into fluid motion within the cochlea for auditory perception.

#Palatine Bone#

##Location##
Located at the back of the nasal cavity, forming part of the hard palate and nasal passages.  
It lies between the maxilla and the pterygoid bones, contributing to both the nasal and oral cavities.

###Parts###
1. **Horizontal Plate** – Forms the caudal part of the hard palate.  
   Fuses with the opposite palatine bone along the midline.  
   Separates the nasal passages from the oral cavity.

2. **Perpendicular Plate** – Extends dorsally into the nasal cavity.  
   Contributes to the wall of the nasal passage and the orbital floor.  
   Provides surface for muscle and mucosal attachment.

##Function##
 Forms part of the hard palate that separates nasal and oral cavities.  
 Supports nasal structures and contributes to airflow regulation.  
 Provides attachment for soft tissues and mucous membranes.  
 Assists in maintaining skull rigidity and structural balance.

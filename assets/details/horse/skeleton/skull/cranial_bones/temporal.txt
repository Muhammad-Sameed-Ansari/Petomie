#Temporal Bone#

##Location##
Located on each side of the skull, below the parietal bones and behind the zygomatic bones.  
Forms part of the skull base and the sides of the cranium.

###Parts###
1. **Squamous Part** – Flat portion contributing to the side of the skull.  
   Articulates with the mandible to form the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

2. **Tympanic Part** – Surrounds the external acoustic meatus (ear canal).  
   Houses structures of the middle ear.

3. **Petrous Part** – Dense internal section containing the cochlea and semicircular canals.  
   Protects inner ear structures responsible for hearing and balance.

4. **Zygomatic Process** – Projects forward to meet the zygomatic bone, forming part of the zygomatic arch.  
   Provides attachment for the masseter muscle.

##Function##
 Houses and protects the ear structures.  
 Forms the TMJ and supports jaw movement.  
 Provides attachment points for head and neck muscles.  
 Contributes to sound transmission and balance control.

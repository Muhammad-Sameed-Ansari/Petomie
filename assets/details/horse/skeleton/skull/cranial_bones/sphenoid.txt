#Sphenoid Bone#

##Location##
Located at the base of the skull, between the occipital and ethmoid bones.  
Forms part of the cranial floor and the sides of the skull base.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – Central portion forming part of the cranial floor.  
   Houses the sphenoid sinus and supports the brain above it.

2. **Greater Wings** – Extend outward from the body.  
   Form part of the skull’s lateral wall and contain openings for nerves and vessels.

3. **Pterygoid Processes** – Project downward from the sphenoid.  
   Provide attachment for pterygoid muscles that control jaw motion.

4. **Optic Canal** – Passage through which the optic nerve exits the skull.  
   Connects the brain to the eye.

##Function##
 Supports the base of the brain and protects cranial nerves.  
 Provides muscle attachment for jaw and facial movement.  
 Contributes to the structure of the cranial cavity and skull stability.

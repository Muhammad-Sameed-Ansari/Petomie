#Ethmoid Bone#

##Location##
Located between the nasal cavity and the brain cavity, forming part of the cranial floor and nasal septum.  
Situated in front of the sphenoid bone and behind the nasal bones.

###Parts###
1. **Cribriform Plate** – Perforated structure forming part of the cranial floor.  
   Allows passage of olfactory nerves from the nasal cavity to the brain.

2. **Perpendicular Plate** – Vertical structure forming part of the nasal septum.  
   Divides the nasal cavity into left and right passages.

3. **Ethmoidal Labyrinth** – Network of delicate air cells that form the ethmoidal sinus.  
   Lined with mucosa to filter and humidify inhaled air.

##Function##
 Supports the nasal cavity and separates it from the brain.  
 Allows olfactory nerve transmission for the sense of smell.  
 Contributes to airflow regulation and lightens the skull through sinus cavities.

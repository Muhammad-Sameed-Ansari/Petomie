#Cranial Bones#

##Location##
Form the upper and posterior portion of the skull, enclosing and protecting the brain. In the horse, the cranial bones form the braincase and articulate with the facial bones at the front and the cervical spine at the back.

##Shape##
Composed of multiple flat and irregular bones fused together by sutures. Major cranial bones include:
- **Frontal:** Forms the forehead and upper part of the orbit.
- **Parietal:** Forms the sides and roof of the cranium.
- **Occipital:** Forms the back and base of the skull; articulates with the atlas (C1).
- **Temporal:** Houses the ear structures and forms the side of the skull.
- **Sphenoid and Ethmoid:** Form the base and internal part of the cranial cavity, supporting brain and sensory structures.

##Function##
Protects the brain and sensory organs (eyes, ears, and olfactory structures)
Provides attachment for facial and neck muscles
Forms the cranial cavity for housing the brain and meninges
Supports the upper airway and provides passage for cranial nerves and blood vessels
Contributes to the skull’s overall shape and balance

#Occipital Bone#

##Location##
Forms the back and base of the skull.  
Located caudally, articulating with the atlas (first cervical vertebra) at the atlanto-occipital joint.

###Parts###
1. **Foramen Magnum** – Large opening allowing passage of the spinal cord.  
   Connects the brain to the spinal canal.

2. **Occipital Condyles** – Smooth, rounded projections on either side of the foramen magnum.  
   Articulate with the atlas to enable head nodding movement.

3. **Nuchal Crest** – Prominent ridge along the upper border of the occipital bone.  
   Provides attachment for neck and nuchal ligaments.

4. **Basilar Part** – Extends forward beneath the brain cavity.  
   Supports brain structures and connects with the sphenoid bone.

##Function##
 Protects the hindbrain and forms the skull’s posterior base.  
 Provides articulation with the first cervical vertebra.  
 Serves as attachment for neck muscles and ligaments.  
 Supports head movement and structural stability.

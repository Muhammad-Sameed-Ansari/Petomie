#Mandible#

##Location##
Located in the lower part of the skull, forming the lower jaw of the horse.  
It is the largest and strongest bone of the skull and articulates with the temporal bones at the temporomandibular joints (TMJ).  
The mandible supports the lower teeth and plays a vital role in chewing, balance, and communication.

###Parts###
1. **Body of the Mandible** – The horizontal portion forming the base of the jaw.  
   Houses the lower teeth within the alveolar sockets.  
   Contains the mandibular canal that carries blood vessels and nerves.  
   Merges at the midline in a region called the mandibular symphysis.

2. **Ramus of the Mandible** – The vertical extension of the bone on each side.  
   Provides attachment for chewing muscles such as the masseter and pterygoid.  
   Connects the lower jaw to the skull through the temporomandibular joint.

3. **Coronoid Process** – The dorsal (upper) projection of the ramus.  
   Serves as the attachment site for the temporal muscle, assisting in raising the jaw during chewing.

4. **Condylar Process** – Rounded projection at the caudal end of the ramus.  
   Articulates with the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone to form the TMJ.  
   Allows smooth hinge and sliding movements during mastication.

5. **Mandibular Notch** – The curved depression between the coronoid and condylar processes.  
   Provides passage for blood vessels and nerves supplying the jaw.

6. **Mandibular Angle** – The caudal, lower corner where the body and ramus meet.  
   Serves as a major muscle attachment site for the masseter and digastric muscles.  
   Plays a role in jaw stability and strength.

7. **Mental Foramen** – Openings on the lateral surface of the mandible near the premolars.  
   Allow passage of nerves and vessels to the lips and chin.

##Function##
 Supports the lower teeth and facilitates chewing and grinding of food.  
 Provides structural framework for muscles of mastication.  
 Enables movement of the jaw for biting, chewing, and communication.  
 Protects nerves and blood vessels of the lower face.  
 Contributes to the balance and symmetry of the skull.

#Hyoid Apparatus#

##Location##
Located in the throat region, suspended between the mandible and the larynx.  
The hyoid apparatus supports the tongue, pharynx, and larynx, allowing coordinated swallowing, breathing, and vocalization.  
It is a delicate bony structure made up of paired and unpaired bones connected by joints and cartilage.

###Parts###
1. **Basihyoid Bone** – The central, unpaired bone of the hyoid apparatus.  
   Positioned transversely between the mandibular rami.  
   Serves as the anchor point for other hyoid bones and supports the base of the tongue.  
   Contains a small projection called the lingual process that extends into the root of the tongue.

2. **Thyrohyoid Bones (2)** – Paired bones that extend caudally from the basihyoid to the larynx.  
   Connect to the thyroid cartilage via cartilage or ligament.  
   Help stabilize the larynx during swallowing and vocalization.

3. **Ceratohyoid Bones (2)** – Small paired bones connecting the basihyoid to the epihyoid.  
   Provide structural linkage within the apparatus and flexibility for tongue and laryngeal movement.

4. **Epihyoid Bones (2)** – Slender bones connecting the ceratohyoid and stylohyoid bones.  
   Often small or partially fused with adjacent segments in mature horses.  
   Serve as an articulation point between the mid and upper hyoid segments.

5. **Stylohyoid Bones (2)** – The longest bones of the hyoid apparatus.  
   Extend dorsally and cranially to attach near the base of the skull at the stylohyoid process.  
   Provide strong support for the tongue and pharynx and serve as a hinge for swallowing motion.

6. **Lingual Process** – A bony projection extending rostrally from the basihyoid into the tongue base.  
   Strengthens the tongue and contributes to its mobility and stability during eating and vocalization.

##Function##
 Supports the tongue and larynx for coordinated swallowing and vocalization.  
 Provides attachment sites for muscles of the tongue, pharynx, and larynx.  
 Maintains alignment between the mouth and throat structures.  
 Assists in airway control during respiration.  
 Enables the horse to perform precise movements of the tongue and jaw during chewing and communication.

#Phalanges#

##Location##
Extend distally from the metacarpus to form the lower part of the limb (digit).  
Horses have one functional digit per limb, consisting of three phalanges aligned vertically below the cannon bone.

##Shape##
- **First Phalanx (P1, Long Pastern Bone):** elongated, cylindrical bone between the fetlock and pastern joints.  
- **Second Phalanx (P2, Short Pastern Bone):** shorter, wedge-shaped bone between the pastern and coffin joints.  
- **Third Phalanx (P3, Coffin Bone):** triangular, flattened bone enclosed within the hoof capsule.

##Function##
Provide structure and leverage to the distal limb.  
Support body weight and absorb shock during locomotion.  
Serve as attachment sites for tendons and ligaments that control flexion, extension, and stabilization of the limb.  
P3 forms the framework for the hoof and bears much of the body’s weight during stance.

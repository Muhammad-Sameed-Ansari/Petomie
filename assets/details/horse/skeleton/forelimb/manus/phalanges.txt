#Phalanges#

##Location##
Located below the fetlock joint, forming the digit of the forelimb.  
The horse’s forelimb has one functional digit composed of three phalanges arranged vertically between the fetlock and hoof.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal Phalanx (Long Pastern Bone)** – The first bone below the fetlock joint.  
   Articulates with the metacarpal (cannon) bone and middle phalanx.  
   Provides leverage and flexibility for fetlock and pastern motion.

2. **Middle Phalanx (Short Pastern Bone)** – Situated between the long pastern and coffin bone.  
   Short and strong, forming the pastern joint.  
   Absorbs impact and supports the weight of the limb.

3. **Distal Phalanx (Coffin Bone)** – The terminal bone enclosed within the hoof capsule.  
   Provides the foundation for the hoof and attachment for the deep digital flexor tendon.  
   Forms the coffin joint with the short pastern and the navicular bone.

##Function##
 Form the skeletal structure of the forefoot.  
 Enable flexion and extension during stride.  
 Support the hoof and bear weight during impact.  
 Provide attachment for tendons and ligaments essential for stability and propulsion.

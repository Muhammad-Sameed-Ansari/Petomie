#Sesamoids#

##Location##
Located at the distal end of the metacarpus and at the distal interphalangeal joint.  
The **proximal sesamoid bones** are found at the back of the fetlock joint (metacarpophalangeal joint), one on each side of the distal end of the third metacarpal (cannon bone).  
The **distal sesamoid bone (navicular bone)** lies behind the distal interphalangeal joint between the second and third phalanges.

##Shape##
- **Proximal sesamoids:** small, wedge-shaped bones embedded within the suspensory ligament.  
- **Distal sesamoid (navicular):** boat-shaped, flat bone that sits behind the coffin joint.

##Function##
Act as pulleys for flexor tendons, reducing friction and stress during movement.  
Assist in distributing pressure within the fetlock and coffin joints.  
Play a key role in the **stay apparatus**, supporting the limb during weight bearing and preventing overextension of the joints.

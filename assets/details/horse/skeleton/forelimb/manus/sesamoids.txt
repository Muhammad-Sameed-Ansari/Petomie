#Sesamoid Bones#

##Location##
Located at the major joint regions of the forelimb, particularly at the fetlock and coffin joints.  
Sesamoid bones are embedded within tendons to reduce friction and enhance joint function.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal Sesamoid Bones (2 per limb)** – Found at the back of the fetlock joint behind the metacarpophalangeal articulation.  
   Embedded in the suspensory ligament and act as pulleys for the flexor tendons.  
   Distribute stress and prevent hyperextension of the fetlock.

2. **Distal Sesamoid Bone (Navicular Bone)** – Located behind the coffin joint between the short and distal phalanges.  
   Provides a smooth surface for the deep digital flexor tendon.  
   Reduces friction and assists in the flexion of the lower limb.

##Function##
 Improve tendon efficiency and joint stability.  
 Reduce wear on tendons and ligaments during movement.  
 Act as levers that enhance flexion and propulsion.  
 Protect joints from excessive stress and impact.

#Metacarpals#

##Location##
Located between the carpus (knee) and the fetlock joint in the horse’s forelimb.  
The metacarpal region forms the cannon area and provides the main structural support for the front limb.

###Parts###
1. **Third Metacarpal (Cannon Bone)** – The largest and weight-bearing bone of the forelimb.  
   Extends from the distal row of carpal bones to the proximal phalanx.  
   Articulates proximally with the carpus and distally with the sesamoid bones and long pastern.  
   Serves as the main shaft transmitting force during locomotion.

2. **Second and Fourth Metacarpals (Splint Bones)** – Slender bones located on each side of the cannon bone.  
   Run parallel to the cannon bone and taper toward the distal end.  
   Provide lateral support and help stabilize the forelimb.  
   Fuse partially with the cannon bone in mature horses.

##Function##
 Support and transfer weight from the upper limb to the lower limb.  
 Provide attachment for suspensory ligaments and interosseous structures.  
 Maintain limb alignment and absorb shock during movement.  
 Contribute to stability and flexibility of the fetlock joint.

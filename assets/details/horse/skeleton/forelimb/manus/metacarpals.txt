#Metacarpals#

##Location##
Located between the carpus (knee) and the fetlock joint.  
Consists of one large central bone (third metacarpal) and two smaller, vestigial bones on either side.

##Shape##
- **Third Metacarpal (Cannon Bone):** large, cylindrical bone forming the main shaft of the lower limb.  
- **Second and Fourth Metacarpals (Medial and Lateral Splint Bones):** slender rods attached to the sides of the cannon bone, tapering distally.

##Function##
Support the upper limb and transmit forces between the carpus and phalanges.  
Provide attachment sites for ligaments, tendons, and the suspensory apparatus.  
The cannon bone bears most of the weight, while the splint bones add lateral stability and serve as remnants of ancestral multiple digits.

#Radius#

##Location##
Located in the forelimb between the elbow (humerus) above and the carpus (knee) below.  
The radius is the main weight-bearing bone of the forearm, forming the foundation for stability and motion.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal End** – The upper portion articulating with the humerus at the elbow joint.  
   Includes the **radial head**, which fits into the humeral condyle, and the **radial tuberosity**, providing attachment for the biceps brachii muscle.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – The long, slightly curved middle section of the bone.  
   Provides strength and stability for weight bearing.  
   Serves as the attachment site for forearm muscles.

3. **Distal End** – The lower portion articulating with the carpal bones.  
   Forms part of the radiocarpal (knee) joint.  
   Includes the **styloid process**, which stabilizes the carpus and provides attachment for ligaments.

##Function##
 Forms the main structure of the forearm and supports body weight.  
 Articulates with the humerus and carpus for limb flexion and extension.  
 Provides attachment for muscles controlling the forelimb.  
 Transmits forces from the upper limb to the knee.  
 Stabilizes the forelimb during locomotion and impact.

#Radius#

##Location##
Located in the forelimb between the elbow and the carpus (knee).  
Lies cranial (in front of) and fused with the ulna for most of its length.  
Forms the main weight-bearing bone of the forearm.

##Shape##
Strong, cylindrical bone slightly flattened craniocaudally.  
The **proximal end** articulates with the humerus at the elbow joint.  
The **distal end** articulates with the proximal row of carpal bones.  
The bone widens distally for stability and support during load-bearing.

##Function##
Serves as the **primary weight-bearing bone** of the forearm.  
Transmits forces from the humerus to the carpus during locomotion.  
Provides broad surfaces for muscular attachment and stabilizes the elbow and carpal joints.  
Supports flexion and extension of the forelimb with minimal rotation due to fusion with the ulna.

#Ulna#

##Location##
Located in the forelimb alongside the radius, extending from the elbow joint to the mid-forearm.  
In the horse, the ulna is partly fused with the radius, forming a single composite structure that supports limited rotation but strong stability.

###Parts###
1. **Olecranon Process** – The large projection at the upper end of the ulna forming the point of the elbow.  
   Serves as the attachment site for the triceps brachii muscle, enabling powerful limb extension.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – The elongated portion that tapers toward the middle of the radius.  
   Fused with the radius in the mid and distal regions.  
   Provides structural support for the forelimb.

3. **Distal End** – The lower part of the ulna that becomes narrow and indistinct as it merges with the radius.  
   Contributes to joint stability and transmits forces from the elbow to the radius.

##Function##
 Acts as a lever arm for the triceps muscle during elbow extension.  
 Strengthens the forearm and stabilizes the elbow joint.  
 Supports muscle attachment and transmits force to the radius.  
 Provides structure and rigidity to the forelimb during movement.  
 Contributes to flexion, extension, and shock absorption at the elbow joint.

#Ulna#

##Location##
Situated on the caudal (back) side of the forelimb, partially fused with the radius.  
Extends from the elbow joint, forming part of the olecranon process, and tapers distally as it merges with the radius in the mid to lower forelimb.

##Shape##
Long, slender bone that is incomplete in the horse.  
The **proximal end** forms the **olecranon**, which is a large, prominent projection serving as the point of the elbow.  
The **shaft** is thin and narrow, gradually fading and becoming fused with the radius.  
The **distal portion** is reduced or absent, leaving the ulna non-weight-bearing.

##Function##
Forms the **point of the elbow**, providing leverage for the triceps muscle during limb extension.  
Acts as a stabilizer for the elbow joint.  
Although largely fused and reduced, it retains an important role in attachment for muscles controlling elbow movement.

#Distal Row#

##Location##  
The distal carpal row lies at the **lower level of the horse’s carpus**, positioned **between the proximal carpal row** (above) and the **metacarpal bones/cannon region** (below).  
It forms the “bridge” that channels movement and load into the lower limb.

###Shape###  
A **tight row of smaller, squared bones** designed for **precise gliding and alignment**, helping the knee stay stable while moving.

###Parts###  

##Second Carpal Bone##  
Sits on the inner side, supporting medial stability and alignment.  
Energetically, represents **inner alignment and steady progress**.

##Third Carpal Bone##  
Central weight-bearing bone, commonly involved in high-impact stress.  
Energetically, symbolizes **core strength and responsibility in action**.

##Fourth Carpal Bone##  
Outer-side bone supporting lateral stability and balanced loading.  
Energetically, reflects **balance, boundaries, and coordinated movement**.

##First Carpal Bone (Often Absent/Small in Horses)##  
If present, a small medial bone with limited functional role.  
Energetically, represents **fine adjustments and subtle support**.

###Function###  
Transfers force from the upper carpus into the cannon region, supports joint stability, and allows controlled motion during stride, landing, and turns.  
Energetically, governs **coordination, follow-through, and moving with purpose without strain**.

###Energetic Connection###  
**Chakra:** Root and Solar Plexus Chakras.  
**Meridian:** Large Intestine and Lung Meridians.  
**Emotional Meaning:** Coordination, confidence in action, and healthy boundaries in effort.  
**Balanced Energy:** Smooth follow-through with strong, grounded direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Carpal soreness, chip fractures (especially with speed/turning), joint inflammation, arthritis, and strain from uneven loading.  
Energetically, **overexertion**, pushing through discomfort, or feeling “out of alignment” with direction.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###  
Support straightness and balance (gentle lateral work, even footing, appropriate rest) and calm breathing during rehab.  
**Colors:** Yellow and earthy brown restore confidence and stability.  
**Crystals:** Citrine (steady confidence) and smoky quartz (grounding release).  
**Elements:** Earth and fire balance endurance with smart, measured effort.  
**Affirmation:** “My movement is aligned, coordinated, and strong.”

#Carpus (Distal Row)#

##Location##
The distal row of the carpal bones is located in the lower part of the horse’s carpus (knee joint), just above the cannon bone (metacarpal region).  
It lies below the proximal carpal row and articulates with the top of the large metacarpal (cannon) and small splint bones.

##Shape##
The distal row of the carpus consists of three main bones (sometimes four if the first carpal bone is present):  
- **Second carpal bone (C2)** – located on the inside (medial side), articulating with the second metacarpal (medial splint bone).  
- **Third carpal bone (C3)** – the largest bone in the row, centrally positioned, articulating with the large third metacarpal (cannon bone).  
- **Fourth carpal bone (C4)** – on the outside (lateral side), articulating with the fourth metacarpal (lateral splint bone) and part of the cannon.  
- **First carpal bone (C1)** – small and inconsistently present, sometimes absent or fused.

##Function##
- Forms the lower portion of the knee joint, connecting the forelimb to the metacarpals.  
- Provides articulation and shock absorption during leg flexion and extension.  
- Supports weight transfer from the upper limb to the lower limb.  
- Allows smooth movement and stability in the carpal joint during locomotion.  
- Distributes pressure evenly between the radius and the metacarpals.

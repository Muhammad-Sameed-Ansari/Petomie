#Distal Row of Tarsal Bones#

##Location##
Located in the lower section of the hock joint, between the central tarsal bone above and the metatarsal bones below.  
This row forms the lower portion of the tarsus and contributes to flexibility and load distribution during movement.

###Parts###
1. **First and Second Tarsal Bones (Often Fused)** – The smallest bones on the medial side.  
   Articulate with the central tarsal bone above and the second metatarsal bone below.  
   Provide medial stability and flexibility in the hock.

2. **Third Tarsal Bone** – Central bone of the distal row.  
   Articulates with the central tarsal bone above and the third metatarsal (cannon) bone below.  
   Transmits much of the weight through the hock and aids in smooth motion.

3. **Fourth Tarsal Bone** – The largest and most lateral of the distal row.  
   Extends upward to articulate with both the calcaneus and central tarsal bones.  
   Connects below with the fourth metatarsal bone.  
   Provides lateral stability and contributes to strength and shock absorption.

##Function##
 Connect the mid and lower portions of the hock to the metatarsals.  
 Allow flexibility, strength, and weight transfer during locomotion.  
 Support smooth articulation and energy flow through the hindlimb.  
 Maintain balance and even force distribution between the medial and lateral sides of the hock.

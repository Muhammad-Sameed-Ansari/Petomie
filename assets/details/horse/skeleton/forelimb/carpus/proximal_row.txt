#Proximal Row#

##Location##  
The proximal carpal row sits at the **top of the horse’s carpus (knee/wrist)**, positioned **between the distal radius** (above) and the **distal carpal row** (below).  
It forms the main “receiving” surface for weight coming down the forelimb and helps guide smooth flexion and extension.

###Shape###  
A **compact row of small, block-like bones** with smooth joint surfaces, built for **stability under load** while allowing controlled glide.

###Parts###  

##Radial Carpal Bone##  
Largest proximal bone on the inner side, supporting major weight transfer.  
Energetically, represents **inner stability and reliable support**.

##Intermediate Carpal Bone##  
Central bone that helps distribute force across the joint.  
Energetically, symbolizes **balance and adaptability under pressure**.

##Ulnar Carpal Bone##  
Outer-side bone contributing to lateral stability and joint alignment.  
Energetically, reflects **boundaries and steady direction**.

##Accessory Carpal Bone##  
Projects backward on the outer side (palmar aspect), acting as a lever for tendons/ligaments.  
Energetically, represents **protection, resilience, and safe strength**.

###Function###  
Absorbs and distributes impact from the radius into the carpus, supports weight-bearing, and allows smooth, controlled motion during movement and landing.  
Energetically, governs **stability, trust in movement, and carrying responsibility with ease**.

###Energetic Connection###  
**Chakra:** Root and Heart Chakras.  
**Meridian:** Lung and Large Intestine Meridians (forelimb pathways).  
**Emotional Meaning:** Support, boundaries, and confidence to move forward safely.  
**Balanced Energy:** Strong foundations with flexible responsiveness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Chip fractures, bruising, carpal osteoarthritis, ligament strain, or inflammation from repetitive impact.  
Energetically, **fear of moving forward**, carrying “too much,” or rigidity under pressure.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###  
Encourage slow, controlled flexion/extension and gentle pole work to rebuild trust in motion.  
**Colors:** Deep red and soft green support grounding and safe openness.  
**Crystals:** Hematite (grounding) and green aventurine (renewal).  
**Elements:** Earth and air balance steadiness with ease.  
**Affirmation:** “I am supported, steady, and safe as I move forward.”

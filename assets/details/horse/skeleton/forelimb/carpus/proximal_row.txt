#Proximal Row of Tarsal Bones#

##Location##
Located at the upper portion of the hock joint, between the tibia and fibula above and the central and distal tarsal bones below.  
The proximal row of the horse’s tarsus consists of two major bones — the talus and the calcaneus — which form the upper hinge of the hock and provide strength and leverage to the hindlimb.

###Parts###
1. **Talus (Tibial Tarsal Bone)** – The medial and dorsal bone of the proximal row.  
   Articulates with the tibia at the tibio-tarsal joint.  
   Possesses a pulley-shaped trochlea that guides flexion and extension of the hock.  
   Transmits the body’s weight from the leg to the lower tarsal bones.

2. **Calcaneus (Fibular Tarsal Bone)** – The lateral and posterior bone forming the heel or point of the hock.  
   Extends upward and backward to form the calcaneal tuber, the attachment site for the Achilles tendon.  
   Articulates with the talus medially and the fourth tarsal bone distally.  
   Provides leverage and mechanical advantage for the powerful flexor muscles of the hindlimb.

##Function##
 Form the upper joint of the hock, enabling hinge-like motion.  
 Support body weight and transmit force from the leg to the foot.  
 Provide leverage for propulsion and shock absorption.  
 Serve as attachment points for key tendons and ligaments.  
 Maintain strength and stability of the hock during locomotion.

#Carpus (Proximal Row)#

##Location##
The proximal row of the carpal bones is located in the upper part of the horse’s carpus (knee joint), between the radius (forearm bone) and the distal carpal row.  
It forms the upper section of the knee and articulates directly with the distal end of the radius.

##Shape##
The proximal row of the carpus contains four bones arranged side by side:  
- **Radial carpal bone** – the largest bone, located on the medial (inner) side beneath the radius.  
- **Intermediate carpal bone** – lies between the radial and ulnar carpal bones, sharing articulation with the radius above and the second and third carpals below.  
- **Ulnar carpal bone** – smaller, on the lateral (outer) side beneath the ulna, articulating with the fourth carpal below.  
- **Accessory carpal bone** – a distinct, round bone projecting backward from the lateral side of the joint, forming the point of attachment for several ligaments and tendons.

##Function##
- Forms the upper portion of the carpal (knee) joint, enabling forelimb flexion and extension.  
- Absorbs concussion and distributes forces from the radius to the lower carpal bones.  
- Provides attachment for tendons and ligaments that stabilize the carpus.  
- The accessory carpal bone acts as a lever for muscles and tendons, aiding in limb movement.  
- Contributes to the strength, support, and flexibility of the horse’s forelimb.

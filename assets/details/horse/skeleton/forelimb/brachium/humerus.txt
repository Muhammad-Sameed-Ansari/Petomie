#Humerus#

##Location##
Located in the upper forelimb between the scapula (shoulder blade) and the radius and ulna (forearm bones).  
The humerus forms the foundation of the upper limb, articulating proximally with the scapula at the shoulder joint and distally with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.

###Parts###
1. **Head** – Rounded proximal end of the humerus.  
   Articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the shoulder joint.  
   Allows smooth flexion and extension of the limb.

2. **Neck** – Slightly narrowed region below the head.  
   Serves as the transition between the head and shaft, providing attachment for the joint capsule.

3. **Greater Tubercle** – Large projection beside the head on the lateral side.  
   Serves as a strong attachment point for shoulder muscles, including the supraspinatus and infraspinatus.

4. **Lesser Tubercle** – Smaller projection on the medial side of the head.  
   Provides attachment for the subscapularis muscle, which stabilizes the shoulder joint.

5. **Intermediate Tubercle** – Unique to horses, located between the greater and lesser tubercles.  
   Provides additional muscle attachment and contributes to shoulder stability.

6. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, cylindrical portion connecting the proximal and distal ends.  
   Provides attachment for major muscles of the shoulder and upper forelimb, including the brachialis and triceps brachii.

7. **Deltoid Tuberosity** – Prominent lateral ridge on the upper shaft.  
   Serves as the attachment site for the deltoid muscle, enabling limb flexion and abduction.

8. **Distal End** – Lower portion articulating with the radius and ulna to form the elbow joint.  
   Features:  
   - **Condyle**: Rounded articular surface for the radius.  
   - **Epicondyles**: Medial and lateral projections providing attachment for flexor and extensor muscles.  
   - **Olecranon Fossa**: Depression that accommodates the olecranon process of the ulna during limb extension.

##Function##
 Forms the main structure of the upper forelimb.  
 Connects the shoulder to the forearm and transmits muscular force.  
 Provides attachment for major muscles involved in flexion, extension, and rotation.  
 Supports weight bearing and movement during walking, running, and jumping.  
 Enables strength and flexibility of the forelimb through coordinated joint motion.

#Core Supplements#

Supplements can provide nutritional and energetic support when chosen carefully. They focus on supporting the body’s natural processes through nutrients, herbs, and plant-based compounds.

When working with horses, supplements should always be introduced thoughtfully, with attention to dosage, individual sensitivity, and professional guidance. Supplements may also be tested energetically to identify current support needs.

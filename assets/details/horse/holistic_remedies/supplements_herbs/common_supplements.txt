#Common Supplements#

Supplements are commonly used to support horses nutritionally and physically, depending on workload, age, environment, and individual needs. Horses are herbivores and often respond best to plant-based support that works gently with their natural systems.

In holistic practice, supplements may also be tested energetically to determine what support is most appropriate at a given time.

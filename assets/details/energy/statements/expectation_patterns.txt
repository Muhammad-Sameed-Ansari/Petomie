#Expectation Patterns#

Expectation patterns are anticipatory projections of what the system expects will occur based on prior experience, conditioning, or repeated outcomes
They shape perception, readiness, and response before anything actually happens
Expectations are not beliefs. They are forecasts the system prepares for in order to reduce uncertainty and maintain safety

##Expectation pulls the future into the present##

###Common Effects###
Pre-emptive tension or guarding
Anticipatory stress or vigilance

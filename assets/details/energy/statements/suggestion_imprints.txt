#Negative Suggestion Imprints#

Negative Suggestion imprints are external inputs that were heard, felt, sensed, or perceived and taken in as truth without conscious evaluation
They form when information is received during heightened sensitivity, authority dynamics, emotional charge, or lack of filtering
NSI are received meanings that the system accepts as real before testing or direct experience occurs

The entries describe suggestions the system received, not what is inherently true
A suggestion reflects a meaning that was absorbed (e.g. “being seen = unsafe”), often through tone, emotion, or environment

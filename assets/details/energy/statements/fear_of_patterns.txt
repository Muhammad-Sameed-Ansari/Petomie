#Fear Of Patterns#

Fear of patterns are recurring survival-based imprints that activate when a perceived threat is anticipated rather than present.
They form when the system learns to expect danger, loss, or harm and begins to respond in advance
Once formed, fear of patterns no longer require an actual threat to be active
The anticipation alone is enough to trigger the response.

##Fear pulls anticipated threat into the present##

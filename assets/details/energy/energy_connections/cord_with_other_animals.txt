#Relationships and bonds with other animals#

##How Cords Form##
Through intense experiences (trauma, fear, abuse, rescue situations).
Through repeated interactions (feeding, training, living together).                                    

##Negative / Unhealthy Cords##
Energetic dependency (animal absorbs other owners stress constantly).
Trauma cords (past abuse or neglect still ""hooked"" into the animal).
Over-control (cords tying down freedom of expression).
Can drain life force, cause behavioral issues, or weaken immune system.

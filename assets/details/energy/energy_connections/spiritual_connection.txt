#Spiritual awareness and higher connections beyond the physical#

Animals naturally have a stronger link to spiritual awareness than most humans, because they live in the present moment.
They can often sense energy shifts, spirits, or danger before humans do.
Rescue animals may carry a spiritual “mission” with their humans — often coming into their lives for healing, teaching, or companionship at exactly the right time.

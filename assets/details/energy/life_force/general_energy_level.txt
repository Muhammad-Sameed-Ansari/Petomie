#General Energy Level#

##Location##
Flows through every layer of the animal’s being — physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.
Most noticeably expressed through body posture, eye brightness, breathing rhythm, and general vitality.
Energetically centered within the solar plexus and distributed through the meridians and chakras to sustain overall life force.

###Shape###
Appears as a vibrant inner glow or pulse radiating outward from the body’s core.
When balanced, the flow is smooth, strong, and rhythmic.
When depleted, it becomes dull, uneven, or slow, often visible in behavior and energy expression.

##Function##
Reflects the total amount of vital energy (Chi, Prana, or Life Force) available to the body and energy systems.
Maintains strength, alertness, emotional stability, and resilience.
Supports immune response, muscle tone, and recovery.
Indicates the body’s ability to adapt to stress and environmental changes.

##Energetic Function##
Regulates flow through the main energy centers and meridians.
Balances yin and yang forces (activity and rest, giving and receiving).
Provides energy for cellular repair, organ function, and intuitive awareness.
Connects the physical form to Earth’s grounding energy and universal life energy.

##Spiritual Connection##
When an animal’s general energy level is balanced, it exudes calm strength and presence.
The being is aligned, vibrant, and connected to both Earth and spirit, allowing natural healing and intuitive harmony to occur.
Low or excessive energy levels indicate imbalance in the life force flow and can be harmonized through rest, grounding, nutrition, and energetic healing.

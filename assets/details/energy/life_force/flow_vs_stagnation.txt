#Energy Flow vs Stagnation#

##Location##
Flows through the meridians, chakras, and auric layers of the animal’s energetic body.
This current of life force energy (Chi or Prana) connects all physical organs and energetic systems, ensuring balance and communication between body, mind, and spirit.

###Shape###
When flowing freely, energy moves in smooth, rhythmic waves or spirals, circulating evenly throughout the body.
When stagnant, it appears as dense or blocked areas — still, dark, or heavy zones in the energetic field where movement is restricted.

##Function##
Energy Flow
Distributes life force evenly through the body and aura.
Maintains vitality, emotional stability, and mental clarity.
Supports self-healing, proper organ function, and smooth movement.
Encourages openness, playfulness, and natural curiosity.
Energy Stagnation
Occurs when energy stops moving due to stress, trauma, fear, or physical restriction.
Can lead to fatigue, discomfort, restlessness, or behavioral imbalance.
Often manifests as tension, shallow breathing, or repetitive habits.

##Energetic Function##
Balanced flow nourishes tissues, chakras, and meridians with fresh life force.
Stagnation traps unprocessed emotions and low vibrations, blocking the body’s natural healing capacity.
Flow can be restored through grounding, movement, breathwork, bodywork, or emotional release.

##Spiritual Connection##
Free energy flow represents alignment with universal life force — the animal feels vibrant, centered, and connected to nature.
When stagnation clears, the spirit expands, awareness heightens, and communication between body and soul becomes fluid again.
Flow equals life; stagnation equals energetic pause — restoring movement returns balance and vitality to the entire being.

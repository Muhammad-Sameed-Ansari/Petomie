#Energy Overload vs Depletion#

##Location##
Occurs within the entire energetic system, including the chakras, meridians, aura, and nervous system.
These states reflect how much life force energy the animal is generating, holding, or releasing at any given time.

###Shape###
Overload: Energy appears dense, bright, or chaotic, often concentrated around the head, chest, or limbs. The flow is excessive and ungrounded.
Depletion: Energy appears dim, weak, or fragmented, with slow movement and gaps in the aura or meridians.

##Function##
###Overload###
Results from absorbing too much external or emotional energy (from humans, environments, or stress).
Leads to hyperactivity, tension, restlessness, sensitivity, or irritability.
The body may feel “buzzing,” hot, or on edge, showing difficulty grounding excess charge.
Indicates imbalance between input and grounding — too much energy without proper release.
###Depletion###
Results from exhaustion, trauma, poor nourishment, emotional suppression, or prolonged stress.
Causes fatigue, weakness, lack of motivation, or emotional flatness.
The animal may become withdrawn, cold, or unresponsive, conserving remaining energy.
Reflects insufficient intake or retention of life force to sustain equilibrium.

##Energetic Function##
Overload requires grounding, calming, and energy release through rest, contact with Earth, or gentle movement.
Depletion requires replenishment through nourishment, sunlight, sleep, and energy healing.
Both conditions disturb the natural rhythm of energy exchange between the body and environment.
Restoration occurs when inflow and outflow of energy are balanced — not too open, not too closed.

##Spiritual Connection##
Balanced energy creates harmony between Earth (grounding) and Spirit (inspiration).
Overload indicates disconnection from grounding and excessive upper chakra activity; depletion shows reduced life force and low vibration.
When equilibrium is restored, the animal’s spirit shines naturally — calm, vibrant, and connected to universal flow without excess or lack.

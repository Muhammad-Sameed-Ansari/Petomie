#Nervous System Distortions#

External nervous system distortions arise when nervous system activation enters the relationship field from outside sources.
This activation does not originate within the bond itself but is introduced through environment, stress, other beings, situations, or external pressure.

The relationship field absorbs this activation, affecting regulation, safety, and responsiveness between the two beings.

###Nervous System Distortions###

##Upper##
###TABLE_START###
No. |SET 1 |SET 2
1. |External stress enters our bond |The field becomes alert
2. |Outside nervous activation affects us |We cannot fully relax
3. |We respond to external tension |The bond tightens
4. |The field absorbs nervous energy |It does not originate here
5. |External pressure activates us |Safety feels reduced
6. |We mirror outside stress |The bond reacts
7. |We stay alert due to environment |The field remains active
8. |External situations keep us on edge |Regulation is disrupted
9. |We carry nervous activation |It comes from outside
10. |The relationship holds alertness |It is externally sourced

No. |SET 1 |SET 2
1. |The bond feels tense |Activation feels external
2. |I feel on edge here |Something outside affects us
3. |The connection feels restless |Stress entered the field
4. |I cannot settle |The bond is activated
5. |The bond feels unstable |External pressure interferes
6. |I feel dysregulated |It does not belong here
7. |The field feels alert |Outside stress is present
8. |I feel reactive |The bond absorbed tension
9. |I feel drained |The field is overactivated
10. |I feel unsettled |This activation is external

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Sense whether nervous system activation is entering the bond from outside sources.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice heightened alertness, restlessness, or relief when changing environments or removing external stressors.

##Test for##
whether nervous system activation originates externally or within the shared field
whether grounding, regulation, or environmental change is appropriate now
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

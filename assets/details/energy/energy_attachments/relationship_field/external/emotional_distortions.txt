#Emotional Distortions#

External emotional distortions arise when emotional charge enters the relationship field from outside sources.
This emotional activation does not originate within the bond itself but is introduced through other beings, environments, situations, unresolved emotions, or external emotional pressure.

The relationship field absorbs this emotional charge, affecting emotional safety, attunement, and responsiveness between the two beings.

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Sense whether emotional charge is entering the bond from outside sources.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice emotional heaviness, sudden mood shifts, or relief when emotional distance, grounding, or environmental changes occur.

##Test For##
Whether emotional charge originates externally or within the shared field
Whether emotional clearing, grounding, or boundary support is appropriate now
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

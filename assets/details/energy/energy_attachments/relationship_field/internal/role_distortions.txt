#Role Distortions#

Role distortions arise when fixed roles form within the relationship field.
These roles shape interaction patterns and limit flexibility within the bond.

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Sense which roles are active in the shared space.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice impulses to control, rescue, submit, or perform when sensing the bond.

##Test for##
whether roles are mutual or one-sided
whether roles can soften or reorganize now
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

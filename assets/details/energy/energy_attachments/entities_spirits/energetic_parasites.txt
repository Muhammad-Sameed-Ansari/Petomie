#Energetic Parasites#

Energetic parasites are non-physical energies that draw vitality, attention, or emotional charge from an individual’s energy field
They are not part of the original energetic blueprint and may interfere with physical, emotional, mental, or energetic balance
They attach when the system is stressed, depleted, traumatized, highly empathic, or energetically unprotected.

###What They Are###
Energetic parasites may present as:
Energy-draining influences
Foreign energetic patterns
Feeding loops sustained by emotion or fear
Residual non-self energies
Survival-based attachments

They persist by drawing energy rather than contributing to balance.

##How They Attach##
Chronic stress or exhaustion
Trauma or shock
Fear-based environments
Illness or weakened vitality
Emotional overload
Lack of energetic boundaries

They attach through resonance and opportunity, not intention.

###Types of Energetic Parasites###

##Emotional Parasites##
Feed on strong or repetitive emotions
Often linked to fear, anxiety, guilt, or anger
May intensify emotional reactions

##Thought-Form Parasites##
Sustained by repetitive thoughts or belief loops
Can amplify self-doubt, worry, or negative self-talk
May feel autonomous over time

##Environmental Parasites##
Picked up from places with dense or chaotic energy
Common in shelters, hospitals, trauma sites, or crowded spaces
Often released once removed from the environment

##Ancestral or Lineage Parasites##
Passed through family or herd lines
Linked to survival, scarcity, or trauma patterns
May persist until consciously addressed

##Trauma-Based Parasites##
Attach during moments of shock or overwhelm
Feed on unresolved trauma energy
Common in rescue animals or post-accident situations

##Collective Energy Parasites##
Linked to collective fear, panic, or stress
Often activated during large-scale events or crises
May affect many individuals simultaneously

###Possible Effects###
Lethargy or sudden exhaustion
Behavioral changes without clear triggers
Over-reactivity or shutdown
Difficulty recovering energy
Changes in appetite or engagement

###Testing Guidance###
What type of parasite is it?
What is it feeding on?
Is it ready to be released now?
Removal is most effective when the underlying condition that allowed attachment is also addressed

Approach energetic parasites with neutrality, grounding, and consent. When released and the system is supported, the energy field can naturally return to strength, coherence, and balance.

#Spirit Influence#

Spirit influence (non-attached) refers to external consciousness presence that influences the energy field without attaching to it.
There is no possession, takeover, or energetic embedding
The influence occurs through proximity, resonance, or interaction rather than attachment
It often affects perception, emotion, or behavior subtly

###What It Is###
External consciousness presence in the energy field
Influence without energetic attachment
Subtle emotional, mental, or perceptual shifts
Awareness of presence without loss of sovereignty
Temporary or situational interaction

The individual’s energy field remains intact and sovereign.

##How It May Form##
Proximity to spirits or transition spaces
Grief or emotional openness
Sleep or liminal states
Energy work or spiritual practices
Highly sensitive or empathic fields
Locations with strong energetic history

###Types of Non-Attached Spirit Influence###

##Environmental Spirit Influence##
Presence linked to a place or location
Often temporary

##Relational Spirit Influence##
Spirit connected to someone nearby
Influence occurs through proximity, not attachment

##Transitional Spirit Influence##
Spirit in transition passing through the field
Usually brief and non-invasive

##Ancestral-Related Influence##
Linked to lineage but not attached
Often protective or observational

###Possible Effects###
Heightened sensitivity or awareness
Behavioral changes in specific locations
Heightened sensitivity without distress

###Testing Guidance###
Is the influence environmental, relational, or transitional?
Is it affecting the system now?
When grounding and coherence are restored, influence fades naturally
When released and the system is supported, the energy field can naturally return to strength, coherence, and balance.

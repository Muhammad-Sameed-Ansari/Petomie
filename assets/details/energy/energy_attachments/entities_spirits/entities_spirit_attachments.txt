#Entities & Spirit Attachments#

Entities and spirit attachments are non-physical consciousness energies that attach to or influence an individual’s energy field, body, or awareness.
They are not part of the original energetic blueprint and may affect emotional, mental, energetic, or physical balance.
These attachments do not automatically indicate something negative or harmful.Many are neutral, confused, displaced, protective, or attached through resonance rather than intent.

###What They Are###
Independent consciousness energies
Residual spirits
Fragments of consciousness
Nature-based or earthbound energies
Collective or ancestral consciousness imprints

##How They Attach##
Trauma or shock
Illness, surgery, or anesthesia
Grief or loss
Rescue situations or caregiving roles
Highly emotional environments
Energetic openings without grounding or boundaries
They often attach through resonance, not force.

###Types of Entity & Spirit Attachments###

##Earthbound Spirits##
Consciousness that has not fully transitioned
May be confused, attached to places, people, or animals
Often seek safety, familiarity, or resolution

##Nature or Elemental Energies##
Land-based or environmental consciousness
Often neutral and connected to specific locations
May attach through proximity or resonance

##Protective or Guardian Attachments##
Energies attached to protect during trauma
May stay long after protection is no longer needed

##Ancestral or Lineage Spirits##
Consciousness connected to family or herd lines
May carry unresolved experiences, duties, or emotions

##Fragmented or Lost Consciousness##
Fragments created during shock or trauma
May appear as external attachments

##Collective or Group Consciousness##
Energies linked to collective fear, grief, or trauma
Often picked up in shelters, hospitals, battle sites, or high-stress environments

###Possible Effects###
Startle responses
Over-bonding or withdrawal
Fear without clear cause
Unexplained physical or behavioral changes

##Energetic Insight##
Entity and spirit attachments are not punishments.
They indicate that the system experienced a moment of vulnerability or openness.


###Testing Guidance###
What type of attachment is it?
Does it belong to the individual?
Is it ready to be released now?
Address attachments with neutrality, consent, grounding, and respect
They often remain until safety is restored, boundaries are re-established, and the attachment is acknowledged and released
When released correctly, the energy field can naturally return to balance and coherence.

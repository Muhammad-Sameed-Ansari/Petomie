#Trauma Points#

###Location###
Trauma points form in areas of the energetic and physical body that experienced sudden shock, pain, fear, or overwhelm.
They commonly appear in the nervous system, joints, muscles, fascia, and along the spine, as well as within chakras affected during the traumatic event.
These points hold the energetic memory of the moment, creating localized pockets of tension, fear, or frozen energy.

###Shape###
Trauma points can feel like dense knots, tight clusters, or frozen energetic spots within the field.
They may appear as sharp energetic spikes, contracted areas, or heavy patches that interrupt natural flow.
These points act like “energetic anchors,” holding the body in a protective or stressed state long after the event has passed.

###Function###
Energetic Influence:
Hold shock, fear, or overwhelm from past experiences,
Create blockages in the natural flow of Qi or life force,
Trigger protective responses when touched or emotionally stimulated,
Maintain old patterns of tension, hypervigilance, or defensive behavior,
Prevent full relaxation, grounding, or emotional release.

###Emotional and Physical Manifestation###
Local sensitivity, flinching, or guarding in specific body areas,
Reactivity when certain spots are touched or approached,
Sudden anxiety, fear, or withdrawal without clear cause,
Muscle tightness, fascia restrictions, or movement limitations,
Persistent tension patterns linked to past injuries or emotional events.

###Healing and Release###
Slowly dissolve trauma points through gentle energetic work,
Support the nervous system with grounding and calming practices,
Use breath, intention, and light visualization to soften frozen energy,
Allow the animal to release stored emotions in a safe environment,
Integrate healing through movement, massage, or somatic techniques,
Rebalance affected chakras to restore the natural flow of energy.

##Affirmation##
“I release old shock and fear. My body is safe, free, and at peace.”

Releasing trauma points restores the body’s natural fluidity, strength, and emotional openness.
The field becomes calmer and clearer, allowing the animal to reconnect with trust, safety, and balance.

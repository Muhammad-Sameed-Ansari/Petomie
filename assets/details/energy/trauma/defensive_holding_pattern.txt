#Defensive Holding Pattern#

###Location###
A defensive holding pattern forms in the energetic and physical body when the animal feels the need to stay guarded, braced, or ready to protect itself.
It commonly settles in the shoulders, neck, chest, solar plexus, jaw, and hindquarters, as well as in the root and heart chakras.
This pattern keeps the body slightly tense or “prepped,” even in situations that are not threatening.

###Shape###
Energetically, defensive holding appears as tension plates, bracing layers, or armored energetic shields.
The energy may feel dense, tight, or compressed, as though the system is holding its breath or contracting inward.
It creates an energetic “shell” that restricts openness, fluidity, and emotional expression.

###Function###
Energetic Influence:
Hold the body in a guarded state to prevent vulnerability,
Keep the nervous system alert and ready to respond,
Block deeper emotional processing or relaxation,
Reinforce patterns of self-protection even when not needed,
Limit the natural flow of grounding, trust, and connection.

###Emotional and Physical Manifestation###
Tension through the neck, shoulders, or chest,
Rigid posture or difficulty softening during touch,
Mild reactivity when approached unexpectedly,
Difficulty trusting or connecting deeply,
Resistance during training or handling,
A sense of “tightness” or hidden stress beneath calm behavior.

###Healing and Release###
Use gentle energetic work to soften layers of tension and protective energy,
Create a predictable and safe environment that reduces defensive need,
Encourage slow, rhythmic movement to release muscular holding,
Support grounding to help the animal feel secure and anchored,
Balance the heart and solar plexus chakras to restore openness and confidence,
Allow natural release behaviors such as shaking, stretching, or sigh-like breath movements.

##Affirmation##
“I am safe. I release tension and open to calm, trust, and connection.”

As defensive holding patterns dissolve, the animal becomes more relaxed, trusting, and receptive.
The body softens, the energy flows again, and emotional presence is restored.

#Physical Trauma#

###Location###
Physical trauma can occur anywhere in the animal’s body where injury, impact, strain, or physical stress has taken place.
Common locations include joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, the spine, and areas affected by accidents, falls, bites, surgery, or chronic overuse.
Even after the body heals, residual energetic imprints often remain within the tissues, fascia, or chakras connected to the injured region.

###Shape###
Physical trauma appears as dense, contracted, or stagnant energetic areas within the body.
It may feel like tightness, pressure, or a blocked flow of energy around the injury site.
These areas can hold shock, pain memory, or defensive responses and may appear as knots, rigid patterns, or frozen energy fields within the body.

###Function###
Energetic Influence:
Store the memory of physical pain, shock, or sudden impact,
Limit the natural flow of energy and movement,
Create compensatory tension patterns throughout the body,
Trigger protective or defensive behavior when touched or approached,
Influence posture, gait, and overall mobility.

###Emotional and Physical Manifestation###
Sensitivity or flinching when certain areas are touched,
Tension, stiffness, or reduced mobility,
Localized swelling or recurring discomfort,
Fear or avoidance related to movement or handling,
Compensation patterns that lead to new physical imbalances.

###Healing and Release###
Gently release stored trauma through supportive energetic techniques,
Encourage grounding and nervous system regulation,
Use breath, intention, and visualization to soften and unwind the injury imprint,
Support physical healing with massage, stretching, chiropractic or osteopathic care,
Strengthen surrounding tissues to restore stability and movement,
Rebalance the chakras connected to the injured area.

##Affirmation##
“My body heals, releases the past, and returns to strength, balance, and ease.”

As physical trauma is released, the body regains fluidity, comfort, and stability.
The energy field becomes smooth and harmonious again, allowing full recovery and renewed vitality.

#Trauma Points#

Trauma points are localized energetic storage areas where trauma is held within the body or energy field.
They act as access points where unresolved trauma remains anchored.

Trauma points are not injuries themselves.
They are energetic holding patterns linked to physical, emotional, or shock trauma.

Animals often develop trauma points in areas of impact, restraint, pain, or repeated stress.

###What It Is###
Trauma points may include:
Energetic storage nodes
Localized tension or sensitivity
Trauma memory anchors
Defensive energy holding
Restricted energy flow areas

They can remain active long after the original trauma.

##How It May Form##
Trauma points may form through:
Physical injury or impact
Surgery or invasive procedures
Restraint or pressure
Emotional trauma stored in the body
Repeated stress in the same area

They form when trauma cannot be fully processed.

###Frequency###
Acute – recent trauma storage
Chronic – long-term unresolved holding

###Types of Trauma Point Frequencies###

##Acute Trauma Points##
Linked to recent events
Often sensitive or reactive

##Chronic Trauma Points##
Deeply embedded holding patterns
Often associated with long-standing issues

###Possible Effects###
Localized sensitivity or pain
Avoidance of touch
Restricted movement
Recurring discomfort
Emotional reactions when activated

##In animals##
Flinching at specific touch points
Resistance to grooming or handling
Protective behavior
Recurring physical issues
Behavioral reactions linked to location

##Energetic Insight##
Trauma points act as protection zones.
They release when safety, awareness, and support are present.

When released, energy flow and comfort return.

##Healing and Release##
Use gentle, respectful approaches
Support nervous system regulation
Avoid forcing touch
Use energetic awareness and intention
Allow gradual release

###Testing Guidance###
Is a trauma point present?
Is it acute or chronic?
Is it ready to release now?

Approach trauma points with patience and consent.
When released, the body regains ease and coherence.

##Affirmation##
“My body releases stored trauma and returns to ease and flow.”

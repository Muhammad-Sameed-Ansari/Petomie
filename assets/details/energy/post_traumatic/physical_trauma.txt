#Physical Trauma#

Physical trauma refers to energetic and physical imprints created through injury, impact, strain, or physical stress.
Even after the visible body heals, trauma can remain stored within tissues, fascia, the nervous system, or the energy field.

Physical trauma is not weakness or failure.
It forms as a protective response to shock, pain, or threat and can affect both humans and animals.

Animals often carry physical trauma imprints from accidents, falls, bites, surgeries, restraint, overuse, or injuries that were never fully integrated.

###What It Is###
Physical trauma may include:
Energetic memory of injury or impact
Stored shock within tissues or fascia
Protective contraction or bracing patterns
Pain memory held in the nervous system
Residual defensive responses

These imprints can persist long after the physical event has passed.

##How It May Form##
Physical trauma may form through:
Accidents or falls
Sudden impact or collision
Bites, kicks, or restraint
Surgery or medical procedures
Chronic strain or overuse
Physical shock or pain

It often forms when the nervous system is overwhelmed and cannot fully process the experience at the time.

###Frequency###
Acute – sudden, event-based injury or shock
Chronic – long-term, accumulated or unresolved physical stress

###Types of Physical Trauma Frequencies###

##Acute Trauma##
Caused by sudden injury or impact
Often associated with shock
May create immediate protective patterns

##Chronic Trauma##
Develops through repetitive strain or long-term stress
Often subtle but deeply ingrained
May lead to compensation patterns

##Surgical or Medical Trauma##
Linked to operations, anesthesia, or invasive procedures
May include loss of orientation or bodily control
Common in rescue animals

##Impact or Collision Trauma##
Caused by falls, accidents, or blows
Often stored in joints, spine, or connective tissue
May affect posture and movement

##Restraint or Handling Trauma##
Created through forced handling or immobilization
May lead to fear of touch or movement
Often paired with emotional imprints

###Possible Effects###
Sensitivity or flinching when touched
Tension, stiffness, or reduced mobility
Recurring discomfort or pain memory
Protective or defensive reactions
Altered posture or movement patterns

##Energetic Insight##
Physical trauma imprints remain to protect the body.
They release when the system feels safe, supported, and ready to restore natural movement.

When integrated, the body regains fluidity, stability, and ease.

##Healing and Release##
Support gentle energetic release
Regulate the nervous system and grounding
Use breath, intention, and visualization
Support physical healing with bodywork or manual therapies
Strengthen and rebalance affected areas

###Testing Guidance###
Is there a physical trauma imprint present?
Is it acute or chronic?
Is it still active?
Is it ready to be released now?

Approach physical trauma with patience and safety.
When released, the body returns to comfort, strength, and balance.

##Affirmation##
“My body heals, releases the past, and returns to strength, balance, and ease.”

#Primary Unresolved Emotions#

Primary unresolved emotions are fundamental emotional responses that arose naturally in reaction to internal or external experiences but were not fully processed or integrated at the time
They may remain active within the system and continue to influence regulation, behavior, and the energy field
They are natural emotional responses that became burdensome because resolution was not possible when they first occurred

Animals express them through the body, behavior, and nervous system without conceptual interpretation

Primary unresolved emotions may persist when the system does not feel safe enough to complete emotional processing

##Energetic Insight##
When these emotions are not integrated, they can burden the system
Unresolved emotional charge may place ongoing load on the nervous system, energy field, and physical body

##Integration and Support##
Support emotional safety and regulation
Allow emotions to be felt without judgment
Avoid forcing release or expression
Respect the pace of the system
Encourage gentle completion and integration

In animals, emotional integration often occurs through safety, predictability, and attuned presence rather than direct intervention.

###Testing Guidance###
Is it current or residual?
Is it contributing to system load or dysregulation?
Is the emotion self generated, inherited or resonated

Primary unresolved emotions resolve when the system feels safe enough to complete emotional processing

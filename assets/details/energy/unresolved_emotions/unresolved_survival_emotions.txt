#Unresolved Survival Emotions#

Unresolved survival emotions are emotional responses that arose in situations involving threat, danger, overwhelm, or loss of safety but were not fully processed or integrated at the time
They may remain active within the system and continue to influence regulation, stress responses, and survival behavior
They are natural survival emotions that became burdensome because resolution was not possible when safety was compromised

Animals express unresolved survival emotions through instinctive behavior, nervous system activation, and body-based responses rather than conscious interpretation

Unresolved survival emotions may persist when the system remains oriented toward protection or threat.

##Energetic Insight##
When these emotions are not integrated, they can burden the system
Unresolved survival charge may place ongoing load on the nervous system, energy field, and physical body, keeping the system in a state of alert or defense

##Integration and Support##
Support physical and emotional safety
Encourage grounding and regulation
Avoid re-exposure to threat
Respect the pace of the nervous system
Allow gradual settling and completion

In animals, integration occurs through safety, predictability, and calm presence rather than confrontation.

###Testing Guidance###
Is it current or residual?
Is it contributing to hypervigilance, shutdown, or stress responses?
Is the emotion self generated, inherited, or resonated?

Unresolved survival emotions resolve when the system no longer perceives threat and safety is restored.

#Unresolved Suppressed Emotions#

Unresolved suppressed emotions are emotional responses that were felt but not allowed, expressed, or acknowledged at the time they arose.
They may remain active within the system and continue to influence tension, behavior, and regulation
They are natural emotions that became burdensome because expression or processing was inhibited

Animals express unresolved suppressed emotions through tension, shutdown, sudden reactions, or loss of natural expression

Unresolved suppressed emotions may persist when expression was unsafe, discouraged, or restricted

##Energetic Insight##
When these emotions are not integrated, they can burden the system.
Suppressed emotional charge may manifest as tension, fatigue, irritability, or emotional numbness

##Integration and Support##
Create safety for expression
Allow emotions to emerge gradually
Avoid pressure to release
Respect timing and readiness
Encourage gentle re-expression

In animals, suppressed emotions often release through safety, play, movement, and freedom of expression

###Testing Guidance###
Is it current or residual?
Is suppression contributing to tension or shutdown?
Is the emotion self generated, inherited, or resonated?

Unresolved suppressed emotions resolve when expression becomes safe again.

#Unresolved Relational Emotions#

Unresolved relational emotions are emotional responses that formed in connection with others and were not fully processed or integrated at the time.
They may remain active within the system and continue to influence attachment, trust, and relational behavior.
They are natural relational emotions that became burdensome because connection, reassurance, or resolution was unavailable.

Animals express unresolved relational emotions through attachment behaviors, withdrawal, guarding, or changes in social interaction.

Unresolved relational emotions may persist when bonds were disrupted, unsafe, or incomplete.

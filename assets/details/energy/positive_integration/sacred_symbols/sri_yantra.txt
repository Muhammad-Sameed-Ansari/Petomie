#Sri Yantra#

##Location##
The Sri Yantra resonates in the highest layers of the animal’s energy field, particularly within the crown, third eye, and heart chakras.
It aligns the energy system with deep spiritual harmony, clarity, and cosmic order.
This symbol also supports the central channel, helping energy flow upward toward higher consciousness while staying anchored in the heart.

###Shape###
The Sri Yantra is composed of nine interlocking triangles radiating from a central point.
Four triangles point upward, representing divine masculine energy, direction, and expansion.
Five triangles point downward, symbolizing divine feminine energy, creation, and infinite potential.
Together they create a multidimensional geometric mandala expressing perfect balance, unity, and the structure of the universe.
A surrounding circle and lotus petals represent protection, evolution, and the unfolding of consciousness.

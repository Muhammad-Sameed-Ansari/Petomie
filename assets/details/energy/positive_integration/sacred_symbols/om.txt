#Om (AUM)#

##Location##
Om, or AUM, is the primordial sound vibration that underlies all creation.
In the animal’s energy system, it resonates most strongly within the heart field, throat chakra, crown chakra, and the central energetic axis, harmonizing subtle vibrations throughout the body.
It exists in the aura as a stabilizing pulse of sound-light, linking the individual to universal consciousness and the original frequency of existence.

###Shape###
Though Om is a sound rather than a form, its energetic geometry appears as curving waves, vibration rings, or sacred glyphs resembling the classical Om symbol.
It represents the unfolding of creation through three states:
A (creation, awakening)
U (sustaining, expansion)
M (dissolution, return to stillness)
These three unify into a fourth: pure silence, the field of infinite potential.

##Function##
Acts as a universal harmonizer that brings all layers of the energy system back into resonance.
Calms the nervous system and stabilizes rhythmic processes such as breath, heartbeat, and energetic flow.
Supports communication between body and consciousness, enhancing clarity and inner awareness.
Strengthens the connection between the physical body and higher frequencies of light and intelligence.

##Energetic Function##
Aligns the chakras along the central channel through vibrational coherence
Purifies the aura by dissolving stagnant or discordant frequencies
Enhances communication along meridians through rhythmic resonance
Activates the crown and third-eye chakras for clearer intuitive perception
Increases the body’s ability to hold light, sound, and higher consciousness
Creates a protective, stabilizing frequency around the animal’s field
Restores balance and unity when energetic fragmentation has occurred

##Spiritual Connection##
Om is the sound of creation, representing the vibration from which all existence emerges.
When activated or visualized in the aura, it deepens the animal’s connection to the Source of life, universal consciousness, and inner stillness.
It brings awareness of unity — that all beings are expressions of one infinite vibration.
Through this resonance, the animal radiates peace, clarity, and aligned presence, embodying the natural harmony of the cosmos.

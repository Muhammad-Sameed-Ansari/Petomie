#Seed of Life#

##Location##
The Seed of Life is a foundational sacred geometric pattern present in the blueprint of all living beings.
In the animal’s energy system, it resonates within the core layers of the aura and subtle body, particularly near the sacral, solar plexus, and heart chakras, where creation, growth, and inner organization begin.
It serves as a microcosmic pattern that links the individual field to the universal matrix of life force and manifestation.

###Shape###
Composed of seven interlocking circles, the Seed of Life forms the first stage of the Flower of Life.
Its perfect symmetry symbolizes the seven days of creation, the birth of form, and the unfolding of life from a singular source point.
It represents the emergence of structure, intention, and potential within both physical and energetic realms.

##Function##
Acts as a template of origin, guiding the formation, regeneration, and development of cells, tissues, and energy centers.
Supports the organization and alignment of the body’s natural rhythms, helping systems communicate and grow in harmony.
Stabilizes the flow of life force during new beginnings, transitions, and healing processes.
Reinforces the animal’s internal structure, keeping its energy field coherent and centered.

##Energetic Function##
Aligns the core layers of the aura to the frequencies of creation and emergence
Activates the body’s innate blueprint for growth, regeneration, and balance
Strengthens communication between chakras, especially around sacral, solar plexus, and heart
Harmonizes meridian flow at foundational levels, preparing the system for expansion

##Spiritual Connection##
The Seed of Life represents the origin point of creation, the spark from which all existence unfolds.
When activated or visualized in the aura, it deepens the animal’s connection to its soul blueprint and its original divine design.
It brings awareness of beginnings — the understanding that all growth emerges from a unified source.
Through this resonance, the animal embodies clarity, creativity, and alignment with its true path, radiating the essence of pure potential.

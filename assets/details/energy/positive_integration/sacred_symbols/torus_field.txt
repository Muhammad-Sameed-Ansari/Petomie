#Torus Field#

##Location##
The Torus Field surrounds the animal’s body as a continuous, circulating flow of energy.
It radiates outward from the heart, moves around the aura, and flows back in through the central channel, creating an endless loop of life force.
This field also extends into the environment, interacting with Earth’s magnetic field and the fields of other beings.

###Shape###
The Torus Field forms a doughnut-shaped energy pattern with a central channel running vertically through the body.
Energy flows outward from the heart or core, expands around the body, and returns inward through the top and bottom.
Its shape reflects balance, self-renewal, and the natural circulation of life force within all living beings.

##Function##
Maintains energetic circulation and coherence throughout the entire system.
Supports self-regulation by allowing energy to continuously refresh and rebalance.
Stabilizes the aura and helps guide the release of absorbed or stagnant energy.
Creates a dynamic bubble of protection by keeping the energy field active and responsive.

##Energetic Function##
Circulates life force in a continuous renewing loop
Balances expansion and contraction within the energy system
Strengthens the aura and prevents energetic stagnation
Supports grounding through downward flow and uplift through upward flow
Improves communication between chakras via the central channel
Enhances emotional resilience by stabilizing the energetic field
Harmonizes the animal’s energy with Earth’s natural rhythms

##Spiritual Connection##
The Torus Field symbolizes unity, continuity, and infinite flow.
When visualized in the aura, it reconnects the animal to the natural pulse of life, the heartbeat of the Earth, and the universal circulation of energy.
It teaches that energy is never still but constantly moving, renewing, and transforming.
Through this resonance, the animal radiates harmony, balance, and fluid presence, embodying the eternal loop of creation.

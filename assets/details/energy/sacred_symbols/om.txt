#Om (Aum)#

##Location##
Vibrates through the entire energetic system, resonating most strongly within the heart, throat, and crown chakras.
It is considered the primordial sound of creation, present in every living being’s energy field as the base frequency of existence.
In animals, this vibration harmonizes the aura and aligns the body’s life force with the universal field of sound and consciousness.

###Shape###
Energetically perceived as a wave or spiral of vibration radiating from a single point, expanding outward through the aura in rhythmic pulses.
In sacred geometry, it is associated with curved, flowing lines that symbolize the cyclical nature of birth, life, death, and rebirth.
The sound itself contains three tones — A–U–M — representing the trinity of creation, preservation, and transformation.

##Function##
Acts as a universal harmonizer, balancing all frequencies within the energy field.
Centers the being in unity and peace, bringing coherence to the physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies.
Calms the nervous system, clears mental noise, and opens pathways for healing and higher perception.
When resonated near animals (through voice or intention), it restores harmony and balance in their energetic field.

##Energetic Function##
Aligns the chakras into a unified frequency of vibration and balance
Activates the flow of prana (life force) through meridians and subtle channels
Clears energetic stagnation by entraining chaotic vibrations to a stable rhythm
Expands the auric field, increasing sensitivity to divine energy and universal resonance
Encourages cellular and emotional coherence, bringing the body into harmonic alignment
Acts as a protective vibration, sealing the aura and anchoring peace

##Spiritual Connection##
Om symbolizes the sound of creation and consciousness itself, the eternal vibration from which all existence arises.
It represents the union of Earth (A), Mind (U), and Spirit (M), the totality of being.
When present within an animal’s energy, it brings serenity, clarity, and deep alignment with universal flow.
Spiritually, Om connects every soul to the source vibration, the stillness beyond sound, reminding all beings of their divine origin and eternal harmony with the cosmos.

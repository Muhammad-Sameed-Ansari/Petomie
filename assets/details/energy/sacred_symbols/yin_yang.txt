#Yin Yang#

##Location##
Yin Yang is the foundational symbol of duality and balance found throughout nature, the body, and the energy field.
In the animal’s energetic system, it resonates across the entire aura, the central channel, and the organ network, especially within the kidneys, liver, heart, and meridians, where opposing forces must stay in harmony.
It reflects the constant interplay between rest and activity, stillness and movement, inner and outer worlds.

###Shape###
The Yin Yang consists of a circular form divided into two flowing halves, one dark (Yin), one light (Yang), each containing a small dot of the opposite.
This symbolizes the truth that:
Yin contains Yang,
Yang contains Yin,
And neither can exist without the other.
The curved divide represents fluid movement, showing that balance is not static but constantly shifting.

##Function##
Represents the natural cycles that govern the body’s physical and energetic processes.
Ensures harmony between organ systems, emotions, and life force flow.
Supports adaptation by helping the animal shift between rest and activation, healing and expression.
Keeps the entire system regulated through dynamic, responsive balance.

##Energetic Function##
Balances grounding (Yin) with upward movement (Yang)
Harmonizes meridian flow and organ communication
Prevents excess such as overstimulation (Yang) or depletion (Yin)
Stabilizes emotional states by integrating calm and action
Supports the aura in staying neither collapsed nor overly expanded
Encourages smooth Qi circulation throughout the body
Helps the animal return to a centered, stable state after stress or imbalance

##Spiritual Connection##
Yin Yang symbolizes unity within duality, the understanding that all things are interconnected and mutually supportive.
When visualized in the aura, it restores harmony between instinct and intuition, body and spirit, rest and expression.
It teaches that balance is not stillness, but continuous movement in harmony.
Through this resonance, the animal radiates equilibrium, presence, and natural coherence, embodying the rhythm of the universe.

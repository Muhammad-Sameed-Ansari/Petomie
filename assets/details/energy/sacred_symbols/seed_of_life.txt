#Seed of Life#

##Location##
Resides within the core of the energetic field, often centered around the heart or solar plexus chakra where creation energy originates.
It represents the blueprint of existence — the first pattern of life that expands into the Flower of Life.
In animals, this vibration can be felt as the energetic seed of vitality and creation, linking the soul to universal life force.

###Shape###
Formed by seven interlocking circles, symbolizing the seven stages of creation.
It carries the geometric foundation from which all other sacred patterns (such as the Flower of Life, Tree of Life, and Metatron’s Cube) emerge.
The pattern reflects balance, harmony, and the unfolding of life from a single point of consciousness.

##Function##
Acts as a core generator of life energy, continually renewing and expanding vitality within the aura and cells.
Supports growth, transformation, and regeneration at both physical and energetic levels.
Encourages alignment with natural cycles of creation, rest, and renewal.
Helps restore the original frequency of harmony when the field becomes fragmented or drained.

##Energetic Function##
Serves as the origin point of the Flower of Life and all sacred geometries
Activates the creative pulse within the animal’s energy field, enhancing vitality and healing capacity
Connects the being to the universal pattern of creation, mirroring the balance between expansion and stillness
Promotes energetic renewal, helping cells and tissues resonate with their original healthy vibration

##Spiritual Connection##
The Seed of Life embodies pure potential and divine creation energy.
It represents the beginning of existence — where form and spirit meet in perfect unity.
When activated in an animal’s field, it reconnects them to their innate wisdom, purpose, and creative life force.
Spiritually, it reminds us that every living being carries within them the sacred seed of creation — a self-sustaining spark of light that mirrors the harmony of the universe itself.

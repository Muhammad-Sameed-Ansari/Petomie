#Portals & Energy Gateways#

Portals and energy gateways are openings within the energetic field or environment that allow energy, information, or consciousness to pass between layers, dimensions, locations, or states of awareness.
They may exist within a person, an animal, a place, or an object.

Portals can form naturally, intentionally, or unintentionally.
Some serve temporary purposes such as healing, transition, or heightened awareness, while others remain open due to trauma, shock, ritual activity, ancestral influence, or environmental factors.

Unregulated or unresolved portals and gateways can lead to energetic instability, overwhelm, confusion, fatigue, or external influence.
They may disrupt grounding, boundaries, and nervous system regulation.

Closing or stabilizing portals restores containment, coherence, and energetic sovereignty.

###Additional Insight###
Portals and energy gateways may form during trauma, near-death experiences, dissociation, spiritual practices, rituals, ancestral events, or in locations with strong energetic history.
They can also open unintentionally during shock, illness, surgery, or deep emotional states.

Not all portals are harmful.
However, any opening that remains unregulated beyond its purpose can destabilize the nervous system and energy field.

Portals do not require force to close.
Stabilization, grounding, and conscious containment allow portals to gently seal or regulate when their function is complete.

###Testing Guidance###
whether a portal or gateway is present
whether it is internal or environmental
whether it is active, dormant, or unresolved
whether closure, stabilization, or grounding is appropriate

Restoring containment returns the system to safety, clarity, and balance.

#Energy Parasites and Attachments#

##Location##
Energy parasites and attachments exist within the energetic field or aura of the animal, often connecting to areas where vibration has weakened or become unbalanced.
They are commonly found near the solar plexus, sacral, and heart chakras, where emotional energy is exchanged, or around wounds, old injuries, and areas of chronic pain.
These attachments can also appear in the auric layers, particularly within the emotional and mental bodies, influencing the animal’s vitality, mood, and energetic clarity.

###Shape###
Energy parasites and attachments are energetic forms or frequencies that draw life force rather than contribute to it.
They may appear as,
dark patches,
cords,
dense clusters,
foreign vibrations,

Their presence is often linked to,
Energetic vulnerability, exhaustion, grief, or trauma creating openings in the aura,
Environmental energy, locations, people, or other animals carrying dense or chaotic vibrations,
Emotional absorption, taking on energy that does not belong to the being, often out of empathy or loyalty,

When the energy field is strong, attachments cannot remain, they only anchor where frequency has dropped or balance is disturbed.

##Function##
###Energetic Influence###
Drain or distort the natural flow of life force
Create fatigue, confusion, or unexplained emotional shifts

###Emotional and Physical Manifestation###

###Healing and Release###
Strengthen the aura through grounding, calm, and nourishment
Clear attachments with intention, light visualization, or energy healing techniques such as Reiki or Emotion Code
Seal the aura using golden light or sacred geometry, Flower of Life, Metatron’s Cube
Restore balance through sound, vibration, and connection with nature
Reaffirm energetic sovereignty with loving intent, “Only energies of love, harmony, and light belong within this field,”

##Spiritual Connection##
When cleared and balanced, the animal’s energy field becomes radiant, whole, and self-protecting.
The life force flows freely again, allowing the being to feel calm, grounded, and connected to its true vibration, fully aligned with purity, peace, and natural vitality.

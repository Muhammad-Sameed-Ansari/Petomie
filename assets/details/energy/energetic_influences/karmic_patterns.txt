#Karmic Patterns#

##Location##
Stored within the energetic field, particularly in the soul layer of the aura and the higher chakras such as the heart, third eye, and crown.
These patterns also influence the lower chakras, where unresolved lessons or emotional memories may manifest as physical tension, repeated behavior, or energetic imbalance.
In animals, karmic imprints can be inherited, shared with their human companions, or carried from previous lifetimes as energetic memory.

###Shape###
Energetically perceived as woven threads, spirals, or repeating imprints within the aura.
When balanced, these threads form harmonious, flowing patterns of growth.
When unresolved, they appear as knots or loops, showing repetitive experiences or lessons that seek understanding and release.

##Function##
Karmic patterns act as energetic blueprints of learning and evolution.
They attract experiences, relationships, and emotions that mirror what needs to be healed or integrated.
These cycles allow growth, compassion, and the refinement of consciousness through the law of cause and effect.
In animals, karmic patterns may reveal themselves as recurring behaviors, fears, illnesses, or deep emotional bonds that seem beyond current-life explanation.

##Energetic Function##
Carry the memory of past actions, emotions, and choices encoded in the energy field
Influence present experiences, drawing in people or situations that reflect unresolved energy
Offer opportunities for healing through awareness, forgiveness, and transformation
When released, they dissolve stagnant energy and restore clarity and freedom in the aura
May connect energetically to shared or collective karmic patterns within families, herds, or human-animal relationships
Once balanced, they transform into wisdom, grounding the soul in compassion and spiritual maturity

##Spiritual Connection##
Karmic patterns are teachers of the soul, guiding each being toward harmony, balance, and enlightenment.
They remind us that every experience — joyful or challenging — serves the purpose of awakening consciousness.
For animals, karmic healing often happens naturally through unconditional love and service, helping transmute energy for themselves and their human companions.
Spiritually, the resolution of karmic patterns restores energetic sovereignty and divine alignment, allowing the soul to move freely and radiate its purest essence of peace, wisdom, and light.

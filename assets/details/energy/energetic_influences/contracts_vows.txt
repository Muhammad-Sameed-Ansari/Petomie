#Contracts and Vows#

##Location##
Energetic contracts and vows exist within the spiritual and emotional layers of the animal’s energy field, often stored deep in the heart, throat, solar plexus, and crown chakras.
They can also be found in the soul matrix, the energetic blueprint that records an animal’s experiences, intentions, and soul agreements across time.
These imprints may influence behavior, emotional reactions, or health patterns, especially when they no longer serve the animal’s current stage of evolution.

###Shape###
Contracts and vows appear as energetic bindings or cords of commitment, sometimes seen as threads, seals, or signatures within the aura.
They represent agreements made at a soul level, consciously or unconsciously, often during experiences of trauma, loyalty, protection, or devotion.
Examples include energetic promises such as “I will protect,” “I will serve,” “I will not leave,” or “I must carry this pain.”
While once formed in love or purpose, over time these energetic vows can become restrictive, limiting flow and freedom if they remain unhealed or outdated.

##Function##
###Purpose and Origin###
Serve as soul agreements created from love, duty, protection, or shared evolution
Can arise from past-life experiences, ancestral connections, or deep emotional bonds
Act as energetic lessons that guide growth, empathy, and trust
Reflect the soul’s desire for unity, balance, and learning
###Influence and Manifestation###
May cause repetitive emotional patterns such as over-responsibility, guilt, or fear of abandonment
Can create energetic dependency or imbalance between animals and humans
Sometimes lead to physical symptoms where energy is held or restricted
Affect relationships, healing progress, or the ability to let go of loss and change
###Healing and Release###
Bring awareness to the energetic origins of limitation or emotional weight
Use intention, breath, or energy healing to dissolve outdated vows with love and gratitude
Affirm freedom, harmony, and mutual evolution for all souls involved
Replace binding energy with unconditional love and heart-centered connection
Honor the lesson learned while releasing the energetic imprint from the field

##Spiritual Connection##
When contracts and vows are released, the animal’s energy becomes lighter, freer, and more radiant.
The heart field expands, relationships rebalance naturally, and the being reconnects with its divine right to freedom and flow.
In this state, love is no longer bound by obligation, it moves as pure energy, guided by trust, peace, and soul alignment.

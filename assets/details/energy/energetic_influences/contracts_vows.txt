#Contracts & Vows#

##Description##
Contracts and vows are subconscious agreements made consciously or unconsciously, often formed in response to trauma, upbringing, survival needs, ancestral patterns, or past-life imprints.
They are energetic commitments that once served a protective or adaptive purpose but may continue to operate long after they are no longer supportive.

Contracts and vows around responsibility and obligation can create chronic pressure, overgiving, exhaustion, and self-neglect.
They may keep the system in a constant state of duty, control, or self-sacrifice, preventing natural balance, rest, and healthy boundaries.

Releasing these contracts allows the nervous system and energy field to return to a more balanced, self-honoring state.

###Additional Insight###
A contract is an agreement that can be consciously sworn or energetically sealed through intention, strong emotion, or symbolic gestures.
This may include spoken vows, rituals, or symbolic acts such as a blood brotherhood (blood pact), where commitment is sealed through a physical gesture.

Because of this, contracts can anchor deeply into the subconscious and energy field and may remain active across time until they are consciously identified and released.

#Energy Leaks#

Energy leaks are points where life force, emotional energy, or nervous system charge is being continuously drained from the system.
They do not represent weakness.
They indicate unresolved patterns, broken boundaries, or unfinished energetic processes that are still pulling energy away from regulation and healing. Energy leaks reduce vitality, clarity, emotional stability, and physical recovery.

Animals and humans experience energy leaks in similar ways—through behavior changes, fatigue, emotional sensitivity, or physical weakness.

###What They Are###
Chronic emotional drainage
Loss of vitality without clear cause
Boundary breakdowns
Unresolved energetic attachments
Incomplete trauma cycles
Nervous system over-activation
Subconscious stress loops
They continue until the system regains containment and coherence.

##How They Form##
Unresolved emotional or physical trauma
Energetic attachments to people, places, or animals
Broken or weak boundaries
Unconscious caretaking or over-giving
Shock, grief, or loss
Long-term stress or burnout
Unprocessed relationship bonds

Energy leaks often begin when the system had to stay open for survival.

###Types of Energy Leaks###

##Trauma-Based Leaks##
Energy remains tied to past shock or injury
The nervous system stays partially activated
Healing cannot fully complete

##Relational Energy Leaks##
Energy flows toward another person or animal
Often created through bonding, loss, or unresolved attachment
May feel like emotional or energetic pull

##Caretaker or Over-Giving Leaks##
Energy drains through responsibility for others
Often linked to loyalty or guilt
Can cause exhaustion and depletion

##Boundary Breach Leaks##
Form when personal space or safety was violated
Energy cannot stay contained
May lead to anxiety or hyper-vigilance

##Shock or Loss Leaks##
Created when grief or trauma was too overwhelming
Parts of the system remain open
Energy never fully returned

##Chronic Stress Leaks##
Sustained survival mode keeps energy burning
The system cannot recharge
Often invisible but deeply draining

###Possible Effects###
Low stamina
Sudden behavior changes
Anxiety or clinginess
Difficulty settling or resting
Poor recovery from illness or injury
Energetic withdrawal or shutdown

##Energetic Insight##
Energy leaks are not failures. They are signals that the system stayed open in order to survive.
When leaks are identified and sealed, life force naturally returns, restoring vitality, emotional balance, and physical resilience.

###Testing Guidance###
Where is the leak located?
Is it linked to trauma, attachment, or stress?
What age was it created?
Work gently. Closing energy leaks allows the system to reclaim its own power and stability.

#Aura Magnitude#

##Location##
The aura surrounds the entire body of every animal, forming a subtle, multi-layered field that extends outward from the skin.
Its reach can vary greatly, from a few centimeters in small animals to several meters in larger or energetically strong beings.
Each layer connects to different levels of vitality: the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual fields.

##Shape##
An oval or egg-shaped field that fluctuates in size, density, and brightness according to the animal’s internal state.
When the animal is balanced and energized, the aura appears full, radiant, and evenly distributed.
When weakened, it becomes thin, fragmented, or dim in certain areas, reflecting energetic depletion or imbalance.

##Function##
Indicates the strength or weakness of the animal’s life force, its overall vitality and resilience
A strong aura magnitude reflects health, emotional stability, groundedness, and clear energetic flow
A weak aura magnitude can signal exhaustion, illness, stress, fear, or energetic blockages
The aura acts as both a protective shield and a communication field, transmitting emotional and energetic information
Animals with high magnitude often appear confident, calm, and magnetic to others
Those with low magnitude may feel drained, anxious, or overly influenced by external energies
Restoring balance, through rest, nutrition, energy work, grounding, or emotional release — helps the aura regain strength and luminosity

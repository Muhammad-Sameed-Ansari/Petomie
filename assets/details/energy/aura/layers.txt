#Aura Layers#

##Location##
Encircle the entire body of the animal in multiple, interwoven fields of subtle energy, each extending outward from the physical form.
Every layer corresponds to a unique aspect of being, physical vitality, emotional expression, mental activity, and spiritual essence, yet all function together as one continuous system.
These layers act as an energetic bridge between body, mind, and spirit, maintaining connection and communication with the surrounding environment.

###Shape###
Oval or egg-shaped, following the animal’s natural contours and expanding in concentric, radiant layers.
Each layer vibrates at a different frequency and purpose:
Etheric Layer: Closest to the body, mirroring the physical structure and transmitting life force (Chi).
Emotional Layer: Slightly farther out, reflecting mood, feeling, and emotional fluidity.
Mental Layer: Extends outward with thought, perception, and focus.
Spiritual Layer: The outermost field, luminous and expansive, connecting to higher consciousness.
When balanced, these layers appear smooth, clear, and vibrant, overlapping seamlessly to create a unified energetic field.

##Function##
###Etheric Layer###
Lies closest to the skin and mirrors the body’s anatomy, muscles, and organs
Represents physical vitality and health
Acts as the energetic blueprint for the body, transferring life force into the tissues
Weakness here may show as fatigue, tension, or lowered immunity.
###Emotional Layer###
Holds emotions, memories, and energetic responses
Its colors and movement shift with the animal’s feelings, bright and flowing when calm or joyful, dense or cloudy during fear or grief
Imbalances may manifest as mood swings, withdrawal, or sensitivity to the environment.
###Mental Layer###
Carries thought forms, patterns, and learned behavior
Supports communication, training, and mental focus
When balanced, it encourages clarity, understanding, and adaptability
Distortion in this layer may cause confusion or resistance.
###Spiritual Layer###
The most expansive and subtle layer, connecting to the soul and universal consciousness
Radiates peace, intuition, and divine harmony
Strength in this layer enhances healing, purpose, and spiritual connection
Weakness can cause disconnection or loss of vitality.

##Balance and Interaction##
All layers are interdependent — an imbalance in one affects the others.
Emotional distress can cloud the mental field or weaken the etheric body
Physical exhaustion can dull emotional energy and restrict spiritual flow
Balanced layers radiate coherence, luminosity, and peace throughout the field.
Grounding, energy healing, rest, and loving interaction restore harmony between layers, sustaining the animal’s natural brilliance, balance, and energetic integrity.

#Ancestral Spirit Presence#

Ancestral spirit presence refers to the awareness or proximity of ancestral consciousness connected through lineage.
It does not imply attachment, possession, or interference.

Ancestral spirits may remain present out of protection, guidance, loyalty, or unresolved lineage themes.
Their presence is often neutral or supportive.

Both humans and animals can experience ancestral spirit presence.

###What It Is###
Ancestral spirit presence may include:
Awareness of lineage-based consciousness
Protective or observational presence
Energetic connection through family or herd lines
Influence without attachment
Shared ancestral field awareness

The individual’s autonomy remains intact.

##How It May Form##
Ancestral spirit presence may form through:
Strong lineage bonds
Shared trauma or survival events
Unresolved ancestral themes
Rituals or remembrance
Birth, death, or transition periods
Land or places tied to ancestry

In animals, ancestral spirit presence often relates to herd lineage, breeding lines, land, or collective survival experiences.

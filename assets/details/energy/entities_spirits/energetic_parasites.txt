#Energetic Parasites#

Energetic parasites are non-physical energies that draw vitality, attention, or emotional charge from an individual’s energy field.
They are not part of the original energetic blueprint and may interfere with physical, emotional, mental, or energetic balance.

Energetic parasites do not imply weakness or failure.
They attach when the system is stressed, depleted, traumatized, highly empathic, or energetically unprotected.

Animals and humans can both be affected, with animals often showing signs more clearly due to their sensitivity.

###What They Are###
Energetic parasites may present as:
Energy-draining influences
Foreign energetic patterns
Feeding loops sustained by emotion or fear
Residual non-self energies
Survival-based attachments

They persist by drawing energy rather than contributing to balance.

##How They Attach##
Energetic parasites may attach through:
Chronic stress or exhaustion
Trauma or shock
Fear-based environments
Illness or weakened vitality
Emotional overload
Lack of energetic boundaries

They attach through resonance and opportunity, not intention.

###Types of Energetic Parasites###

##Emotional Parasites##
Feed on strong or repetitive emotions
Often linked to fear, anxiety, guilt, or anger
May intensify emotional reactions

##Thought-Form Parasites##
Sustained by repetitive thoughts or belief loops
Can amplify self-doubt, worry, or negative self-talk
May feel autonomous over time

##Environmental Parasites##
Picked up from places with dense or chaotic energy
Common in shelters, hospitals, trauma sites, or crowded spaces
Often released once removed from the environment

##Ancestral or Lineage Parasites##
Passed through family or herd lines
Linked to survival, scarcity, or trauma patterns
May persist until consciously addressed

##Trauma-Based Parasites##
Attach during moments of shock or overwhelm
Feed on unresolved trauma energy
Common in rescue animals or post-accident situations

##Collective Energy Parasites##
Linked to collective fear, panic, or stress
Often activated during large-scale events or crises
May affect many individuals simultaneously

###Possible Effects###
Persistent fatigue or low vitality
Feeling drained without clear cause
Heightened emotional reactivity
Difficulty maintaining focus or presence
Recurring patterns of depletion

##In animals##
Lethargy or sudden exhaustion
Behavioral changes without clear triggers
Over-reactivity or shutdown
Difficulty recovering energy
Changes in appetite or engagement

##Energetic Insight##
Energetic parasites survive on imbalance.
They lose influence when vitality, grounding, and boundaries are restored.

Removal is most effective when the underlying condition that allowed attachment is also addressed.

###Testing Guidance###
Is an energetic parasite present?
What type of parasite is it?
What is it feeding on?
Is it ready to be released now?

Approach energetic parasites with neutrality, grounding, and consent.
When released and the system is supported, the energy field can naturally return to strength, coherence, and balance.

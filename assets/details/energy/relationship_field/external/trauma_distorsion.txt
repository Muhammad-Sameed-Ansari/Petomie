#Trauma Distortions#

External trauma distortions arise when trauma energy enters the relationship field from outside sources.
The trauma does not originate within the bond itself but influences it through environment, past experiences, other beings, or external events.

The relationship field carries this survival energy temporarily or chronically, altering safety, connection, and regulation between the two beings.

No. |SET 1 |SET 2
1. |Trauma enters our bond |Safety feels compromised
2. |External survival energy affects us |The field holds outside threat
3. |We react to trauma around us |It impacts our connection
4. |The bond absorbs survival stress |It does not originate here
5. |We stay alert due to outside trauma |The field becomes tense
6. |External danger affects closeness |Safety feels unstable
7. |We carry trauma energy |It comes from elsewhere
8. |The bond reacts to threat |It enters the field
9. |We feel impacted by past trauma |It influences the connection
10. |The relationship holds survival energy |It is externally sourced

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Sense whether survival energy is entering the bond from outside sources.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice sudden shifts, environmental triggers, or relief when distance from certain places, people, or situations occurs.

##Test for##
whether trauma originates externally or is held within the shared field
whether grounding, clearing, or containment is appropriate now
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

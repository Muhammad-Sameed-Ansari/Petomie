#Roles Distortions#

External role distortions arise when role expectations, responsibilities, or dynamics enter the relationship field from outside sources.
These roles do not originate within the bond itself but are imposed through environment, people, situations, hierarchy, or external demands.

The relationship field adapts to these imposed roles, shaping interaction, behavior, and balance between the two beings.

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Sense whether roles or expectations are entering the bond from outside sources.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice pressure to perform, comply, lead, submit, or manage that feels situational or imposed.

##Test for##
whether roles originate externally or within the shared field
whether roles can soften, be released, or reorganized now
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

#Trauma Distortions#

Trauma distortions arise when shared or mirrored trauma is held within the relationship field.
The bond itself carries unresolved survival energy.

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Sense whether survival energy is stored in the bond itself.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice fear, urgency, gripping, or collapse when sensing the field.

##Test for##
whether trauma belongs to the shared field or is being mirrored
whether the field is ready to release or reorient to present time
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

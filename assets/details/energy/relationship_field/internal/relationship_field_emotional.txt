#Emotional Distortions#

Emotional distortions arise when unprocessed emotions circulate within the shared relationship field.
They belong to the bond itself, not to one individual alone.

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Tune into the shared space between the two beings and sense how the field feels as a whole.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice images, emotions, body sensations, impulses, or shifts in awareness that arise when focusing on the relationship itself.

##Test for##
whether the distortion belongs to the shared field or originates externally
whether the field is ready to soften, reorganize, or release now
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

#Nervous System Distortions#

Nervous system distortions arise when two nervous systems co-regulate in a survival-based way within the relationship field.
The activation belongs to the bond itself rather than to one being alone.

###Testing Guidance###
Focus on the relationship field rather than on one individual alone.
Tune into the shared space between the two beings and sense how the field feels as a whole.

Use intuition alongside testing.
Notice body sensations, breathing changes, tension, alertness, or collapse when sensing the field.

##Test for##
whether the activation belongs to the shared field or originates externally
whether regulation can return independently for both beings
Sometimes no specific testing is needed

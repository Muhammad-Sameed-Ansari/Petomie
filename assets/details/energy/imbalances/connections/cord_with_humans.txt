#Cords with Humans#

##Location##
Energetic cords form in the subtle body and aura of the animal, connecting to the energy field of humans through emotional or spiritual bonds. 
These cords most commonly attach at the heart, solar plexus, throat, and crown chakras, though they may also connect through the root (security) or sacral (emotional) centers depending on the relationship dynamic.

##Shape##
Cords appear as energetic threads, filaments, or tubes of light that extend between the animal and a human.
They can vary in:
Color: Reflecting emotional tone (e.g., pink for love, gray for exhaustion, red for stress).
Thickness: Stronger or more frequent connections create wider cords.
Flow Direction: Balanced cords allow mutual exchange of compassion and understanding; imbalanced cords may pull energy from one being to another.
These cords are not inherently negative — they are natural connections of empathy, communication, and shared experience. However, when emotions such as fear, guilt, dependency, or grief dominate, the cords may become draining or restrictive.

##Function##
Healthy Cords:
Facilitate communication, empathy, and deep emotional understanding between animal and human
Strengthen trust, bonding, and energetic harmony
Support mutual healing, comfort, and compassion
Allow intuitive awareness — the animal may “feel” the human’s emotions or intentions
Unhealthy or Draining Cords:
Occur when emotional dependency, control, or unresolved trauma disturbs energetic balance
May cause fatigue, restlessness, or emotional changes in the animal
Lead to confusion or difficulty in energetic autonomy (the animal takes on human tension or sadness)
Can disrupt the natural flow of the animal’s own life force and grounding
Healing and Restoration:
Bring awareness to emotional patterns between animal and human (love, fear, guilt, overprotection)
Strengthen boundaries with grounding, intention, and respect for energetic individuality
Use visualization, Reiki, or intention-based cord clearing to dissolve unhealthy attachments while keeping love and connection intact
Reaffirm mutual independence: the animal and human remain energetically linked through heart resonance, not dependency
When cords are balanced, the connection becomes one of pure heart energy — allowing both beings to share love, intuition, and harmony without draining each other’s vitality. The relationship then radiates freedom, trust, and mutual growth at both the energetic and emotional level.

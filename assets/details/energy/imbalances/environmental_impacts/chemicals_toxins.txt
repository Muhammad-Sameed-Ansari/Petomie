#Chemicals and Toxins#

##Location##
The influence of chemicals and toxins affects the entire body and energetic system of the animal.
Physically, these substances accumulate in the liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, fat tissue, skin, and lungs, where detoxification and filtration occur.
Energetically, toxins create dense, sluggish vibrations that disturb the aura, meridians, and chakras, especially the liver, spleen, and solar plexus energy centers.

##Shape##
Not a defined structure, but a layer of imbalance or energetic heaviness caused by external pollutants.
Common sources include:
Airborne toxins: pesticides, exhaust fumes, smoke, and chemical sprays
Ingested substances: contaminated feed, water, medications, or preservatives
Topical exposure: grooming products, fly sprays, cleaning agents
Energetic toxins: electromagnetic radiation, noise pollution, and emotional discord in the environment
The energetic imprint of these substances may appear as dullness or cloudiness within the aura and a sluggish or blocked meridian flow.

##Function##
###Effects on the Animal:###
Overloads the liver, kidneys, and lymphatic systems, leading to poor elimination and inflammation
Weakens the immune system and alters hormonal balance
Reduces energy flow and vibration, creating lethargy or irritability
Disrupts natural intuition, grounding, and energetic sensitivity
Can trigger behavioral changes, skin irritation, respiratory distress, or digestive imbalance
###Energetic Impact:###
Lowers the body’s natural resonance, attracting further imbalance
Creates “static” in communication between cells, chakras, and environmental energies
Blocks natural connection with the earth’s electromagnetic field
###Restoration and Healing:###
Support natural detoxification through clean water, herbs, and gentle nutrition
Strengthen the aura with grounding (earth, sunlight, fresh air) and energy clearing
Reduce exposure to synthetic chemicals wherever possible
Encourage natural rhythms; Rest, movement, and connection with nature
Use energy balancing, Reiki, or frequency-based healing to restore vibrational harmony
When toxins are reduced and energetic flow is cleared, the animal’s vital force regains strength, the aura brightens, and the body’s self-healing intelligence can once again function freely and in alignment with nature.

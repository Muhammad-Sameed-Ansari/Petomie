#Stress & Overwhelm#

##Location##
Affects the entire energetic system, particularly the nervous system, adrenal region, and solar plexus chakra.
It can also be felt in the heart field and aura, where tension, contraction, or disorganization appear when the animal is under continuous strain.

###Shape###
Energetically shows as compressed or chaotic movement within the aura or meridians.
In stress, energy may pulse irregularly or rush upward.
In overwhelm, the energy field becomes dispersed, unstable, or filled with fragmented vibrations.

##Function##
###Stress###
Arises as a natural response to pressure or threat.
Short-term stress can increase alertness and survival instincts.
Chronic stress, however, drains life force, leading to physical fatigue and emotional imbalance.
###Overwhelm###
Occurs when incoming stimuli or emotions exceed the system’s processing capacity.
The energy field becomes overloaded, leading to confusion, anxiety, or withdrawal.
The animal may shut down, pace, hide, or become reactive.

##Energetic Function##
Stress contracts energy flow, especially around the chest, diaphragm, and head, restricting breath and life force movement.
Overwhelm fragments the aura, scattering energy instead of maintaining coherence.
Both states disrupt the connection between grounding (Earth energy) and regulation (Heart and Solar Plexus centers).
Calming touch, rhythmic breathing, nature exposure, and energy clearing help restore flow and coherence.

##Spiritual Connection##
When stress and overwhelm are released, the animal returns to a state of trust, safety, and alignment.
The life force flows harmoniously again, connecting the body to Earth and spirit.
Balanced energy brings emotional clarity, relaxation, and openness — allowing the animal to feel centered, present, and at peace within its environment.

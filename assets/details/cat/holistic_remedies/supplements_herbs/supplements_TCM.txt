#TCM Inspired Supplements#

###About Supplements###
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) views the cat as a highly sensitive being with a strong connection between Qi, Xue (Blood), Yin, Yang, and Shen. TCM-inspired supplements for cats are selected very conservatively to support balance, calm the nervous system, and gently nourish the organ systems.

For best outcomes, it is very important to choose supplements that are free from alcohol and additives. Cats are particularly sensitive to tinctures and concentrated extracts.

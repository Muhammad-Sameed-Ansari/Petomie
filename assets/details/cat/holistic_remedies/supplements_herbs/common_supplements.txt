#Common Supplements#

Common supplements are widely used to support cats physically and nutritionally depending on age, activity level, and health status.

For best outcomes, it is very important to choose supplements that are free from alcohol, artificial additives, fillers, colors, and flavors. Clean, high-quality formulations support the body more gently and are better tolerated by animals.

Supplements listed here may be used for energetic testing or, when appropriate, under professional veterinary guidance for physical use.

#Vagina#

##Location##
The vagina is located within the pelvic cavity, extending from the cervix of the uterus to the external genital opening (vulva).  
It lies dorsal to the urethra and ventral to the rectum, surrounded by connective tissue and smooth muscle.  
The vestibule forms the caudal continuation of the vagina, leading to the vulva.

##Shape##
A flattened muscular tube lined with stratified squamous epithelium that varies in thickness depending on the reproductive cycle.  
It is distensible to accommodate copulation and parturition.  
The cranial portion merges with the cervix, and the caudal portion opens into the vestibule.  
The mucosa contains longitudinal folds and may appear more rugose during estrus.  
The hymen, a thin membrane, marks the transition between vagina and vestibule in young cats.

##Function##
- Serves as the copulatory organ during mating, receiving the penis and sperm.  
- Acts as the passageway for the fetus during birth.  
- Provides drainage for uterine and cervical secretions.  
- Protects the upper reproductive tract from infection through mucosal barriers and resident microflora.  
- Plays a role in pheromonal communication and sexual behavior.

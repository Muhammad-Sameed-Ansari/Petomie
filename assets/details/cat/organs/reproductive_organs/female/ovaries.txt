#Ovaries#

##Location##
The ovaries are paired organs located in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity, just caudal to the kidneys.  
Each ovary lies within a peritoneal pocket called the ovarian bursa, which is formed by the mesovarium and mesosalpinx of the broad ligament.  
They are positioned near the cranial ends of the uterine horns and are supplied by the ovarian arteries and veins.

##Shape##
Small, oval to bean-shaped structures with a smooth outer surface in young cats and a more irregular surface in adults due to follicular activity.  
Each ovary consists of two main regions:  
- **Cortex:** The outer layer containing follicles at various stages of development and the corpus luteum.  
- **Medulla:** The inner region containing blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue.  
The surface is covered by a tunica albuginea and a layer of germinal epithelium.

##Function##
- Produces and releases ova (eggs) during the reproductive cycle (ovulation).  
- Secretes female sex hormones — primarily estrogen and progesterone — that regulate the estrous cycle and secondary sexual characteristics.  
- Supports early pregnancy by maintaining progesterone production through the corpus luteum.  
- Coordinates with the pituitary gland via hormonal feedback to control reproductive activity.  
- Plays a role in sexual behavior and fertility in response to seasonal and hormonal cues.

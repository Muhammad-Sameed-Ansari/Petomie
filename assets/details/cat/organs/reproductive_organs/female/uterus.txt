#Uterus#

##Location##
The uterus is located in the pelvic cavity and extends cranially into the abdominal cavity.  
It lies dorsal to the urinary bladder and ventral to the colon.  
In cats, the uterus is bicornuate — consisting of two long uterine horns that merge into a short uterine body, which continues caudally into the cervix.  
The broad ligaments attach the uterus to the lateral body wall, providing support and containing blood vessels and nerves.

##Shape##
A Y-shaped, hollow, muscular organ composed of smooth muscle layers (myometrium) and a glandular inner lining (endometrium).  
The uterine horns are slender and elongated to accommodate multiple embryos during pregnancy.  
The outer surface is covered by a serous layer (perimetrium).  
The uterine wall varies in thickness and vascularity according to the reproductive cycle and pregnancy status.

##Function##
- Serves as the site for implantation and development of embryos during pregnancy.  
- Provides nourishment to the developing fetuses through the uterine glands and placenta.  
- Contracts to expel fetuses during parturition and to return to normal size postpartum.  
- Produces prostaglandins and other hormones influencing reproductive cycles.  
- Acts as a conduit for sperm transport from the cervix to the oviducts.  
- Plays a key role in maintaining pregnancy and hormonal regulation of reproductive function.

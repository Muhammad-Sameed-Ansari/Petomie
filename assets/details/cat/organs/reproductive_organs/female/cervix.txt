#Cervix#

##Location##
The cervix is located at the junction between the uterus and the vagina within the pelvic cavity.  
It forms the caudal end of the uterus and projects slightly into the cranial portion of the vagina.  
It lies dorsal to the urinary bladder and ventral to the rectum, surrounded by connective tissue and smooth muscle.

##Shape##
A short, firm, cylindrical structure composed of dense connective tissue and smooth muscle fibers.  
The cervical canal runs through its center and is lined by mucus-secreting epithelium.  
The canal is normally closed, opening only during estrus and parturition to allow passage of sperm or fetuses.  
In cats, the cervix is relatively short and narrow compared to that of larger mammals.  
It has internal and external openings known as the internal and external os.

##Function##
- Acts as a barrier between the uterus and vagina, protecting the uterus from ascending infections.  
- Regulates the passage of sperm into the uterus during mating.  
- Produces mucus that changes consistency according to hormonal status — thin during estrus, thick during diestrus.  
- Dilates during parturition to permit the passage of fetuses.  
- Helps maintain pregnancy by sealing the uterine environment.  
- Plays a role in reproductive signaling via cervical mucus changes.

#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

##Location##
The uterine tubes, also known as oviducts or Fallopian tubes, are paired structures extending from the ovaries to the uterine horns.  
They lie within the mesosalpinx, a fold of the broad ligament, and are located in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity near the kidneys.  
Each tube connects the ovarian bursa (which surrounds the ovary) to the tip of the corresponding uterine horn.

##Shape##
Slender, coiled tubular structures composed of smooth muscle and lined with ciliated epithelium.  
Each oviduct consists of three regions:  
- **Infundibulum:** The funnel-shaped opening with fimbriae that capture the ovulated oocyte.  
- **Ampulla:** The wider, central region where fertilization usually occurs.  
- **Isthmus:** The narrow segment leading into the uterine horn.  
The mucosa has longitudinal folds that facilitate movement of the ova and sperm.

##Function##
- Transports oocytes from the ovary to the uterus.  
- Serves as the site of fertilization between oocyte and sperm.  
- Provides a nourishing environment for the early stages of embryo development.  
- Uses ciliary motion and muscular contractions to move the fertilized ova toward the uterus.  
- Acts as a selective barrier, allowing only healthy sperm and embryos to pass.  
- Plays a role in synchronizing embryo arrival with uterine readiness for implantation.

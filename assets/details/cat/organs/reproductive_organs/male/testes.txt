#Testes#

##Location##
The testes are paired male reproductive organs located within the scrotum, ventral to the anus and caudal to the penis.  
They are suspended by the spermatic cords, which contain blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves, and the vas deferens.  
Each testis is enclosed by a protective serous membrane called the tunica vaginalis, derived from the peritoneum.

##Shape##
Oval, smooth, and firm structures surrounded by a dense fibrous capsule known as the tunica albuginea.  
Internally, each testis is divided into lobules containing tightly coiled seminiferous tubules, where sperm production occurs.  
Between the lobules lies interstitial tissue containing Leydig cells that produce testosterone.  
The rete testis collects sperm from the seminiferous tubules and channels it into the efferent ductules leading to the epididymis.

##Function##
- Produces spermatozoa (sperm cells) through spermatogenesis within the seminiferous tubules.  
- Secretes the hormone testosterone, which regulates male secondary sexual characteristics and libido.  
- Supports reproductive function by maintaining optimal temperature for spermatogenesis through scrotal thermoregulation.  
- Provides sperm for storage and maturation in the epididymis.  
- Plays a critical role in hormonal balance and fertility.

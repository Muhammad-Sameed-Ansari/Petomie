#Vas Deferens#

##Location##
The vas deferens (ductus deferens) is a paired tubular structure that extends from the tail of the epididymis to the pelvic urethra.  
It travels through the spermatic cord, passing alongside the testicular vessels and nerves, then enters the abdominal cavity via the inguinal canal.  
It continues along the dorsal surface of the urinary bladder and terminates at the urethra near the prostate.

##Shape##
A narrow, muscular tube composed of smooth muscle with a small lumen.  
It has a thick wall to facilitate the propulsion of sperm through peristaltic contractions.  
The terminal portion expands slightly near the prostate, forming the ampulla before opening into the urethra.  
It is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium supported by connective tissue and circular and longitudinal muscle layers.

##Function##
- Transports mature sperm from the epididymis to the urethra during ejaculation.  
- Stores small amounts of sperm prior to ejaculation.  
- Uses peristaltic contractions to move sperm efficiently through the reproductive tract.  
- Acts as a conduit for sperm mixing with secretions from accessory glands (e.g., prostate).  
- Plays a critical role in male fertility and reproductive function.

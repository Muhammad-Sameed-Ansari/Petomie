#Epididymis#

##Location##
The epididymis is a long, coiled tubular structure located along the dorsal border of each testis within the scrotum.  
It is enclosed by the visceral layer of the vaginal tunic and connected to the testis by efferent ductules.  
It continues caudally as the vas deferens, which exits the scrotum through the spermatic cord.

##Shape##
A crescent-shaped, elongated organ divided into three regions:  
- **Head (Caput):** Lies at the cranial pole of the testis and receives sperm from the efferent ductules.  
- **Body (Corpus):** Extends along the dorsolateral surface of the testis, where sperm mature.  
- **Tail (Cauda):** Located at the caudal end of the testis, serving as a storage site for mature sperm.  
The epididymal duct is highly convoluted and lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium.

##Function##
- Provides a site for sperm maturation, gaining motility and fertilizing ability.  
- Stores sperm until ejaculation.  
- Absorbs testicular fluid and secretes substances essential for sperm viability.  
- Transports sperm to the vas deferens during ejaculation via smooth muscle contractions.  
- Plays a vital role in male fertility and sperm quality regulation.

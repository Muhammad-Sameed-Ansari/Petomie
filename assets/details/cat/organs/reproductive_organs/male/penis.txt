#Penis#

##Location##
The penis is located in the perineal region, ventral to the scrotum and caudal to the prepuce (sheath).  
In cats, it lies directed caudally beneath the anus when not erect, enclosed within the prepuce.  
The urethra runs through its length, carrying urine and semen to the external environment.

##Shape##
A slender, tubular organ composed of erectile tissue, connective tissue, and smooth muscle.  
The distal end bears a small glans penis covered with backward-facing keratinized spines in intact male cats, which stimulate ovulation in the female during mating.  
The penis contains two main erectile bodies — the corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum — and terminates in the urethral opening at the tip.  
The os penis (penile bone) provides structural support during copulation.

##Function##
- Serves as the copulatory organ for transferring semen into the female reproductive tract.  
- Conducts urine from the urinary bladder to the outside via the urethra.  
- Erection is achieved through engorgement of erectile tissue with blood during sexual arousal.  
- Stimulates induced ovulation in females through the mechanical action of penile spines.  
- Plays a role in reproductive success and species-specific mating behavior.  
- Retracts into the prepuce when not in use, protecting it from injury or contamination.

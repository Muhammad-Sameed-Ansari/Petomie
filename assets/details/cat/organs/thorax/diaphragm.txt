#Diaphragm (Muscle)#

##Location##
The diaphragm is a **thin, dome-shaped muscle** that separates the **thoracic cavity** from the **abdominal cavity**.  
It sits beneath the lungs and heart and moves with each breath.

###Shape###
Curved upward when relaxed and flattens as it contracts during inhalation.  
It attaches to the **ribs, spine, and sternum**, linking upper and lower body movement.

##Function##
- Main **muscle for breathing** — contracts to draw air in and relaxes to push air out.  
- Assists in **blood circulation** and **organ motion**.  
- Works closely with the **lungs** to create breathing rhythm and balance pressure between cavities.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) — confidence, vitality, and flow.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Liver and Spleen Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Acts as a **bridge between emotions of the heart and the gut**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as shallow breathing, tension, or nervous energy.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Deep, flowing breath, calm emotional state, relaxed body.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle belly breathing, stretching, and relaxation promote diaphragmatic harmony.

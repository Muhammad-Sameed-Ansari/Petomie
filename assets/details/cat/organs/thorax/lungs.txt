#Lungs#

##Location##
The lungs are located in the **thoracic cavity**, protected by the **ribcage** and surrounding the **heart**.  
They extend from the **shoulder region** down to the **diaphragm**, filling most of the chest space.

###Shape###
Soft, **spongy organs** made up of multiple lobes.  
- **Left lung:** two lobes.  
- **Right lung:** four lobes.  
Covered by a thin membrane called the **pleura**, which allows smooth, friction-free movement as the cat breathes.

##Function##
- Absorb **oxygen** and release **carbon dioxide**.  
- Maintain **acid–base balance** and regulate body temperature.  
- Filter small particles and germs from inhaled air.  
- Work together with the **heart and diaphragm** to support circulation and energy flow.

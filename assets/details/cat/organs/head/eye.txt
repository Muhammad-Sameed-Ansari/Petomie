#Head – Eye#

##Location##
The eyes are positioned on the **front of the cat’s head**, giving them good **depth perception** for hunting and climbing.  
They sit within **bony sockets (orbits)**, protected by **eyelids**, **lashes**, and a **third eyelid (nictitating membrane)** that slides across the eye for protection and moisture.

###Shape###
Rounded organs with several layers:  
- **Cornea:** clear outer surface that focuses incoming light.  
- **Iris:** colored ring that adjusts the size of the pupil.  
- **Lens:** bends light toward the retina.  
- **Retina:** inner layer with light-sensitive rods and cones.  
Cats have many **rod cells** for excellent night vision and motion detection, but fewer **cone cells**, so they see limited color.  
The **optic nerve** carries visual information from the retina to the brain.

##Function##
- Detects **light, movement, and shape** with strong night vision.  
- Allows excellent **peripheral and depth perception**, aiding in hunting and balance.  
- The **third eyelid** keeps the eye moist and clean.  
- Reflective cells behind the retina form the **tapetum lucidum**, which boosts vision in low light and causes their eyes to glow at night.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) — intuition, perception, and clarity.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Liver Meridian (eye health and vision) and Gallbladder Meridian (side vision and coordination).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The eyes represent **how one perceives and trusts life**.  
  - Imbalance may cause nervousness, fear of the unknown, or avoidance.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Clear vision, confidence, intuitive awareness.  
- **Energetic Support:** Soft lighting, gentle touch around the head, and calm surroundings enhance visual balance and inner clarity.

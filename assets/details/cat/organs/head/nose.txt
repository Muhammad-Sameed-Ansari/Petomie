#Head – Nose#

##Location##
The nose sits on the **front of the face**, forming the first part of the **respiratory system**.  
It includes the **nostrils (nares)**, **nasal passages**, and **olfactory bulbs** that process smell.  
The area is highly sensitive, helping the cat detect scents and navigate the environment.

###Shape###
Two small **nostrils** lead into narrow nasal passages lined with mucous membranes and fine hairs that **filter and warm** the air.  
At the back are **olfactory receptors**, which send scent signals through nerves to the brain.  
The outer part of the nose, the **rhinarium**, is moist and textured to trap scent particles.

##Function##
- Detects **scents** that identify other animals, food, and surroundings.  
- Plays a key role in **social and emotional communication** — cats recognize people and territory through smell.  
- Filters, warms, and humidifies incoming air.  
- Works with the **vomeronasal organ (Jacobson’s organ)** in the roof of the mouth to sense pheromones and emotional cues.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Root Chakra (Muladhara) — safety, grounding, and instinct.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Lung Meridian (breath and purity) and Large Intestine Meridian (letting go of tension).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The nose represents **instinct, curiosity, and connection to the world**.  
  - Imbalance may cause tension, avoidance, or shallow breathing.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm curiosity, deep grounding, connection to surroundings.  
- **Energetic Support:** Grounding scents, natural air, and gentle stroking around the nose support both breath and energy flow.

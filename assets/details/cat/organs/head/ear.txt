#Head – Ear#

##Location##
The ears are located on the **top of the cat’s head**, and can **rotate up to 180 degrees** to pinpoint sound from all directions.  
Each ear has three sections — **outer, middle, and inner ear** — that work together for hearing and balance.

###Shape###
- **Outer Ear (Pinna):** funnel-shaped cartilage that captures sound waves.  
- **Ear Canal:** carries sound to the eardrum.  
- **Middle Ear:** holds three tiny bones (malleus, incus, stapes) that transmit vibrations.  
- **Inner Ear:** contains the **cochlea** (hearing) and **vestibular system** (balance and spatial orientation).

##Function##
- Detects **high-frequency sounds**, often beyond human hearing.  
- Helps locate **direction and distance** of sound with precision.  
- Maintains **balance** and orientation through the vestibular system.  
- Communicates emotion — ear position reflects curiosity, aggression, fear, or calmness.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) — communication, truth, and listening.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Kidney Meridian (deep hearing and intuition) and Small Intestine Meridian (clarity and discernment).  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The ears reflect **how one listens — both externally and inwardly**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as sensitivity to sound, irritability, or avoidance.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm attentiveness, emotional harmony, deep intuitive hearing.  
- **Energetic Support:** Quiet spaces, soft sound healing, and relaxed human tone help stabilize the ear’s energetic field.

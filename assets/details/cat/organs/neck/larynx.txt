#Larynx#

##Location##
The larynx, or **voice box**, sits in the **front of the neck**, between the **pharynx** (throat) and the **trachea** (windpipe).  
It’s part of the **respiratory system** and also produces the cat’s vocal sounds.

###Shape###
A short, **cartilage-based structure** supported by muscles and ligaments.  
Inside are two small **vocal folds** that vibrate when air passes through, creating sound.  
In cats, it’s responsible for meowing, hissing, growling, and purring.

##Function##
- **Controls airflow** between throat and lungs.  
- Produces **sound and vibration** for communication.  
- Protects the airway during swallowing by closing the entrance to the trachea.  
- Works with the **pharynx** and **mouth** for vocal tone and resonance.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) — expression and communication.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Triple Heater Meridian — regulates breath and vocal energy.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents **how one expresses or suppresses emotion**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as excessive meowing, silence, or throat irritation.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Clear communication, calm breathing, and relaxed vocal tone.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle neck massage, soft vocal tones, and calm presence promote harmony in this area.

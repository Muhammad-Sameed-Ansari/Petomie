#Pharynx#

The pharynx lies behind the **mouth and nasal cavity** and connects to both the **esophagus** (for food) and **larynx** (for air).  
It’s part of both the **digestive** and **respiratory systems**.

###Shape###
A short, **muscular tube** lined with mucous membrane.  
It includes the **soft palate** and **epiglottis**, which guide air and food to their correct passages.

##Function##
- Directs **food to the esophagus** and **air to the trachea**.  
- Assists in **swallowing** and **breathing coordination**.  
- Plays a part in **sound resonance**.

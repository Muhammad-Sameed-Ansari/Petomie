#Scapula#

##Location##
The scapula, or shoulder blade, lies along the side of the cat’s thorax, attached to the body solely by muscles rather than a bone joint.  
It extends from the top of the shoulder down toward the upper arm, positioned in a flexible angle that allows remarkable freedom of motion.

###Shape###
A flat, triangular bone with a prominent spine running across one surface.  
The lower end forms a shallow socket (glenoid cavity) for articulation with the humerus.

###Parts###

##Spine of the Scapula##
A raised ridge dividing the bone’s outer surface.  
Energetically, it symbolizes structure and graceful coordination.

##Supraspinous Fossa##
The upper area above the spine that holds the supraspinatus muscle.  
Energetically, represents preparation and alertness.

##Infraspinous Fossa##
The lower section beneath the spine, anchoring the infraspinatus muscle.  
Energetically, embodies fluid motion and expression.

##Glenoid Cavity##
The lower socket where the humerus connects to form the shoulder joint.  
Energetically, mirrors balance between strength and sensitivity.

###Function###
Supports the forelimb by anchoring strong shoulder muscles.  
Allows wide ranges of movement necessary for agility, climbing, and pouncing.

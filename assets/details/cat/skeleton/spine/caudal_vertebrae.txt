#Caudal Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located in the tail region, extending from the sacrum to the tip of the tail.  
Cats typically have **20–23 caudal vertebrae (Cd1–Cd23)**, which vary in size and shape along the tail.

###Parts###
1. **Cd1–Cd5** – Proximal vertebrae.  
   Larger and more structured, articulating with the sacrum.  
   Provide flexibility at the tail base.

2. **Cd6–Cd15** – Middle vertebrae.  
   Smaller and more cylindrical.  
   Allow the tail to bend, twist, and balance during movement.

3. **Cd16–Cd23** – Distal vertebrae near the tip.  
   Tiny, rod-like bones that taper to the end of the tail.  
   Maintain agility and fine control.

##Function##
 Support the tail and provide balance.  
 Aid in communication and body language.  
 Help in coordination, jumping, and turning.  
 Assist in grooming and emotional expression.

#Thoracic Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located in the upper back region, between the cervical and lumbar vertebrae.  
Cats typically have **13 thoracic vertebrae (T1–T13)**, each associated with a pair of ribs.

###Parts###
1. **T1–T3** – Upper thoracic vertebrae near the shoulders.  
   Short spinous processes that slope backward.  
   Articulate with the first few ribs and assist in shoulder movement.

2. **T4–T10** – Mid-thoracic vertebrae.  
   Long spinous processes for attachment of back muscles.  
   Provide stability and flexibility of the rib cage.

3. **T11–T13** – Posterior thoracic vertebrae.  
   Shorter spinous processes and transition to lumbar region.  
   Support the caudal ribs and contribute to spinal flexibility.

##Function##
 Protect the thoracic portion of the spinal cord.  
 Serve as attachment points for ribs and muscles of respiration.  
 Support the rib cage and aid in breathing.  
 Maintain body posture and distribute weight evenly along the spine.

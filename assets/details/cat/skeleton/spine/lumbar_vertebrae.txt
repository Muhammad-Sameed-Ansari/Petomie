#Lumbar Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located between the thoracic and sacral vertebrae in the lower back region.  
Cats typically have **7 lumbar vertebrae (L1–L7)**, which are large and strong to support flexibility and agility.

###Parts###
1. **L1–L3** – Upper lumbar vertebrae.  
   Long transverse processes that extend laterally for muscle attachment.  
   Support abdominal and spinal muscles.

2. **L4–L7** – Lower lumbar vertebrae.  
   Broader and shorter processes to bear weight and allow back flexion.  
   Provide attachment for muscles involved in jumping and arching the spine.

##Function##
 Provide flexibility and strength in the lower back.  
 Protect spinal nerves and support the abdomen.  
 Allow extension, flexion, and lateral bending.  
 Contribute to jumping, crouching, and agile movement.

#Cervical Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located in the neck region, connecting the skull to the thoracic vertebrae.  
Cats typically have **7 cervical vertebrae (C1–C7)**, which allow for high flexibility and movement of the head and neck.

###Parts###
1. **Atlas (C1)** – The first cervical vertebra.  
   Supports the skull and allows nodding motion (“yes” movement).  
   Lacks a vertebral body and has large wings for muscle attachment.

2. **Axis (C2)** – The second cervical vertebra.  
   Features the **dens (odontoid process)**, a peg-like projection that allows rotational movement (“no” motion) of the head.

3. **C3–C6** – Middle cervical vertebrae.  
   Smaller and more uniform in shape.  
   Provide flexibility and muscle attachment for neck motion.

4. **C7** – The last cervical vertebra connecting to the thoracic region.  
   Distinct with a longer spinous process and articular surface for the first rib.

##Function##
 Support and move the head and neck.  
 Protect the spinal cord.  
 Provide attachment for neck and shoulder muscles.  
 Allow a wide range of motion for predation, grooming, and balance.

#Sacral Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located between the lumbar and caudal (tail) vertebrae, forming the sacrum.  
Cats typically have **3 sacral vertebrae (S1–S3)**, fused into a single structure that connects the spine to the pelvis.

###Parts###
1. **S1** – The first sacral vertebra, articulating with the last lumbar vertebra (L7).  
   Forms the sacroiliac joint with the pelvis.  
   Transmits weight from the spine to the hind limbs.

2. **S2** – Middle portion of the sacrum.  
   Provides attachment for pelvic ligaments and muscles of the hindquarters.

3. **S3** – Posterior portion articulating with the first caudal vertebra (Cd1).  
   Marks the transition between the sacrum and tail.

##Function##
 Connects the spine to the pelvis.  
 Transfers body weight to the hind limbs.  
 Stabilizes the pelvis during locomotion.  
 Supports the hindquarters and tail movement.

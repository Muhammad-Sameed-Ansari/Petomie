#Os Penis (Baculum)#

##Location##
Present in male cats, located within the penis along the dorsal aspect of the urethra. It lies embedded in the fibroelastic tissue near the distal end of the penis, just proximal to the glans.

##Shape##
A small, slender bone varying in length and shape among individuals. It is rod-like, slightly curved, and tapered toward its distal end. The bone is surrounded by connective and erectile tissue, providing internal rigidity to the penile structure.

##Function##
Supports and stiffens the penis during copulation.
Facilitates intromission and aids in reproductive success.
Serves as a species-specific feature of male carnivores, absent in females.

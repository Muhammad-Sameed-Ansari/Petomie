#Scapula#

##Location##
Located on the lateral side of the thorax, overlaying the ribs.  
The scapula is a flat, roughly triangular bone that forms the shoulder blade in the cat.  
It connects the forelimb to the body through muscles instead of a bony joint, allowing wide range of motion and stealthy movement.

###Parts###
1. **Spine of the Scapula** – Prominent ridge on the lateral surface dividing the bone into two fossae.  
   Provides attachment for the trapezius and deltoid muscles.  
   Ends distally at the acromion.

2. **Supraspinous Fossa** – Shallow depression above the spine.  
   Houses the supraspinatus muscle that extends the shoulder joint.

3. **Infraspinous Fossa** – Larger depression below the spine.  
   Contains the infraspinatus muscle which stabilizes and abducts the shoulder.

4. **Acromion** – Flattened projection at the distal end of the spine.  
   Provides attachment for the acromial part of the deltoid muscle.  
   Serves as a key landmark in the cat’s shoulder.

5. **Glenoid Cavity** – Shallow socket at the distal end of the scapula.  
   Articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint.

6. **Supraglenoid Tubercle** – Raised area just above the glenoid cavity.  
   Origin point for the biceps brachii muscle, contributing to forelimb flexion.

7. **Coracoid Process** – Small projection on the medial side near the glenoid cavity.  
   Serves as attachment for stabilizing ligaments of the shoulder.

8. **Neck of the Scapula** – Narrow region connecting the body and glenoid cavity.  
   Supports the articulation area and provides flexibility during movement.

##Function##
 Supports the shoulder and provides a wide surface for muscle attachment.  
 Forms the foundation for limb movement and joint stability.  
 Enables flexible and silent motion necessary for feline agility.  
 Protects underlying thoracic structures and contributes to locomotor balance.  
 Assists in distributing forces during jumping, running, and climbing.

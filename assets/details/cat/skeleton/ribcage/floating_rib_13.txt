#Floating Ribs#

##Location##
Located at the caudal (rear) end of the ribcage, following the false ribs.  
In cats, there are typically **13 pairs of ribs**, with the **13th pair** classified as floating ribs.  
These ribs attach dorsally to the last thoracic vertebra (T13) but do not connect to the sternum or the costal arch.  
They end freely within the abdominal musculature.

###Parts###
1. **Rib 13 (Floating Rib)** – The final and smallest rib in the thoracic series.  
   Attaches dorsally to the 13th thoracic vertebra (T13).  
   Has a short shaft and lacks a ventral cartilage connection to the sternum.  
   Embedded in the lateral abdominal muscles, providing slight protection for the posterior thoracic and upper abdominal organs.

2. **Cartilaginous Tip** – Reduced or absent in most cats.  
   Ends freely in muscle tissue rather than joining another rib.  
   Contributes to flexibility and expansion of the posterior ribcage.

##Function##
 Protects the caudal portion of the thoracic cavity and the upper abdominal organs.  
 Provides flexibility at the rear of the ribcage for breathing and movement.  
 Serves as an attachment site for intercostal and abdominal muscles.  
 Aids in trunk movement and supports the flexibility of the cat’s body.  
 Allows greater mobility and agility during bending, twisting, or stretching.

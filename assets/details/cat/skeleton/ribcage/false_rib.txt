#False Ribs#

##Location##
Located in the caudal (rear) portion of the ribcage, between the true and floating ribs.  
In cats, there are typically **13 pairs of ribs**, with **ribs 9–12** classified as false ribs because they do not attach directly to the sternum.  
Instead, their costal cartilages connect indirectly through the cartilage of the preceding ribs, forming part of the costal arch.

###Parts###
1. **Rib 9** – The first of the false ribs.  
   Attaches dorsally to the ninth thoracic vertebra (T9).  
   Ventrally connects via cartilage to rib 8, forming part of the costal arch.  
   Provides protection for the posterior portion of the lungs and diaphragm region.

2. **Rib 10** – Slightly shorter and more flexible than rib 9.  
   Connects dorsally to T10 and ventrally joins the cartilage of the rib in front.  
   Contributes to chest wall flexibility and assists in respiratory motion.

3. **Rib 11** – Forms part of the lower thoracic wall.  
   Provides protection for the liver and upper abdominal organs.  
   Supports intercostal muscles that help with breathing and trunk stability.

4. **Rib 12** – The last of the false ribs before the floating rib.  
   Shorter and more angled toward the abdomen.  
   Connects loosely via cartilage to the preceding rib and provides mobility to the posterior thorax.

##Function##
 Protects the lower thoracic and upper abdominal organs such as the liver, stomach, and spleen.  
 Provides flexibility and expansion of the chest during respiration.  
 Serves as attachment sites for intercostal and abdominal muscles.  
 Supports movement, stability, and breathing coordination.  
 Contributes to the elasticity and adaptability of the thoracic wall.

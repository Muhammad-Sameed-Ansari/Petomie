#Sternum#

##Location##
Located along the midline of the chest, forming the ventral (bottom) portion of the thoracic cage.  
In cats, the sternum is composed of **eight sternebrae**, running from the manubrium at the front to the xiphoid process at the rear.  
It provides the main ventral attachment point for the true ribs and protects the thoracic organs beneath it.

###Parts###
1. **Manubrium** – The cranial (front) part of the sternum.  
   Broad and slightly curved, providing articulation for the first pair of ribs.  
   Serves as an attachment point for neck and pectoral muscles including the sternocephalicus.  
   Marks the upper boundary of the thoracic cavity.

2. **Body of the Sternum (Corpus Sterni)** – Formed by six middle sternebrae.  
   Extends caudally from the manubrium to the xiphoid process.  
   Provides attachment for the true ribs via costal cartilage.  
   Offers protection for the heart and major blood vessels within the thoracic cavity.

3. **Sternebrae (Individual Segments)** – Typically eight small bones that may remain partially distinct in younger cats.  
   Contribute to flexibility in the chest wall during breathing and movement.  
   Fuse with maturity to provide a firm base for the ribcage.

4. **Xiphoid Process** – The caudal (rear) segment of the sternum.  
   Often cartilaginous in young cats and may become ossified with age.  
   Serves as an attachment for abdominal muscles such as the rectus abdominis.  
   Marks the transition between the thoracic and abdominal cavities.

##Function##
 Provides structural support to the ribcage and thoracic cavity.  
 Protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs.  
 Acts as the main attachment site for true ribs through costal cartilage.  
 Supports the action of breathing by maintaining chest wall integrity.  
 Serves as an anchor point for pectoral and abdominal muscles.

#True Ribs#

##Location##
Located in the cranial (front) part of the thoracic cavity, directly attached to the sternum through costal cartilage.  
In cats, there are **13 pairs of ribs**, and the **first 8 pairs (Ribs 1–8)** are classified as true ribs.  
These ribs form the rigid, protective framework of the upper thoracic cage.

###Parts###
1. **Rib 1** – The shortest and most curved rib.  
   Attaches dorsally to the first thoracic vertebra (T1) and ventrally to the manubrium of the sternum.  
   Protects large blood vessels entering and leaving the chest.  
   Provides attachment for neck and pectoral muscles such as the scalenus.

2. **Rib 2** – Slightly longer than the first rib and connects to T2.  
   Strengthens the front portion of the thoracic wall.  
   Supports movement during breathing and provides stability to the shoulder region.

3. **Rib 3** – Attaches to T3 and the sternum via flexible cartilage.  
   Protects the cranial portion of the lungs and the heart.  
   Serves as a key point for intercostal muscle attachment.

4. **Rib 4** – Connects to T4 and contributes to the mid-upper thoracic wall.  
   Provides protection for the heart and great vessels.  
   Helps maintain structural integrity of the ribcage during motion.

5. **Rib 5** – Attaches to T5 and forms part of the mid-thoracic region.  
   Protects deeper portions of the lungs.  
   Provides muscle attachment for breathing and trunk movement.

6. **Rib 6** – Slightly longer and more flexible, connected to T6.  
   Contributes to the mechanical expansion of the chest during inhalation.  
   Protects both lungs and upper abdominal organs during movement.

7. **Rib 7** – Attaches to T7 and the sternum via cartilage.  
   Protects the diaphragm and lower portions of the lungs.  
   Assists in flexible movement of the thoracic wall.

8. **Rib 8** – The last true rib before the false ribs.  
   Attaches to T8 dorsally and the sternum ventrally through costal cartilage.  
   Provides transitional flexibility between the true and false rib segments.

##Function##
 Protects vital thoracic organs including the heart and lungs.  
 Provides structure and stability to the upper ribcage.  
 Supports respiration through expansion and contraction of the thoracic cavity.  
 Serves as attachment sites for intercostal and pectoral muscles.  
 Contributes to flexibility and motion of the chest during breathing and locomotion.

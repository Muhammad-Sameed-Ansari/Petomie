#Phalanges#

##Location##
Located in the forepaw beyond the metacarpals, forming the digits (toes).  
Each of the four main toes and the dewclaw (first digit) is made up of a series of phalanges.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal Phalanx** – The first bone of each digit.  
   Articulates with the corresponding metacarpal bone.  
   Provides attachment for flexor and extensor tendons.

2. **Middle Phalanx** – The second bone in digits II–V (absent in the first digit).  
   Shorter than the proximal phalanx and connects to the distal phalanx.  
   Enables flexibility of the paw during grasping and landing.

3. **Distal Phalanx** – The terminal bone forming the core of each claw.  
   Covered by the keratinized claw sheath and equipped with a retractable mechanism.  
   Provides anchorage for the deep digital flexor tendon, allowing precise control of the claws.

##Function##
 Provide structure for the digits and claws.  
 Enable grasping, scratching, and climbing.  
 Absorb impact during jumping and landing.  
 Contribute to fine motor control and stability of the forepaw.

#Sesamoid Bones#

##Location##
Small bones embedded within tendons near the joints of the forelimb, particularly around the wrist and digits.  
They assist in reducing friction and increasing tendon leverage.

###Parts###
1. **Palmar Sesamoids (at Metacarpophalangeal Joints)** – Located on the palmar surface at the base of each toe.  
   Paired bones that protect tendons as they pass over the joints.  
   Aid in distributing stress during flexion.

2. **Dorsal Sesamoids** – Smaller sesamoid bones found on the dorsal aspect of the digits.  
   Help guide tendons and provide balance during extension.

3. **Sesamoid of the Abductor Pollicis Longus** – Found near the first digit (dewclaw).  
   Enhances leverage for thumb movement and stability.

##Function##
 Increase mechanical efficiency of tendons.  
 Reduce friction and wear during flexion and extension.  
 Stabilize the joints and assist in smooth limb movement.  
 Support precise paw motion during climbing and landing.

#Metacarpals#

##Location##
Located in the forelimb between the carpal bones (wrist) and the proximal phalanges (digits).  
The metacarpals form the main body of the paw and provide the framework that connects the carpus to the toes.

###Parts###
1. **Metacarpal Bones I–V** – Five elongated bones arranged side by side.  
   - **Metacarpal I**: Shortest and most medial, associated with the dewclaw.  
   - **Metacarpals II–V**: Longer bones supporting the main weight-bearing digits.  
   Each articulates proximally with a carpal bone and distally with a proximal phalanx.

2. **Proximal Articulations** – Joints between the metacarpals and carpal bones.  
   Provide flexibility and limited rotation for paw adjustment.

3. **Distal Articulations** – Joints connecting the metacarpals to the proximal phalanges.  
   Transmit motion and force during movement.

##Function##
 Support the paw and connect the carpus to the digits.  
 Provide flexibility for walking, climbing, and pouncing.  
 Transmit force from the limb to the ground.  
 Maintain balance and dexterity in the cat’s forelimb.

#Ulna#

##Location##
Located alongside the radius in the forelimb, extending from the elbow to the wrist.  
In the cat, the ulna remains distinct from the radius, allowing greater flexibility and rotation compared to many other species.

###Parts###
1. **Olecranon Process** – The prominent projection forming the point of the elbow.  
   Serves as the insertion point for the triceps brachii muscle.  
   Provides leverage for limb extension and powerful pushing or jumping actions.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, slender section of the bone that runs parallel to the radius.  
   Provides attachment for muscles and connective tissue that control forelimb rotation.  
   Ensures stability while maintaining mobility.

3. **Distal End** – The lower end of the ulna articulating with the carpal bones.  
   Features the **styloid process**, which connects to the wrist ligaments.  
   Contributes to wrist movement and stability.

##Function##
 Forms part of the forearm’s skeletal framework.  
 Provides leverage for elbow extension and forelimb propulsion.  
 Supports muscles that rotate and stabilize the paw.  
 Enhances flexibility and coordination of the forelimb during locomotion.  
 Contributes to precise movements such as climbing, pouncing, and grooming.

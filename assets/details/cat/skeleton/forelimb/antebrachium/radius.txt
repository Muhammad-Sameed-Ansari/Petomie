#Radius#

##Location##
Located in the forelimb between the elbow (humerus) above and the carpus (wrist) below.  
The radius is the main weight-bearing bone of the forearm, forming the structural axis for motion and strength.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal End** – Upper section articulating with the humerus at the elbow joint.  
   Includes the **head of the radius**, which fits into the capitulum of the humerus, and the **radial tuberosity**, an attachment for the biceps brachii muscle.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, slightly curved central portion of the bone.  
   Provides attachment for forearm muscles and supports stability during limb motion.  
   Lies closely beside the ulna, allowing limited rotation for precise limb movement.

3. **Distal End** – Lower section articulating with the carpal bones.  
   Contains the **styloid process**, which anchors ligaments of the wrist and ensures joint stability.  
   Forms the major part of the radiocarpal joint.

##Function##
 Acts as the primary support bone of the forearm.  
 Enables flexion, extension, and rotation of the forelimb.  
 Provides attachment for muscles controlling the paw and elbow.  
 Transmits force from the upper limb to the wrist.  
 Stabilizes the forearm during walking, climbing, and jumping.

#Distal Row of Tarsal Bones#

##Location##
Located in the lower section of the tarsus (hock), between the central tarsal bone above and the metatarsal bones below.  
This row consists of four small, cuboidal bones (Tarsal I–IV) that connect the mid-hock to the paw, providing flexibility and stability.

###Parts###
1. **First Tarsal Bone (Tarsal I)** – The smallest and most medial bone.  
   Articulates with the central tarsal bone above and the first metatarsal bone below.  
   Supports the inner side of the paw and assists in balancing during walking.

2. **Second Tarsal Bone (Tarsal II)** – Positioned between the first and third tarsal bones.  
   Articulates proximally with the central tarsal bone and distally with the second metatarsal bone.  
   Provides connection and alignment for the medial portion of the paw.

3. **Third Tarsal Bone (Tarsal III)** – Located lateral to Tarsal II.  
   Articulates with the central tarsal bone and the third metatarsal bone.  
   Plays a key role in weight distribution and paw flexibility.

4. **Fourth Tarsal Bone (Tarsal IV)** – The largest of the distal tarsals, positioned laterally.  
   Articulates with the calcaneus and central tarsal bones above and the fourth and fifth metatarsals below.  
   Contributes to strength, lateral stability, and shock absorption in the paw.

##Function##
 Form the distal part of the tarsus connecting to the metatarsals.  
 Provide flexibility and alignment for paw motion.  
 Distribute weight evenly during standing, walking, and jumping.  
 Support agility and balance by stabilizing the hock-paw connection.  
 Allow smooth energy transfer from the leg to the foot.

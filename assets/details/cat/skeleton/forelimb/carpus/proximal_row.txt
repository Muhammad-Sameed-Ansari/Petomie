#Proximal Row of Tarsal Bones#

##Location##
Located at the upper part of the hock joint, between the tibia and fibula above and the central tarsal bone below.  
The proximal row of the cat’s tarsus consists of two major bones — the talus and the calcaneus — which together form the foundation of the hock and provide strength and motion to the hindlimb.

###Parts###
1. **Talus (Tibial Tarsal Bone)** – Medial and dorsal bone of the proximal row.  
   Articulates with the tibia to form the main hinge joint of the hock.  
   Features a pulley-shaped surface (trochlea) that guides flexion and extension.  
   Transmits weight from the tibia to the lower tarsal bones.

2. **Calcaneus (Fibular Tarsal Bone)** – Lateral and posterior bone forming the heel.  
   Extends backward to create the calcaneal tuber (point of the hock).  
   Serves as the attachment point for the Achilles tendon.  
   Provides leverage for powerful flexor muscles of the hindlimb.  
   Articulates with the talus above and the fourth tarsal bone below.

##Function##
 Form the upper structure of the hock joint.  
 Support the transfer of weight from the leg to the foot.  
 Enable flexion, extension, and propulsion during movement.  
 Provide attachment sites for major tendons and ligaments.  
 Maintain stability and balance of the hindlimb during walking and jumping.

#Humerus#

##Location##
Located in the upper forelimb between the scapula (shoulder blade) and the radius and ulna (forearm bones).  
The humerus forms the foundation of the upper limb and articulates proximally with the scapula at the shoulder joint and distally with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.

###Parts###
1. **Head** – Rounded proximal end of the humerus.  
   Articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the shoulder (glenohumeral) joint.  
   Allows wide range of motion including flexion, extension, and rotation.

2. **Neck** – Narrow region below the head connecting it to the shaft.  
   Provides attachment for joint capsule and surrounding muscles.

3. **Greater Tubercle** – Large lateral projection beside the head.  
   Serves as the main attachment point for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles that stabilize the shoulder joint.

4. **Lesser Tubercle** – Smaller medial projection.  
   Provides attachment for the subscapularis muscle, aiding in limb rotation and stabilization.

5. **Body (Shaft)** – Long central portion of the bone.  
   Supports muscles responsible for limb movement and strength.  
   Houses nutrient foramina for blood vessel entry.

6. **Deltoid Tuberosity** – Lateral ridge midway along the shaft.  
   Attachment site for the deltoid muscle, which flexes and rotates the limb.

7. **Distal End** – Lower portion articulating with the radius and ulna.  
   Features:  
   - **Condyles**: Rounded surfaces forming part of the elbow joint.  
   - **Epicondyles**: Medial and lateral projections for muscle and ligament attachment.  
   - **Olecranon Fossa**: Deep depression that accommodates the olecranon process of the ulna during limb extension.

##Function##
 Forms the main structural framework of the upper forelimb.  
 Connects the shoulder to the forearm and transmits muscular force.  
 Provides leverage for climbing, walking, and jumping.  
 Allows extensive motion through the shoulder and elbow joints.  
 Serves as attachment for major muscles involved in forelimb strength and control.

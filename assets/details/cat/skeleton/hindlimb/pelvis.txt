#Pelvis#

##Location##
Located at the base of the vertebral column, forming the connection between the spine and hindlimbs.  
The cat’s pelvis is composed of two symmetrical halves, each made up of three fused bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis.  
Both sides meet at the pelvic symphysis and articulate dorsally with the sacrum at the sacroiliac joints.

###Parts###
1. **Ilium** – The largest and most cranial pelvic bone.  
   - **Wing (Ala of Ilium)**: Broad surface forming the upper side of the pelvis.  
   - **Iliac Crest**: Curved dorsal ridge palpable beneath the skin.  
   - **Tuber Sacrale and Tuber Coxae**: Provide attachment for back and gluteal muscles.  
   Articulates with the sacrum to transmit weight from the spine to the hindlimbs.

2. **Ischium** – Forms the caudal portion of the pelvis.  
   - **Ischial Tuberosity**: Strong bony prominence that serves as an attachment site for hamstring muscles.  
   - **Ischial Arch**: Caudal boundary of the pelvic outlet.  
   Provides leverage for limb extension during jumping and running.

3. **Pubis** – The smallest and most ventral bone of the pelvis.  
   - **Pubic Symphysis**: Cartilaginous joint connecting the two halves of the pelvis.  
   - **Pecten of Pubis**: Ridge for attachment of abdominal muscles.  
   Supports the pelvic floor and stabilizes reproductive organs.

4. **Acetabulum** – Deep socket formed by the fusion of the ilium, ischium, and pubis.  
   Articulates with the head of the femur to form the hip joint.  
   Ensures smooth motion and stability of the hindlimb.

5. **Pelvic Cavity** – Space enclosed by the pelvic bones.  
   Contains sections of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts.  
   Narrow and elongated, aiding streamlined movement and flexibility.

##Function##
 Supports and connects the hindlimbs to the vertebral column.  
 Transmits body weight to the legs during movement.  
 Provides attachment for strong muscles of propulsion.  
 Protects internal pelvic organs.  
 Maintains stability and flexibility essential for climbing and jumping.

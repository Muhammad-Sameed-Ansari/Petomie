#Phalanges#

##Location##
Form the digits (toes) of the hindlimb, extending from the metatarsals to the claws.  
Each digit contains three phalanges, except the first, which has two.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal Phalanx** – The first bone of each toe.  
   Articulates with the corresponding metatarsal bone.  
   Provides attachment for flexor tendons enabling toe movement.

2. **Middle Phalanx** – The intermediate bone between proximal and distal phalanges.  
   Shorter and smaller, allowing fine control of toe motion.

3. **Distal Phalanx** – The terminal bone forming the core of the claw.  
   Curved and sharp, covered by the keratinized claw sheath.  
   Supports the retractable claw mechanism controlled by digital flexor and extensor tendons.

##Function##
 Enable precise control and retraction of claws.  
 Assist in walking, climbing, and grasping.  
 Provide flexibility and grip for agile movement.  
 Bear weight and absorb impact during locomotion.

#Sesamoid Bones#

##Location##
Small bones embedded within tendons at major joint regions.  
In the cat’s hindlimb, sesamoid bones are found around the stifle, hock, and digits, serving to improve tendon efficiency and protect joints.

###Parts###
1. **Patella (Kneecap)** – The largest sesamoid bone located in front of the stifle joint.  
   Embedded in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle.  
   Enhances leverage for limb extension.

2. **Proximal Sesamoids** – Found at the back of the metatarsophalangeal joints (base of the toes).  
   Paired small bones that guide tendons and prevent hyperextension.

3. **Distal Sesamoids** – Located near the distal interphalangeal joints (tip of the toes).  
   Aid in smooth tendon movement during flexion and retraction of the claws.

##Function##
 Improve tendon leverage and reduce friction.  
 Stabilize joints and assist in flexion and extension.  
 Protect tendons from excessive stress.  
 Enhance precision and strength in feline movement.

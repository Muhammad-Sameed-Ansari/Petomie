#Metatarsals#

##Location##
Located between the tarsal bones (hock) and the phalanges (toes).  
Form the midsection of the hind paw and support the digits.

###Parts###
1. **Metatarsal Bones I–V** – Five elongated bones forming the base of the paw.  
   - **Metatarsal I**: Shortest and supports the first (inner) toe.  
   - **Metatarsals II–V**: Longer and support the four main toes used for walking and balance.  
   Each articulates proximally with the tarsal bones and distally with the phalanges.

2. **Proximal Articulations** – Joints between metatarsals and tarsals.  
   Allow flexibility and limited rotation for paw movement.

3. **Distal Articulations** – Joints connecting metatarsals with the proximal phalanges.  
   Transmit forces during walking and jumping.

##Function##
 Support the body during walking and jumping.  
 Transfer force from the hock to the digits.  
 Provide balance and stability to the paw.  
 Aid in fine motor control and shock absorption.

#Femur#

##Location##
Located in the upper hindlimb, between the pelvis and the tibia.  
The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the cat’s body, forming the thigh region.  
It articulates proximally with the pelvis at the hip joint and distally with the tibia and patella at the stifle joint.

###Parts###
1. **Head** – Rounded upper portion that fits into the acetabulum of the pelvis.  
   Forms the ball-and-socket hip joint, allowing multidirectional movement.  
   Connected to the shaft by a narrow **neck**.

2. **Greater Trochanter** – Large lateral projection near the head.  
   Serves as the attachment site for gluteal muscles responsible for hindlimb extension and abduction.

3. **Lesser Trochanter** – Small medial projection below the neck.  
   Provides attachment for iliopsoas muscles that flex the hip.

4. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, slightly curved central portion of the bone.  
   Provides strength, supports muscle attachment, and transmits forces during motion.

5. **Medial and Lateral Condyles** – Rounded distal prominences that articulate with the tibia.  
   Form the stifle joint and allow flexion and extension of the hindlimb.

6. **Trochlea of Femur** – Smooth groove between the condyles on the cranial surface.  
   Guides the patella and ensures stable movement during limb extension.

##Function##
 Forms the structural foundation of the thigh.  
 Supports major muscles involved in locomotion.  
 Transfers weight from the pelvis to the lower limb.  
 Enables flexion, extension, and rotation of the hindlimb.  
 Provides leverage for jumping, running, and climbing.

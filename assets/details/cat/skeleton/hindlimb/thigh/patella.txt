#Patella#

##Location##
Located at the front of the stifle (knee) joint in the hindlimb.  
The patella is a small, triangular sesamoid bone embedded within the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle.  
It lies between the femur and tibia, protecting the joint and improving mechanical efficiency during limb movement.

###Parts###
1. **Base** – The broad, proximal surface of the patella.  
   Serves as the attachment site for the quadriceps tendon.  
   Transmits muscle force from the thigh to the lower leg.

2. **Apex** – The pointed distal end of the bone.  
   Connects to the patellar ligament, which attaches to the tibial tuberosity.  
   Facilitates extension of the hindlimb.

3. **Articular Surface** – Smooth posterior surface that glides over the trochlea of the femur.  
   Covered with articular cartilage to reduce friction during movement.

4. **Anterior Surface** – Rough outer surface providing tendon attachment and protection to the stifle joint.  
   Palpable under the skin when the limb is flexed.

##Function##
 Protects the stifle joint and reduces friction during movement.  
 Acts as a fulcrum to increase the leverage of the quadriceps muscle.  
 Assists in extension of the hindlimb.  
 Provides stability to the stifle and improves efficiency of motion.

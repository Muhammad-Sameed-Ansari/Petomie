#Fibula#

##Location##
Located along the lateral side of the tibia in the cat’s lower hindlimb.  
The fibula is a slender, elongated bone that runs parallel to the tibia from the stifle to the hock.  
Unlike in horses, the cat’s fibula remains complete and separate, allowing greater flexibility and rotation of the limb.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal End (Head of Fibula)** – Upper section articulating with the lateral condyle of the tibia.  
   Provides attachment for ligaments and muscles stabilizing the stifle joint.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – Long and thin central portion extending down the leg.  
   Lies parallel to the tibia and provides surface area for muscular and ligamentous attachment.  
   Aids in maintaining the shape and structure of the lower limb.

3. **Distal End (Lateral Malleolus)** – Lower end forming part of the hock joint.  
   Articulates with the talus and calcaneus, stabilizing the lateral aspect of the hock.  
   Serves as an attachment site for tendons of the peroneal muscles.

##Function##
 Provides lateral support and stability to the lower hindlimb.  
 Serves as an attachment site for muscles and ligaments controlling hock movement.  
 Works in coordination with the tibia to maintain balance and precision during locomotion.  
 Enhances flexibility for agile movement, climbing, and rapid directional changes.

#Tibia#

##Location##
Located in the lower hindlimb between the stifle (knee) and hock joints.  
The tibia is the main weight-bearing bone of the cat’s leg, forming the shin region and providing stability and strength during walking, running, and jumping.

###Parts###
1. **Proximal End** – Broad upper section articulating with the femur to form the stifle joint.  
   Features:  
   - **Medial and Lateral Condyles**: Smooth surfaces articulating with the femoral condyles.  
   - **Intercondylar Eminence**: Central ridge for attachment of cruciate ligaments.  
   - **Tibial Tuberosity**: Prominent projection for attachment of the patellar ligament.

2. **Body (Shaft)** – Long, slightly triangular shaft extending down the leg.  
   Provides attachment for muscles controlling movement of the hock and digits.  
   Includes a sharp **tibial crest** on the anterior surface, visible under the skin.

3. **Distal End** – Narrow lower end forming part of the hock joint.  
   Articulates with the talus (tibial tarsal bone) to form the main hinge joint of the hock.  
   Contains the **medial malleolus**, which provides stability to the hock.

##Function##
 Bears the cat’s weight and transmits it from the femur to the hock.  
 Serves as the main structural support of the lower leg.  
 Provides attachment for major flexor and extensor muscles.  
 Enables agile and powerful hindlimb motion during running, climbing, and jumping.

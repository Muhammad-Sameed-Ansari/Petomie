#Talus#

##Location##
Located at the top of the hock joint in the cat’s hindlimb, between the tibia above and the central tarsal bone below.  
The talus, also known as the tibial tarsal bone, forms the main hinge joint of the hock and supports the transmission of body weight from the leg to the paw.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – The central mass of the bone.  
   Articulates proximally with the tibia and distally with the central tarsal bone.  
   Serves as a stabilizing structure that transmits weight during motion.

2. **Trochlea of Talus** – The prominent, pulley-like ridge on the dorsal surface.  
   Fits into the tibial cochlea to form the primary hinge motion of the hock.  
   Ensures controlled flexion and extension and prevents lateral displacement.

3. **Head** – The rounded anterior portion.  
   Articulates with the central tarsal bone to form part of the proximal intertarsal joint.  
   Allows smooth transfer of movement between upper and lower tarsal bones.

4. **Neck** – The narrow region connecting the head and body.  
   Provides ligament attachment points and flexibility between articular surfaces.

5. **Articular Facets** – Smooth surfaces on the sides and underside of the talus.  
   Articulate with the calcaneus and adjacent tarsal bones.  
   Distribute weight and pressure evenly across the joint during movement.

##Function##
 Forms the main hinge joint of the hock.  
 Allows controlled flexion and extension of the hindlimb.  
 Transmits weight from the tibia to the tarsus.  
 Provides stability and coordination during motion.  
 Assists in balance and propulsion when running or climbing.

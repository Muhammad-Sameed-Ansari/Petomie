#Tarsals#

##Location##
Located in the hock region of the cat’s hindlimb, between the tibia and fibula above and the metatarsal bones below.  
The tarsals form a compact group of small bones that make up the ankle joint and allow flexibility and stability during movement.

###Parts###
1. **Talus (Tibial Tarsal Bone)** – Situated on the top of the tarsus, articulating with the tibia.  
   Forms the main hinge joint of the hock and allows flexion and extension.  
   Transmits weight from the leg to the paw.

2. **Calcaneus (Fibular Tarsal Bone)** – Forms the heel and point of the hock.  
   Provides leverage for powerful muscles and attachment for the Achilles tendon.  
   Serves as a major structure for propulsion and jumping.

3. **Central Tarsal Bone** – Located between the talus above and the tarsal bones below.  
   Acts as the stabilizing link between upper and lower tarsal rows.  
   Distributes weight evenly through the foot.

4. **First, Second, Third, and Fourth Tarsal Bones** – Small cuboidal bones forming the distal row.  
   Articulate with the central tarsal bone above and the metatarsal bones below.  
   Contribute to balance, weight distribution, and flexibility in the paw.

##Function##
 Form the structure of the hock joint.  
 Provide articulation between the leg and the foot.  
 Allow flexion, extension, and limited rotation during movement.  
 Support body weight and absorb shock during walking, running, and jumping.  
 Contribute to the cat’s agility and ability to climb and land softly.

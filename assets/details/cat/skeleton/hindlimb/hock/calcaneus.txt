#Calcaneus#

##Location##
Located at the back of the hock joint in the hindlimb.  
The calcaneus, also known as the heel bone, forms the most prominent part of the tarsus.  
It lies caudal to the talus and provides leverage and attachment for powerful hindlimb muscles.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – The main elongated portion forming the heel.  
   Provides attachment for the gastrocnemius tendon (Achilles tendon).  
   Acts as a lever arm during limb extension and propulsion.

2. **Calcaneal Tuberosity** – Large projection at the proximal end of the bone.  
   Forms the visible point of the hock.  
   Serves as the primary attachment site for the Achilles tendon and superficial digital flexor tendon.

3. **Articular Facets** – Smooth surfaces that articulate with the talus and fibula.  
   Allow smooth gliding and stability during flexion and extension of the hock.

4. **Sustentaculum Tali** – Medial projection supporting the talus and guiding tendons.  
   Provides a surface over which the deep digital flexor tendon passes.  
   Aids in maintaining alignment and coordination within the hock.

##Function##
 Forms the lever system of the hock, enabling propulsion and jumping.  
 Provides attachment for tendons that extend the hindlimb.  
 Transmits muscular force during running and climbing.  
 Acts as a stabilizing structure and shock absorber in the tarsal region.

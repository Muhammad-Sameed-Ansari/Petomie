#Central Tarsal Bone#

##Location##
Located in the midsection of the tarsus (hock) between the talus and the distal row of tarsal bones.  
In the cat, this bone forms the central connection between the upper and lower tarsal rows, contributing to flexibility and stability of the hindlimb.

###Parts###
1. **Dorsal Surface** – Articulates with the talus (tibial tarsal bone) above.  
   Forms part of the proximal intertarsal joint.  
   Supports limited flexion and extension during hock movement.

2. **Plantar Surface** – Articulates with the second and third tarsal bones below.  
   Helps distribute weight evenly through the tarsal arch.  
   Provides attachment points for short ligaments that stabilize the joint.

3. **Medial and Lateral Facets** – Smooth articular areas connecting to adjacent tarsal bones.  
   Maintain alignment and prevent rotation within the joint.

##Function##
 Acts as a central stabilizing bone of the hock.  
 Distributes pressure from the upper to the lower tarsal row.  
 Allows smooth transfer of force during locomotion.  
 Enhances joint flexibility and shock absorption during walking and jumping.

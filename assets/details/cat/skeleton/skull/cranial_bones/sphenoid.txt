#Sphenoid Bone#

##Location##
Complex bone at the base of the skull between the occipital and ethmoid bones.  
Forms a central part of the cranial floor.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – Central section forming part of the cranial base; may contain sphenoid sinus.  
   Supports the brain above.

2. **Greater Wings** – Extend laterally to form part of the skull wall.  
   Contain foramina for cranial nerves and vessels.

3. **Pterygoid Processes** – Descend ventrally; attachment for pterygoid muscles.  
   Involved in jaw movement mechanics.

4. **Optic Canal** – Passage for the optic nerve from the brain to the orbit.  
   Critical for vision pathways.

##Function##
 Supports basal brain structures and transmits cranial nerves.  
 Provides muscle attachment for jaw and palate function.  
 Contributes to cranial stability and orbital boundaries.

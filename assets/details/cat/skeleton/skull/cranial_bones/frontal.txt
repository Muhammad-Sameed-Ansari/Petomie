#Frontal Bone#

##Location##
Located at the anterior portion of the skull, forming the forehead and the roof of the orbits.  
Borders the nasal bones rostrally and the parietal bones caudally; contributes to the cranial cavity roof.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – Broad plate forming the forehead and orbital roof.  
   Protects the frontal lobes and shapes the brow region.

2. **Frontal Sinuses** – Small air cavities within the frontal bone.  
   Reduce skull weight and assist in sound resonance.

3. **Orbital Margin** – Superior rim of the eye socket.  
   Protects the eye and provides attachment for periocular structures.

##Function##
 Forms the skull roof anteriorly and protects the brain and eyes.  
 Houses the frontal sinus to lighten the skull.  
 Contributes to facial contour and orbital stability.

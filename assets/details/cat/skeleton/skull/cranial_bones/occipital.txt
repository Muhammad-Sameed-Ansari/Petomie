#Occipital Bone#

##Location##
Forms the caudal and basal portion of the skull.  
Articulates with the atlas at the atlanto-occipital joint.

###Parts###
1. **Foramen Magnum** – Large opening permitting the spinal cord to exit the skull.  
   Connects brain to spinal canal.

2. **Occipital Condyles** – Paired, smooth articular surfaces on either side of the foramen magnum.  
   Enable nodding motion with the atlas.

3. **Nuchal Crest** – Caudal ridge for attachment of nuchal and neck muscles.  
   Provides leverage for head posture.

4. **Basilar Part** – Ventral plate extending toward the sphenoid.  
   Supports brainstem structures and forms part of the cranial base.

##Function##
 Protects the hindbrain and forms the posterior skull base.  
 Provides articulation with the first cervical vertebra.  
 Serves as a strong attachment site for neck musculature.  
 Supports head movement and posture.

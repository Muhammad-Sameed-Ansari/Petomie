#Ethmoid Bone#

##Location##
Situated between the nasal cavity and anterior cranial fossa, forming part of the cranial floor and nasal septum.  
Lies rostral to the sphenoid and caudal to the nasal bones.

###Parts###
1. **Cribriform Plate** – Sieve-like plate separating nasal cavity from cranial cavity.  
   Allows olfactory nerve fibers to pass to the olfactory bulbs.

2. **Perpendicular Plate** – Vertical plate forming part of the nasal septum.  
   Divides the nasal cavity into left and right halves.

3. **Ethmoidal Labyrinth** – Series of delicate air cells (ethmoidal sinuses).  
   Lined by mucosa that conditions inspired air.

##Function##
 Supports olfaction by transmitting olfactory nerves.  
 Forms part of the nasal septum and cranial base.  
 Aids airflow conditioning and reduces skull weight through sinus spaces.

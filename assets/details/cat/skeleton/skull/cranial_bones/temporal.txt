#Temporal Bone#

##Location##
Located on each side of the skull below the parietal bones and posterior to the zygomatic bone.  
Forms part of the skull base and lateral wall.

###Parts###
1. **Squamous Part** – Flat lateral plate forming the cranial wall.  
   Contributes to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

2. **Tympanic Part** – Surrounds the external acoustic meatus.  
   Forms the bony external ear canal and supports middle ear structures.

3. **Petrous Part** – Dense, pyramid-shaped portion housing the inner ear (cochlea, vestibular apparatus).  
   Critical for hearing and balance.

4. **Zygomatic Process** – Joins the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch.  
   Provides origin for the masseter muscle.

##Function##
 Protects and houses auditory and vestibular organs.  
 Forms the TMJ for jaw motion.  
 Provides attachment for chewing and neck muscles.  
 Contributes to cranial base strength.

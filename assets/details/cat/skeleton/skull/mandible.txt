#Mandible#

##Location##
Forms the lower jaw of the cat and lies ventral to the skull. It articulates with the temporal bones at the temporomandibular joints on either side of the head.

##Shape##
A single, U-shaped bone in adults (fused at the mandibular symphysis) composed of two main regions: the horizontal body and the vertical ramus. The body contains alveoli for the lower teeth — incisors (I), canine (C), premolars (P), and molars (M).

##Function##
Houses the lower teeth and provides attachment for the muscles of mastication.
Forms the movable part of the jaw essential for biting, chewing, and grooming.
Articulates with the temporal bones to allow jaw motion.
Supports facial structure and contributes to vocal and feeding behaviors.

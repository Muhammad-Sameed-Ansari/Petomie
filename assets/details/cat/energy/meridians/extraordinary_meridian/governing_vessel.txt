#Governing Vessel (Du Mai)#

##Location##
Begins at the perineum, between the anus and the base of the tail (GV-1).
Ascends along the midline of the body over the tail and up the spine, running over the dorsal midline from the sacrum to the neck.
Continues over the top of the head, across the poll, and down the forehead to the upper lip.

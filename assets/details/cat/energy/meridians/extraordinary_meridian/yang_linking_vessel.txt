#Yang Linking Vessel (Yang Wei Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are special channels in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** that act as reservoirs of Qi and Blood.  
They regulate, store, and distribute energy throughout the body, maintaining harmony between the twelve Primary Meridians.  
Unlike the main meridians, they do not correspond to a specific organ but rather balance the entire energetic network.  
In cats, they represent deep instinctive wisdom, energetic protection, and alignment between spirit and body.  

The **Yang Linking Vessel** governs **external harmony, adaptation, and resilience**.  
It links the Yang meridians together, coordinating the body’s outer energy and response to external changes.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the outer foot, ascends along the side of the body, over the shoulder and neck, and reaches the head.  
This flow connects all Yang meridians, maintaining alertness and external awareness.  

###Function###  
Physically, it influences the nervous system, circulation, and muscles of the back and neck.  
Energetically, it helps the cat adapt to external environments and stressors.  
It provides endurance, balance, and the ability to stay centered in dynamic situations.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Neck or back tension, fatigue, or poor adaptability.  
Energetic disharmony such as overstimulation or burnout.  
Emotional signs include irritability, impatience, or difficulty adjusting to change.

#Girdling Vessel (Dai Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are special channels in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** that act as reservoirs of Qi and Blood.  
They regulate, store, and distribute energy throughout the body, maintaining harmony between the twelve Primary Meridians.  
Unlike the main meridians, they do not correspond to a specific organ but rather balance the entire energetic network.  
In cats, they represent deep instinctive wisdom, energetic protection, and alignment between spirit and body.  

The **Girdling Vessel (Dai Mai)** governs **balance, coordination, and energetic containment**.  
It is the only horizontal meridian, encircling the body like a belt, maintaining structural integrity and harmony.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Encircles the waist, connecting the front and back meridians, uniting upper and lower body energy.  
This circular flow stabilizes the spine, abdomen, and hips.  

###Function###  
Physically, it supports the abdominal muscles, spine, and hips.  
It maintains posture and alignment.  
Energetically, it harmonizes the flow between Yin and Yang meridians, preventing energy from scattering.  
It helps the cat stay centered and grounded in motion.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak back, abdominal tension, or imbalance between upper and lower body.  
Energetic disharmony such as feeling “ungrounded” or unstable.  
Emotional signs include restlessness, scattered focus, or emotional leakage.

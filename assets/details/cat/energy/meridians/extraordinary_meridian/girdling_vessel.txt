#Girdling Vessel (Dai Mai)#

##Location##
Encircles the body horizontally at the level of the second lumbar vertebra.
Originates near the lateral aspect of the ribcage close to the free end of the 13th rib (Dai Mai region).
Wraps around the waist and abdomen like a belt, connecting the front and back of the body.
Intersects with the Gall Bladder Meridian and interacts with the Liver, Kidney, and Spleen meridians.

##Shape##
A unique horizontal meridian — the only one that encircles the body rather than running lengthwise.
It acts like an energetic “belt,” stabilizing and integrating the vertical meridians and maintaining postural and energetic balance.

##Function##
Binds and harmonizes the vertical flow of energy in the body
Supports coordination between upper and lower body
Regulates abdominal organs and reproductive function
Helps maintain spinal alignment and core stability
Balances emotional boundaries and centered awareness

##Signs of Imbalance##
Tension or stiffness around the midsection
Weakness in the back or abdomen
Digestive sluggishness or bloating
Reproductive or urinary disturbances
Emotional instability or feeling “disconnected” from one’s center

#Yin Linking Vessel (Yin Wei Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are special channels in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** that act as reservoirs of Qi and Blood.  
They regulate, store, and distribute energy throughout the body, maintaining harmony between the twelve Primary Meridians.  
Unlike the main meridians, they do not correspond to a specific organ but rather balance the entire energetic network.  
In cats, they represent deep instinctive wisdom, energetic protection, and alignment between spirit and body.  

The **Yin Linking Vessel** governs **emotional harmony, connection, and inner peace**.  
It links the Yin meridians together, harmonizing the heart, chest, and abdomen.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the inner leg, travels upward through the abdomen and chest, and ends near the throat.

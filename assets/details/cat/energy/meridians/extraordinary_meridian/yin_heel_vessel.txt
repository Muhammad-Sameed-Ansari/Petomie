#Yin Motility Vessel (Yin Qiao Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are special channels in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** that act as reservoirs of Qi and Blood.  
They regulate, store, and distribute energy throughout the body, maintaining harmony between the twelve Primary Meridians.  
Unlike the main meridians, they do not correspond to a specific organ but rather balance the entire energetic network.  
In cats, they represent deep instinctive wisdom, energetic protection, and alignment between spirit and body.  

The **Yin Motility Vessel** governs **receptivity, inner balance, and stillness**.  
It regulates the movement and coordination of Yin energy, controlling rest, relaxation, and introspection.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner side of the hind paw, ascends along the inner leg, passes through the chest and throat, and ends near the inner corner of the eye.  
This ascending path reflects awakening and awareness from deep rest to emotional perception.  

###Function###

It regulates the lower abdomen and reproductive area.  
Energetically, it balances calmness, presence, and intuition, supporting inward reflection and emotional sensitivity.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Sleep disturbances, stiffness, or weakness in the inner limbs.

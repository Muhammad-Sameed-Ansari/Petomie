#Yin–Yang Balance#

##Location##
Present in every cell, organ, and energy pathway of the cat’s body.
Yin and Yang form the two complementary forces that govern all biological and emotional functions:
###Yin###
The quiet, cooling, nourishing, and receptive energy.
###Yang###
The warm, dynamic, outward, and protective energy.
In cats, Yin is reflected in rest, tissue nourishment, and inner calm, while Yang appears in movement, alertness, and responsiveness.

##Shape##
Not a physical structure, but a flowing polarity within all systems:
Organs: Kidney (Yin) balances Bladder (Yang), Heart (Yin) balances Small Intestine (Yang), and so forth.
Meridians: Each Yin meridian pairs with a Yang meridian, linking inner and outer surfaces of the body.
Behavioral expression:
Yin qualities show in the cat’s serenity, rest, and warmth-seeking posture.
Yang qualities appear through playfulness, hunting, vocalizing, and exploration.
Both are constantly shifting, like breathing in and out — rest (Yin) gives rise to motion (Yang), and motion returns to rest.

##Function##
Maintains vital balance between stillness and activity, body heat and cooling, digestion and elimination, alertness and sleep.
Regulates nervous system tone, circulation, and energy distribution throughout the meridians.
When Yin is deficient, the cat may show signs like heat-seeking, irritability, dry coat, or restlessness.
When Yang is deficient, symptoms may include lethargy, cold paws, poor appetite, or low vitality.
True wellness occurs when Yin and Yang transform harmoniously, allowing the cat to stay graceful, agile, and emotionally balanced in every environment.

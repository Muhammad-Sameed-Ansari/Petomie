#Penetrating Vessel (Chong Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are special channels in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)** that act as reservoirs of Qi and Blood.  
They regulate, store, and distribute energy throughout the body, maintaining harmony between the twelve Primary Meridians.  
Unlike the main meridians, they do not correspond to a specific organ but rather balance the entire energetic network.  
In cats, they represent deep instinctive wisdom, energetic protection, and alignment between spirit and body.  

The **Penetrating Vessel (Chong Mai)** governs **core vitality, blood flow, and emotional depth**.  
It is often referred to as the “Sea of Blood” or “Sea of the Twelve Meridians,” connecting all energy pathways to the center of life force.

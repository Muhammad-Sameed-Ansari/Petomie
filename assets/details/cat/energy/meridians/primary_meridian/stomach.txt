#Stomach Meridian (Wei Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the cat’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In cats, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** such as intuition, awareness, and emotional grace.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the cat to move with natural elegance and instinctive precision.  

The **Stomach Meridian** governs **nourishment, appetite, and stability**.  
It represents the ability to digest both food and experiences calmly and completely.

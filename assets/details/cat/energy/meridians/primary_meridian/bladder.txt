#Bladder Meridian#

##Location##
Begins at the inner corner of the eye (BL-1), ascends over the forehead and top of the head, and travels along both sides of the spine.
It runs over the neck, withers, and back in two parallel lines:

Inner Bladder Line: close to the spine, containing the Back-Shu points that connect to internal organs.

Outer Bladder Line: slightly lateral, following the muscular ridge along the back and flank.
Continues over the sacrum and croup, descending through the gluteal region and between the hamstring muscles.
Passes behind the stifle and down the caudolateral side of the hind limb, ending at the lateral corner of the hind paw’s fifth digit (BL-67).

##Shape##
A long, dual meridian running from head to tail and down the hind legs.
Forms two energy “highways” along the back—one for internal organ connection, one for muscular and emotional release.

##Function##
Regulates urinary and nervous system balance
Supports detoxification and elimination through urine and sweat
Connects to all internal organs via the Back-Shu points
Releases tension along the spine and hindquarters
Influences fear, courage, and the ability to relax and let go

##Signs of Imbalance##
Tightness or pain along the back or hindquarters
Frequent urination or urinary retention
Nervousness, anxiety, or startle response
Weakness in the hind limbs
Eye irritation or tension over the poll

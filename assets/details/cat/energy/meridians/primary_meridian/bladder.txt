#Bladder Meridian (Pang Guang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the cat’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In cats, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** such as intuition, awareness, and emotional grace.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the cat to move with natural elegance and instinctive precision.  

The **Bladder Meridian** governs **fluid regulation, release, and energy flow along the spine**.  
It represents the ability to balance action and rest, control, and surrender.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner corner of the eye, runs over the head, down along both sides of the spine, over the hips, and continues down the back of the hind limb to end at the outer tip of the hind paw.  
This long, descending pathway mirrors the flow of Qi through the body’s core, releasing tension and supporting grounding.  

###Function###  
Physically, it manages urination, fluid balance, and energy circulation along the spine and nervous system.  
It influences the kidneys and the sympathetic nervous system.  
Energetically, it governs boundaries, strength, and the release of stored emotions or stress.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Urinary issues, back stiffness, or tension along the spine.  
Energetic disharmony such as fear or inability to let go.  
Emotional signs include defensiveness, rigidity, or stress accumulation.

#Heart Meridian (Xin Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the cat’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In cats, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** such as intuition, awareness, and emotional grace.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the cat to move with natural elegance and instinctive precision.  

The **Heart Meridian** governs **circulation, consciousness, and emotional warmth**.  
It represents the center of love, awareness, and spiritual connection.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Starts deep within the heart, emerges at the armpit, travels down along the inner side of the forelimb, and ends at the tip of the front paw.  
This pathway symbolizes the flow of warmth and joy from the heart to expression through action and touch.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates the heartbeat, blood flow, and emotional stability.  
It supports restful sleep and balanced nervous function.  
Energetically, it governs joy, love, and connection, helping the cat remain centered and emotionally open.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Rapid heartbeat, restlessness, or sleep disturbance.  
Energetic disharmony such as agitation, anxiety, or emotional detachment.

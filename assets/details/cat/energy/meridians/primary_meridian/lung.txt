Begins deep within the chest, connecting internally with the lungs and throat before emerging on the lateral chest wall at the first intercostal space (LU-1).
From there, it travels over the shoulder and down along the medial side of the forelimb, following the groove between the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles.
It continues distally along the craniomedial surface of the forearm, passes the medial side of the carpus, and ends at the medial corner of the front paw at the first digit (LU-11).

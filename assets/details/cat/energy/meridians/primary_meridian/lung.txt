#Lung Meridian (Fei Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the cat’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In cats, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** such as intuition, awareness, and emotional grace.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the cat to move with natural elegance and instinctive precision.  

The **Lung Meridian** governs **breathing, vitality, and emotional openness**.  
It represents the ability to receive life, inspiration, and connection with the world.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins in the upper chest near the lungs, moves up to the throat, travels down the front of the forelimb, and ends at the inner side of the front paw.  
This downward flow reflects the release of breath and letting go of tension or grief.

It influences the skin, coat quality, and body fluids.  
Energetically, it encourages self-expression, emotional clarity, and the capacity to embrace life with trust and calm presence.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Coughing, nasal discharge, shallow breathing, or dry coat.  
Energetic disharmony such as sadness, grief, or resistance to change.

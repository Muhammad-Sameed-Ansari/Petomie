#Gallbladder Meridian (Dan Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the cat’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In cats, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** such as intuition, awareness, and emotional grace.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the cat to move with natural elegance and instinctive precision.  

The **Gallbladder Meridian** governs **decision-making, direction, and courage in action**.  
It represents clarity, initiative, and the ability to take aligned movement.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the outer corner of the eye, curves around the ear, travels down the side of the body, along the ribs, hip, and outer hind limb, and ends at the outer tip of the hind paw.

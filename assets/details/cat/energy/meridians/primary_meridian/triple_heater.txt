#Triple Heater Meridian#

##Location##
Begins on the lateral side of the fourth digit of the front paw (TH-1).
Ascends along the dorsolateral aspect of the forelimb, crossing over the carpus and continuing along the lateral side of the radius and ulna.
Passes the lateral elbow and shoulder region, traveling up the side of the neck behind the ear.
Curves around the ear base and ends at the outer corner of the eye (TH-23).
Internally, it connects with the pericardium and the three body cavities (upper, middle, and lower burners) responsible for fluid metabolism and temperature regulation.

A lateral meridian running from the outer front digit up the forelimb to the side of the head.
Links the body’s functional zones—chest, abdomen, and pelvis—coordinating communication between organs.

##Function##
Regulates body temperature and water metabolism
Coordinates energy flow between upper (respiration), middle (digestion), and lower (elimination) burners

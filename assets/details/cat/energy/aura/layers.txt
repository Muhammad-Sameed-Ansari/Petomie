#Aura Layers#

###Location###
Surround the cat in several concentric layers of subtle energy, each extending outward from the fur and body.
These layers communicate physical condition, emotional flow, mental clarity, and spiritual awareness.

###Shape###
Oval, close-fitting, and highly responsive to emotional and environmental changes.
Each layer vibrates with its own purpose:

Etheric Layer: Closest to the fur, mirroring muscles, organs, and physical vitality.
Emotional Layer: Holds moods, emotional memories, and daily sensory reactions.
Mental Layer: Relates to thought patterns, behavior responses, and perceptual processing.
Spiritual Layer: The outermost, subtle layer connecting the cat to intuition, higher awareness, and universal energy.

When balanced, these layers are clear, smooth, and gently interwoven.

###Function###

##Etheric Layer##
Mirrors physical structure and life force,
Reflects early signs of stress, fatigue, or illness,
Supports coordination, balance, and bodily comfort,
Weakness may show as lethargy, stiffness, or lowered immunity.

##Emotional Layer##
Holds emotional states, memories, and reactions,
Shifts with daily experiences, stress, or comfort,
Bright and fluid when the cat feels safe,
Dense or cloudy during fear, grief, or overstimulation.

##Mental Layer##
Carries patterns of perception, learned behaviors, and reactions,
Supports understanding, environmental processing, and mental clarity,
Balanced when the cat shows curiosity, adaptability, and focus,
Distortion may cause confusion, reactivity, or unpredictable behavior.

##Spiritual Layer##
The most expansive and subtle,
Connects the cat to intuition, energetic awareness, and universal consciousness,
Radiates peace, inner clarity, and soulful presence,
Weakness may appear as disconnection, shutdown, or lack of vitality.

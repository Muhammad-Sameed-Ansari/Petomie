#Aura Magnitude#

###Location###
Surrounds the entire cat, radiating outward from the skin and fur in a sensitive, responsive energy field.
Because cats are highly intuitive and energetically perceptive, their aura expands and contracts quickly depending on mood, environment, and sensory input.
The aura is often strongest around the whiskers, muzzle, spine, and tail.

###Shape###
Oval and fluid, gently shifting with the cat’s movements.
The aura tends to be compact during alertness or overstimulation, and expands when the cat feels relaxed, safe, or emotionally open.

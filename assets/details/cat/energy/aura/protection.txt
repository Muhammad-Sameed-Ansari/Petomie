#Aura Protection#

###Location###
Forms the outermost shield of the cat’s energetic field, surrounding all other layers.
It is strongest around the face, whiskers, chest, and tail — the cat’s primary sensory and communication zones.

###Shape###
A thin, responsive protective shell that strengthens during alertness, travel, or unfamiliar environments.
When the cat feels safe, it softens and becomes more permeable.

###Meaning & Function###
The protective layer filters external energies before they reach deeper layers.

Functions include:
Shielding from chaotic or overwhelming environments
Preventing emotional or energetic drain
Supporting personal boundaries
Maintaining sensory balance
Helping the cat feel safe, settled, and secure

Cats rely on this layer heavily due to their fine sensory perception and strong intuitive awareness.

###Signs of Weak Aura Protection###
Over-sensitivity to sound, movement, or people
Avoidance or hiding
Over-grooming from stress
Clinginess or separation anxiety
Sudden reactivity or defensiveness

###Balancing Activities###
Stable routines
Quiet spaces for retreat
Energetic sealing practices
Soft lighting and gentle sounds
Respectful, non-forceful interaction

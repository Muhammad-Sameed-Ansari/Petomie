#Trigeminal Nerve (V)#

The cat’s trigeminal nerve is responsible for facial sensation and chewing movements.  
It also innervates the whiskers, allowing detection of air currents and nearby objects.  
Energetically, it represents awareness, boundaries, and sensory communication.

###Location###
Arises from the pons and divides into three main branches that cover the entire face.

###Parts###
Ophthalmic branch – senses around the eyes and forehead.  
Maxillary branch – senses whiskers, nose, and upper lip.  
Mandibular branch – controls jaw muscles and lower face.

###Function###
Provides facial sensitivity, whisker awareness, and chewing motion.  
Energetically, it connects feeling, communication, and grounded perception of the environment.

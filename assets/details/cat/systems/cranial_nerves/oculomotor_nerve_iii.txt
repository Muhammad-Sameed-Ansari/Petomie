#Oculomotor Nerve (III)#

The cat’s oculomotor nerve coordinates most eye movements, controlling focus and light adjustment.  
It allows precise tracking and depth focus during hunting or play.  
Energetically, it represents direction, alignment, and clarity of focus.

###Location###
Arises in the midbrain and runs forward to the eye socket, supplying most external eye muscles and the iris sphincter.

###Parts###
Superior branch – lifts the eyelid and moves the eye upward.  
Inferior branch – moves the eye inward and downward.  
Ciliary fibers – control lens focus and pupil contraction.

###Function###
Regulates eye motion and pupil size for light adaptation.  
Energetically, it governs clear attention and conscious direction of energy.

#Ovaries#

##Location##
Located within the **abdominal cavity**, near the **kidneys**, one on each side of the cat’s body.  
They are attached to the **broad ligament** of the uterus and connected to the **uterine tubes (oviducts)**.

###Shape###
**Small, oval-shaped organs** with a smooth surface.  
Their size and texture change slightly depending on the cat’s **reproductive cycle** and hormonal activity.

##Parts##

###1. Follicles###
Fluid-filled sacs where **ova (eggs)** develop.  
Multiple follicles may mature during each heat cycle due to the cat’s **induced ovulation** nature.

###2. Corpus Luteum###
A **temporary glandular structure** that forms after ovulation and secretes **progesterone** to maintain pregnancy or pseudopregnancy.

###3. Ovarian Stroma###
The connective tissue network that supports blood vessels, follicles, and developing eggs within the ovary.

###4. Ovarian Bursa###
A **membranous sac** surrounding each ovary, helping guide eggs into the uterine tubes after ovulation.

###Function###
Produce and release **ova (eggs)** for fertilization.  
Secrete **hormones** including estrogen and progesterone that regulate the **estrous cycle** and influence mating behavior.  
Coordinate with the **pituitary gland** and **hypothalamus** to control reproductive cycles.  
Play a key role in the cat’s **seasonally polyestrous** reproductive pattern, with cycles increasing in spring and summer.

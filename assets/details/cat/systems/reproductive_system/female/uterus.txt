#Uterus#

##Location##
Located within the **pelvic cavity**, extending slightly into the **abdominal cavity**.  
It lies between the **urinary bladder** (below) and the **colon** (above).  
The uterus connects to the **uterine tubes (oviducts)** at its horns and continues caudally to the **cervix**.

###Shape###
A **Y-shaped, hollow, muscular organ** consisting of two long **uterine horns** and a short **uterine body**.  
The walls are flexible and expand greatly during pregnancy to accommodate developing kittens.

##Parts##

###1. Uterine Horns###
Two long, slender extensions where **embryo implantation** and **fetal development** occur.  
Their length allows for multiple embryos to implant along the horns.

###2. Uterine Body###
The **central section** where the horns merge, connecting directly to the cervix.  
It serves as the passageway during birth.

###3. Endometrium###
The **inner mucosal lining** that secretes nutrients and supports early embryo development.  
It thickens under the influence of progesterone during pregnancy.

###4. Myometrium###
The **muscular middle layer** that contracts strongly during labor to expel the kittens.

###5. Perimetrium###
The **outer protective membrane** providing structure and anchoring the uterus to surrounding tissues.

###Function###
Serves as the **site for embryo implantation** and **fetal growth**.  
Provides nourishment through **endometrial secretions** before the placenta forms.  
Expands significantly during pregnancy to carry multiple fetuses.  
Contracts during **parturition (birth)** to deliver the kittens.  
Returns to normal size after birth through **uterine involution**.  
Plays a vital role in the **estrous cycle**, responding to hormonal changes from the ovaries.

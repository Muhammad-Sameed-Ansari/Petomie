#Cervix#

##Location##
Located at the **junction between the uterus and the vagina**, forming the gateway between the **uterine body** and the **vaginal canal**.  
It is positioned within the **pelvic cavity** and functions as both a barrier and a passageway in the reproductive tract.

###Shape###
A **short, fibromuscular tube** with a narrow lumen.  
Its length is about 1–1.5 centimeters, and it has a **firm texture** that softens during estrus and parturition.

##Parts##

###1. External Os###
The **outer opening** of the cervix facing the vagina.  
It remains tightly closed except during estrus or birth.

###2. Cervical Canal###
The **central passageway** lined with mucous membrane and longitudinal folds.  
Produces secretions that change consistency based on hormonal cycles.

###3. Internal Os###
The **inner opening** connecting to the uterine body.  
Stays closed during pregnancy to protect developing fetuses.

###4. Cervical Folds###
Soft ridges of mucosal tissue that assist in forming a seal between the uterus and vagina.

###Function###
Acts as a **protective gateway** within the reproductive system.  
Prevents bacteria and debris from entering the uterus.  
Opens during **estrus** to allow sperm passage for fertilization.  
Relaxes and dilates during **parturition** to permit kitten delivery.  
Secretes **mucus** that maintains uterine health and supports sperm transport when the queen is in heat.

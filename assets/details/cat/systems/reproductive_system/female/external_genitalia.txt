#External Genitalia#

##Location##
Located beneath the **anus** at the rear of the cat’s body, forming the **external opening** of the female reproductive tract.  
These structures surround and protect the entrance to the **vagina** and **vestibule**.

###Shape###
A **vertical slit** formed by two soft folds of skin (labia) that meet tightly to maintain closure and hygiene.  
Their appearance may vary slightly based on the cat’s age, hormonal state, and reproductive history.

##Parts##

###1. Vulva###
The **outermost part** of the reproductive tract consisting of two **labia** that close to protect against contamination.  
It opens into the vestibule and changes slightly in appearance during estrus.

###2. Clitoris###
A small **sensitive organ** located at the floor of the vulva within a shallow depression (the clitoral fossa).  
It plays a role in sexual reflexes and stimulation.

###3. Vestibule###
A **shared passage** for the urinary and reproductive systems extending from the hymen to the vulva.  
It contains mucous glands that help maintain moisture and defense against pathogens.

###4. Dorsal and Ventral Commissures###
The **upper and lower junctions** where the labia meet, maintaining proper alignment and closure of the vulva.

###5. Perineum###
The **area between the vulva and anus** composed of skin and muscle that supports the pelvic floor and prevents contamination of the reproductive tract.

###Function###
Provides a **protective barrier** for the internal reproductive organs.  
Serves as the **entry point** for mating and the **exit** for birth.  
Allows for **urination** through the shared vestibule.  
Maintains a **clean, sealed opening** to prevent infection and preserve reproductive health.

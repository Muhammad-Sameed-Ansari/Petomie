#Mammary Glands (Female Cat)#

##Location##
Located along the ventral surface from the chest to the groin area. 
Cats typically have **four pairs** (eight total) of mammary glands arranged in two parallel rows extending from the thoracic to the inguinal regions. 
Each gland is embedded in the subcutaneous tissue and associated with a nipple (teat).

###Shape###
Flattened, lobular glands surrounded by connective and fatty tissue. 
Each gland contains ducts that converge toward the nipple for milk secretion during lactation. 
Size and texture change with hormonal cycles, pregnancy, and lactation.

##Parts##

###1. Thoracic Mammary Glands###
Located on the chest area near the forelimbs.

###2. Abdominal Mammary Glands###
Middle glands positioned along the belly region.

###3. Inguinal Mammary Glands###
Rear glands located in the groin area, usually the most active during nursing.

###4. Nipple (Teat)###
External projection through which milk is released; each contains multiple duct openings.

###5. Glandular Tissue###
Alveoli that produce milk under hormonal stimulation, mainly **prolactin** and **oxytocin**.

###6. Duct System###
Network of tubes that transport milk from alveoli to the nipple.

##Function##
Produces and secretes milk to feed kittens after birth.  
Provides antibodies (colostrum) to boost immunity in newborns.  
Responds to hormonal changes related to estrus, pregnancy, and lactation.  
Supports maternal bonding and behavior during nursing.

#Vagina#

##Location##
Located between the **cervix** and the **vulva**, forming the **terminal portion** of the cat’s reproductive tract.  
It lies within the **pelvic cavity**, extending from the cervix to the external genital opening.

###Shape###
A **short, muscular, and elastic tube** lined with mucous membrane.  
Its length averages 2–4 centimeters and allows expansion during mating and parturition.

##Parts##

The section closest to the **cervix**, forming a small recess that receives the cervix during copulation.

###2. Middle Vagina###
The **main portion** that serves as the site for **sperm deposition** during mating.

###3. Vestibule###
The **caudal continuation** of the vagina shared with the urinary tract.  
It connects the vaginal body to the vulva and contains openings for the urethra and mucous glands.

###4. Hymen###
A thin **mucosal fold** marking the transition between the vagina and the vestibule, usually faint or absent in mature queens.

###5. Vulva###
The **external opening** of the reproductive tract, forming the visible entrance to the vagina.

###Function###
Serves as the **copulatory organ** during mating.  
Acts as the **birth canal** during parturition.  
Allows **drainage of uterine secretions** and passage of urine.  
Protects internal structures through **mucous secretions** and its natural bacterial balance.  
Expands and contracts to accommodate reproductive and birthing processes.

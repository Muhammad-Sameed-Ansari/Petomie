#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

##Location##
Extend from each **ovary** to the **uterine horns** within the cat’s abdominal cavity.  
Each tube is suspended in the **broad ligament**, forming a narrow, curved pathway that connects the ovary to the uterus.

###Shape###
**Fine, coiled tubes** lined with ciliated epithelium.  
Each tube consists of three sections: the **infundibulum**, **ampulla**, and **isthmus**.

##Parts##

###1. Infundibulum###
The **funnel-shaped opening** near the ovary with small **fimbriae** that catch the released egg during ovulation.

###2. Ampulla###
The **wider, middle section** where **fertilization** typically occurs.  
The cilia and secretions help transport and nourish both sperm and egg.

###3. Isthmus###
The **narrow final portion** that connects the ampulla to the uterine horn.  
Smooth muscle contractions move the fertilized egg toward the uterus for implantation.

###Function###
Capture the **ovulated egg** from the ovary.  
Provide the **site for fertilization** between egg and sperm.  
Secrete fluids that **nourish** gametes and early embryos.  
Transport the **fertilized egg** into the uterus through gentle **muscular and ciliary movement**.  
Ensure proper timing for **embryo arrival** in the uterus for successful implantation.

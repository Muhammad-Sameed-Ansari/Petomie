#Placenta#

##Location##
Forms within the **uterus** during **pregnancy**, attaching to the uterine wall of the queen.  
It connects each developing kitten to the mother through the **umbilical cord**.

###Shape###
A **discoid (disk-shaped), vascular organ** that forms around each fetus.  
It consists of two layers: the **maternal portion** attached to the uterine lining and the **fetal portion** connected to the kitten via the umbilical cord.

##Parts##

###1. Maternal Portion###
Formed from the **uterine lining (endometrium)**.  
Contains blood sinuses that allow exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste between mother and fetus.

###2. Fetal Portion###
Develops from the **chorion and allantois** membranes.  
Contains fetal blood vessels that connect to the umbilical cord.

###3. Umbilical Cord###
The **connecting structure** between fetus and placenta.  
Carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste through blood vessels between the kitten and the mother.

###4. Placental Membranes###
Include the **chorion**, **allantois**, and **amnion**, which surround and protect the developing fetus.

###Function###
Acts as the **interface between mother and fetus**.  
Allows the **exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products** without mixing maternal and fetal blood.  
Produces essential **hormones** such as progesterone and relaxin to support pregnancy.  
Provides **immunological protection** for the developing fetus.  
Is expelled naturally after birth along with the **fetal membranes** (afterbirth).

#Epididymis#

##Location##
Lies along the **dorsal surface** of each testis within the scrotum.  
It connects the **seminiferous tubules** of the testis to the **sperm duct (vas deferens)**.

###Shape###
A **long, coiled tube** divided into three main sections: the **head**, **body**, and **tail**.  
It appears as a crescent-shaped structure closely attached to the testis.

##Parts##

###1. Head (Caput)###
Receives immature sperm from the testis through efferent ducts.

###2. Body (Corpus)###
The central section where sperm mature and gain motility.

###3. Tail (Cauda)###
Stores mature sperm until ejaculation, connecting directly to the sperm duct.

###Function###
Provides an environment for **sperm maturation** and **storage**.  
Transports sperm from the testis to the sperm duct during ejaculation.  
Reabsorbs excess testicular fluid and secretes proteins that support sperm development.

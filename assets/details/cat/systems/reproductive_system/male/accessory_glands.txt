#Accessory Glands#

##Location##
Located in the **pelvic cavity**, surrounding the **urethra** near its junction with the bladder.  
In male cats, these glands are small and less developed compared to other species.

###Shape###
Small **lobulated structures** composed of glandular tissue.  
They are not visible externally and lie close to the neck of the bladder.

##Parts##

###1. Prostate Gland###
The only significant accessory gland in cats.  
Encircles the urethra and secretes fluid that nourishes and protects sperm.

###2. Bulbourethral Glands###
Tiny paired glands located just behind the prostate.  
They secrete a small amount of lubricating fluid during mating.

###Function###
Produce **seminal fluids** that mix with sperm to form semen.  
Provide **nutrients and protection** for sperm survival.  
Lubricate the urethra during mating to aid sperm passage.  
Help **neutralize acidity** in the urethra for optimal sperm transport.

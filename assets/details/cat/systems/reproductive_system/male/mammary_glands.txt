#Mammary Glands (Male Cat)#

##Location##
Located along the **ventral surface** of the abdomen, extending from the chest to the groin.  
Male cats typically have **two to four pairs** of small, undeveloped mammary glands arranged symmetrically.

###Shape###
Flat, **nonfunctional structures** beneath the skin with small nipples.  
Covered by fine hair and connected to the surface by ducts that do not produce milk.

##Parts##

###1. Mammary Glands###
Composed mainly of connective and fatty tissue with minimal glandular elements.

###2. Nipples###
Small, round protrusions located on the ventral abdomen.  
Usually nonfunctional but may respond slightly to hormonal changes.

###3. Duct System###
Underdeveloped and inactive, with no milk production capability.

###Function###
No reproductive or lactational function.  
Remain hormonally inactive under normal testosterone levels.  
Occasionally respond to hormonal imbalance with slight enlargement.  
Serve as **homologous structures** to the female mammary glands, showing shared embryonic development.

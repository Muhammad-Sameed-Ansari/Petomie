#Testes#

##Location##
Located within the **scrotum**, a pouch of skin situated just below the anus and behind the penis.  
Each testis is suspended by the **spermatic cord**, which contains blood vessels, nerves, and the vas deferens.

###Shape###
**Oval-shaped organs** enclosed in a fibrous capsule called the **tunica albuginea**.  
The surface is smooth, and the internal structure is divided into lobules containing seminiferous tubules.

##Parts##

###1. Seminiferous Tubules###
Highly coiled tubes where **sperm production (spermatogenesis)** occurs.

###2. Interstitial Cells (Leydig Cells)###
Located between the seminiferous tubules, these cells produce **testosterone**.

###3. Tunica Albuginea###
A dense connective tissue capsule that surrounds and protects the testis.

###4. Mediastinum Testis###
A central connective structure through which blood vessels and ducts enter and leave the testis.

###Function###
Produce **sperm cells** for reproduction.  
Secrete **testosterone**, which regulates secondary sexual characteristics and libido.  
Maintain optimal conditions for sperm development within the **scrotum**, which keeps them slightly cooler than body temperature.

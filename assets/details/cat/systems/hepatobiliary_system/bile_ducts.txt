#Bile Ducts#
Part of the Hepatobiliary System: Supports detoxification, digestion, and energy balance.
Energetically, the ducts represent purification and letting go, maintaining free flow between cleansing and nourishment.

###Parts###

##Intrahepatic Ducts##
Small channels within the liver that collect bile from hepatocytes.  
Energetically, they represent internal flow and organization, directing movement within the system.

##Hepatic Ducts##
Merge into the common hepatic duct to carry bile out of the liver.  
Energetically, they symbolize communication and alignment, ensuring inner processes reach outward harmony.

##Common Bile Duct##
Extends toward the duodenum, combining with the pancreatic duct before entering the intestine.  
Energetically, it embodies release and transition, guiding detoxified energy into new cycles.

###Function###
The bile ducts transport bile from the liver into the duodenum.  
Bile aids in fat digestion, waste removal, and elimination of excess cholesterol.

###Common Imbalances###
Obstruction or inflammation: discomfort or poor digestion.  
Sluggish flow: fatigue or toxin buildup.  
Energetic blockage: resistance to release or holding onto the past.  
Energetic weakness: difficulty processing emotions or stagnation.  
Energetic overload: agitation or excessive cleansing drive.

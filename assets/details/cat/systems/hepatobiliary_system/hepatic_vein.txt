#Hepatic Veins#
Part of the Hepatobiliary System: Drain deoxygenated blood from the liver into the caudal vena cava.
Energetically, they represent release, completion, and restoration — allowing the system to renew through letting go.

###Parts###

##Right, Middle, and Left Veins##
Merge and exit toward the vena cava.  
Energetically, symbolize alignment and peaceful release.

###Function###
Remove filtered blood from the liver and return it to circulation.  
Balance internal pressure and detox flow.

###Common Imbalances###
Congestion: tension or stored emotion.  
Weak drainage: sluggishness or exhaustion.  
Energetic stagnation: difficulty releasing the past.  
Energetic depletion: low emotional flow.

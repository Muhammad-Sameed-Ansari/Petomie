#Bile Canaliculi#
Part of the Hepatobiliary System: Microscopic channels between hepatocytes that collect bile.
Energetically, they represent inner communication and delicate balance — the unseen pathways of cleansing.

###Parts###

Blockage: tension or emotional stagnation.  
Inflammation: internal irritation or overload.

Energetic weakness: low internal movement or vitality.

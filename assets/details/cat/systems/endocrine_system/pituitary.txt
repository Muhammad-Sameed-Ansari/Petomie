#Pituitary Gland (Hypophysis)#

##Parts##
###Anterior Lobe (Adenohypophysis)###
Produces and releases hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, stress, and reproduction.  
Key hormones include:  
- **GH (Growth Hormone):** Promotes growth and tissue repair.  
- **TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone):** Activates the thyroid gland.  
- **ACTH:** Stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.  
- **FSH & LH:** Control reproductive cycles and fertility.  
- **Prolactin:** Supports milk production in nursing queens.  

###Posterior Lobe (Neurohypophysis)###
Stores and releases hormones produced by the hypothalamus:  
- **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone):** Regulates water balance by controlling kidney absorption.  
- **Oxytocin:** Triggers uterine contractions during birth and milk letdown during nursing.  

###Infundibulum (Pituitary Stalk)###
Connects the gland to the hypothalamus, allowing nerve signals to regulate hormone release.

##Function##
Acts as the **master gland** of the endocrine system. It controls the activity of other glands, including the thyroid, adrenal glands, and gonads.  
It maintains growth, metabolism, stress balance, reproduction, and hydration throughout the body.

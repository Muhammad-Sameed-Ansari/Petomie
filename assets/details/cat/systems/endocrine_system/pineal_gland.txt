#Pineal Gland#

The pineal gland is a small, cone-shaped structure near the brain’s center.  
It produces melatonin, regulating sleep, circadian rhythm, and seasonal behavior.  
Energetically, it represents spiritual awareness, intuition, and alignment with natural cycles.

###Parts###

##Pinealocytes##  
Cells that secrete melatonin in response to light changes.  
Energetically, symbolize rhythm and receptivity.

###Function###  
Controls sleep-wake patterns and synchronizes biological rhythms.  
Energetically, connects the physical body to higher awareness and natural timing.

###Common Imbalances###  
Sleep disturbances: disconnection from rhythm.  
Low melatonin: imbalance in light and rest.  
Overactivity: hypersensitivity or overstimulation.

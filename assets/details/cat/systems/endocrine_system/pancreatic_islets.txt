#Pancreatic Islets (Islets of Langerhans)#

##Parts##
###Alpha Cells###
Produce **glucagon**, which raises blood sugar by releasing stored glucose from the liver.  

###Beta Cells###
Produce **insulin**, which lowers blood sugar by helping cells absorb glucose.  

###Delta Cells###
Produce **somatostatin**, which regulates both insulin and glucagon activity.  

##Function##
Maintains **blood glucose balance** and provides energy for muscles, brain, and organs.  
When insulin fails to work properly, blood sugar rises — a condition known as **diabetes mellitus**, common in older or overweight cats.

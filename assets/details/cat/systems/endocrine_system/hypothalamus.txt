#Hypothalamus#

Situated at the **base of the cat’s brain**, just below the **thalamus** and above the **pituitary gland**.  
It forms a vital bridge between the **nervous** and **endocrine systems**, controlling many automatic body functions.

###Shape###
A **small, almond-shaped** structure made of specialized nerve cells (nuclei).  
It surrounds part of the third ventricle in the brain and connects directly with the pituitary gland.

Acts as the **command center** that regulates the body’s internal balance.  
- Controls **body temperature**, **hunger**, **thirst**, and **sleep cycles**.  
- Coordinates **hormone release** through the pituitary gland.  
- Manages the **stress response**, **metabolism**, and **reproductive behavior**.  
- Keeps the **autonomic nervous system** (heart rate, digestion, respiration) balanced.

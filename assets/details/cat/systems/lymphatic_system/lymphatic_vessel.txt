#Lymphatic Vessels#

##Parts##

###Lymphatic Capillaries###
Tiny, thin-walled vessels located throughout the cat’s body, especially under the skin and in organs.
They collect interstitial fluid and begin lymph flow.
Energetically, they symbolize **receptivity**, sensing and collecting subtle signals from the environment and body.

###Larger Lymphatic Vessels###
Formed when capillaries merge into broader channels with valves that prevent backflow.
They travel alongside veins and arteries toward the chest.
Energetically, these vessels represent **release and transition**, guiding physical and emotional waste out of the system.

###Lymphatic Valves###
Small one-way gates that ensure lymph moves steadily toward the heart.
They open and close gently with each breath and muscle movement.
Energetically, they mirror **trust and rhythm**, showing how natural motion keeps the body’s energy balanced.

###Lymphatic Ducts###
The thoracic and right lymphatic ducts return lymph to the bloodstream near the heart.
Energetically, they symbolize **unity and reintegration**, merging purified energy back into the whole system.

##Function##
Lymphatic vessels transport lymph fluid, maintain fluid balance, and assist immune defense.
They also prevent swelling and congestion in tissues.
Energetically, they maintain **energetic circulation**, ensuring smooth flow and emotional balance throughout the body.

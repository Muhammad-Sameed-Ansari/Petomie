#Lymph Fluid#

##Parts##

###Lymph Fluid###
A clear, watery liquid that flows through the tissues of the cat’s body, collecting waste, proteins, and immune cells.
It originates from blood plasma that seeps out of capillaries and is then absorbed into lymphatic vessels.
Energetically, it symbolizes **cleansing, renewal, and flow**, allowing the cat’s sensitive body to release tension and stay balanced.

###Composition###
Contains white blood cells (lymphocytes), water, proteins, lipids, and waste substances.
The composition changes with hydration, diet, and immune activity.
Energetically, this reflects **adaptability**, mirroring the cat’s natural ability to shift energy and maintain equilibrium.

###Flow Path###
Moves through a network of lymphatic capillaries into larger vessels, passes through lymph nodes for filtration, and returns to the bloodstream.
Since the lymph system has no pump, movement depends on the cat’s body motion, stretching, and breathing.
Energetically, this rhythm embodies **grace and rhythm**, flowing with ease like the cat’s fluid movements.

##Function##
Removes toxins and waste, supports immune defense, and maintains tissue fluid balance.
It carries immune cells throughout the body, guarding against infections.
Energetically, lymph fluid represents **emotional purification**, helping the cat let go of heaviness and restore calm vitality.

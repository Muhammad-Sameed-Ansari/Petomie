#Spinal Cord#

##Location##
The spinal cord runs from the base of the brain down through the vertebral column (spine).  
It lies inside the spinal canal, protected by the surrounding bones, connective tissue, and fluid.  
It connects to nerves that branch out to every part of the body.

##Shape##
A long, cylindrical cord made of nerve fibers and support cells.  
It is divided into regions that correspond to different parts of the body — cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), sacral, and coccygeal.  
The spinal cord is gray in the center and white around the edges, and is surrounded by meninges and cerebrospinal fluid for protection.

##Function##
- Acts as the communication pathway between the brain and body.  
- Carries sensory information (touch, pain, temperature) from the body to the brain.  
- Sends motor commands from the brain to muscles for movement.  
- Controls reflexes that happen automatically without conscious thought.  
- Helps coordinate posture, balance, and movement.

#Brain#

##Location##
Situated within the cranial cavity of the skull, the brain is well-protected by the cranial bones and meninges.  
It connects to the spinal cord through the foramen magnum and serves as the central processing unit of the cat’s nervous system.

###Parts###
1. **Cerebrum** – The largest region of the brain, divided into left and right hemispheres.  
   Responsible for conscious thought, learning, sensory interpretation, voluntary movement, and problem-solving.  
   Regulates behavioral responses, memory, and environmental awareness.

2. **Cerebellum** – Located at the back of the brain beneath the cerebrum.  
   Coordinates fine motor control, balance, and posture.  
   Ensures smooth and precise movement during jumping, climbing, and stalking.  
   Plays a vital role in spatial awareness and body coordination.

3. **Brainstem** – Includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.  
   Serves as a communication link between the brain and spinal cord.  
   Regulates involuntary life-support functions such as heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure.  
   Controls reflexes, swallowing, and automatic responses to stimuli.

4. **Diencephalon** – Contains the thalamus and hypothalamus.  
   The thalamus relays sensory information to the cerebrum.  
   The hypothalamus manages temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, and emotional behavior.  
   Works closely with the pituitary gland to maintain hormonal balance.

5. **Pituitary Gland** – Attached to the hypothalamus and functions as the endocrine control center.  
   Produces hormones that influence growth, metabolism, stress response, and reproduction.

6. **Olfactory Bulbs** – Prominently developed structures located at the front of the brain.  
   Responsible for processing scent information, which is essential for hunting, recognition, and social behavior.

##Function##
, Coordinates voluntary and involuntary body functions.  
, Processes sensory input from vision, smell, hearing, and touch.  
, Controls movement, balance, and reflex actions.  
, Regulates vital bodily systems such as respiration, heartbeat, and digestion.  
, Governs behavior, emotion, and survival instincts.  
, Supports learning, memory, and adaptive responses to the environment.

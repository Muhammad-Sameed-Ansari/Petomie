#Meninges & Ventricles#

##Location##
The meninges and ventricles surround and protect the brain and spinal cord.  
The meninges are three protective layers of tissue covering the central nervous system, while the ventricles are fluid-filled spaces inside the brain.

##Shape##
- **Meninges:** Three layers —  
  - **Dura mater:** The tough outer covering that lies against the skull or vertebrae.  
  - **Arachnoid mater:** The middle, web-like layer.  
  - **Pia mater:** The thin inner layer that closely covers the brain and spinal cord.  
- **Ventricles:** Four connected chambers inside the brain that contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  
The CSF flows around and through the ventricles, cushioning and protecting nervous tissue.

##Function##
- Protects the brain and spinal cord from impact and injury.  
- Provides nutrients and removes waste through cerebrospinal fluid circulation.  
- Maintains stable pressure around the brain and spinal cord.  
- Acts as a shock absorber for sudden movements.  
- Supports the brain’s weight and prevents it from pressing on the skull.  
- Helps transport hormones and chemical signals within the brain.

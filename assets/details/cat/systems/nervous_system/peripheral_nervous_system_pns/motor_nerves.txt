#Motor Nerves#

##Location##
Motor nerves extend from the **spinal cord and brainstem** to the **muscles and glands** of the body.  
They are found throughout the head, trunk, and limbs, controlling voluntary and involuntary movements.

###Shape###
Bundles of **long, cord-like fibers** that leave the spinal cord and branch into smaller nerves connecting to muscles.  
They often travel next to blood vessels and other nerves.

##Function##
- Carry **movement commands** from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles.  
- Allow the cat to **walk, run, stretch, blink, and groom**.  
- Control both **voluntary muscles** (those the cat moves consciously) and **involuntary muscles** (those that work automatically).  
- Two main types:  
  - **Somatic Motor Nerves:** control voluntary muscles for posture, walking, jumping, chewing, or tail movement.  
  - **Visceral Motor Nerves:** part of the autonomic system; control smooth muscles in internal organs and glands.  
- Keep the body balanced and coordinated by responding quickly to signals from the sensory nerves.  

Damage to motor nerves can cause weakness, loss of coordination, or paralysis in affected muscles.

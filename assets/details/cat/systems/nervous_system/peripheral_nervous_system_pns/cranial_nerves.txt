#Cranial Nerves#

##Location##
Cranial nerves arise directly from the **brain**, mainly from the **brainstem**, and extend to the **head, face, neck, and some internal organs**.  
Cats have **12 pairs** of cranial nerves — one pair on each side of the body.

###Shape###
Small paired nerve bundles that exit the skull through tiny openings and spread to the muscles, glands, and sensory organs in the head.

##Function##
Each cranial nerve has a **specific role** — some sensory, some motor, and some both:  
1. **Olfactory (I):** smell  
2. **Optic (II):** vision  
3. **Oculomotor (III):** eye movement and pupil size  
4. **Trochlear (IV):** moves one eye muscle (superior oblique)  
5. **Trigeminal (V):** facial sensation and chewing  
6. **Abducens (VI):** moves the eyes outward  
7. **Facial (VII):** facial expression, tear and saliva production, taste  
8. **Vestibulocochlear (VIII):** hearing and balance  
9. **Glossopharyngeal (IX):** taste, swallowing, salivation  
10. **Vagus (X):** controls organs like heart, lungs, and intestines  
11. **Accessory (XI):** moves neck and shoulder muscles  
12. **Hypoglossal (XII):** tongue movement  

Together, they allow the cat to see, hear, smell, taste, blink, meow, swallow, and control internal organ function.

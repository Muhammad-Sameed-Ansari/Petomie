#Sensory Nerves#

##Location##
Sensory nerves are spread throughout the **body**, especially in the **skin, muscles, joints, whiskers, and internal organs**.  
They collect information from the outside world and the cat’s own body.

###Shape###
Small **receptor endings** in the skin and organs connect to long fibers that travel to the spinal cord and then to the brain.

##Function##
- Detects **touch, temperature, pressure, pain, and body position**.  
- **Whisker nerves** (vibrissae) are highly sensitive to movement and air changes.  
- **Proprioceptive nerves** sense where the body and limbs are in space.  
- **Visceral sensory nerves** detect organ pressure, stretching, or discomfort.  

These nerves help the cat react quickly, stay balanced, and move gracefully while hunting, climbing, or grooming.

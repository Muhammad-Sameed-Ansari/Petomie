#Spinal Nerves#

##Location##
Spinal nerves branch from the **spinal cord** through openings between the **vertebrae**.  
Each segment of the spinal cord gives rise to a pair of nerves — one on each side — forming about **38 pairs** (C1–C8, T1–T13, L1–L7, S1–S3, Cd1–Cd7).

###Shape###
Short roots merge into a single mixed nerve that divides again into dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) branches.  
They run along the length of the spine, branching into smaller nerves that serve muscles, skin, and internal organs.

##Function##
- **Transmit signals** between spinal cord and body tissues.  
- **Motor fibers:** send movement commands to muscles.  
- **Sensory fibers:** carry touch, pressure, and pain information.  
- **Autonomic fibers:** manage involuntary actions like digestion and heartbeat.  

Main regions:  
- **Cervical Nerves:** neck and front limbs (through brachial plexus).  
- **Thoracic Nerves:** chest, ribs, and back.  
- **Lumbar Nerves:** abdomen and hind limbs.  
- **Sacral Nerves:** tail base, bladder, and pelvis.  
- **Caudal Nerves:** tail movement and sensation.

#Brachial Plexus#

##Location##
The brachial plexus is found deep within the **shoulder region (axilla)**, between the lower neck and the upper front leg.  
It is formed by the **ventral branches of spinal nerves C6 to T2** in the cat.

###Shape###
A thick **bundle of interconnected nerves** that branch and spread through the chest, shoulder, and forelimb areas.  
From this plexus, several smaller nerves emerge to supply the muscles and skin of the forelimb.

##Function##
- The brachial plexus controls **movement and sensation** in the cat’s front limbs.  
- It sends **motor commands** to the muscles of the shoulder, elbow, and paw, and receives **sensory signals** from the skin and joints of the forelimb.  
- Major nerves arising from the brachial plexus include:  
  - **Suprascapular Nerve:** moves the shoulder (supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles).  
  - **Subscapular Nerve:** rotates the shoulder inward.  
  - **Musculocutaneous Nerve:** bends the elbow and provides feeling along the forearm.  
  - **Radial Nerve:** extends the elbow, wrist, and toes; essential for standing and walking.  
  - **Median Nerve:** controls the front paw’s flexor muscles and sensation on the lower forelimb.  
  - **Ulnar Nerve:** helps flex the paw and provides feeling to the paw and digits.  
  - **Thoracodorsal Nerve:** activates muscles of the shoulder and upper back.  
  - **Lateral Thoracic Nerve:** moves chest wall muscles and controls skin sensation.  

##Notes##
Injury to the brachial plexus can cause weakness, loss of coordination, or paralysis of the front limb.  
Mild injury may result in partial movement loss, while severe damage can cause total limb paralysis.

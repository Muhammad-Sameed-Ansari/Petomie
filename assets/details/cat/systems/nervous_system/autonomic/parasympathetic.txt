#Parasympathetic Nervous System#

##Location##
The parasympathetic system originates from the **brainstem** and the **sacral spinal cord (S2–S5)**.  
The main nerve, the **Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X)**, travels through the neck and connects to the **heart, lungs, and digestive organs**.  
Other parasympathetic nerves supply the **eyes, salivary glands, bladder, and intestines**.

###Shape###
A network of **long preganglionic fibers** that travel from the brain or sacral region to **small ganglia near or within the organs**.  
From there, **short postganglionic fibers** reach the target tissues.

##Function##
- Controls the **“rest and digest”** state — calming the body after stress.  
- **Slows heart rate** and lowers blood pressure.  
- **Stimulates digestion** and saliva flow for food breakdown.  
- Increases **gut movement (peristalsis)** and enzyme release.  
- **Constricts pupils** to normal size.  
- Promotes **urination and defecation**.  
- Encourages **healing and relaxation** by saving energy.  

##Examples##
- After eating, parasympathetic activity helps the cat digest food by activating gut and gland functions.  
- During rest, it slows breathing and heart rate, helping the cat recover energy.

##Notes##
The parasympathetic system balances the body after sympathetic activation.  
Calm feeding, gentle touch, and a peaceful home help keep this system strong.

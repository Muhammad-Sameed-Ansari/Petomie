#Sympathetic Nervous System#

##Location##
The sympathetic system runs mainly along the **thoracic and lumbar regions** of the spinal cord.  
Its nerve fibers exit from **spinal segments T1 to L4** and connect to paired chains of **sympathetic ganglia** that run along both sides of the spine.  
Branches extend to the **heart, lungs, eyes, digestive tract, blood vessels, and sweat glands**.

###Shape###
Two long **chains of ganglia (nerve centers)** linked by fine fibers, resembling a ladder beside the spinal cord.  
From each ganglion, small nerves branch out to internal organs and tissues.

##Function##
- Triggers the **“fight or flight”** response to prepare the cat for action or danger.  
- Increases **heart rate** and **blood pressure**.  
- Dilates **airways** for more oxygen intake.  
- **Redirects blood** from the intestines to the muscles.  
- **Widens pupils** to improve vision in low light.  
- Reduces **saliva and digestive secretions** during stress.  
- Stimulates **sweat glands** on the paws and releases **stored energy** from the liver and muscles.  

##Examples##
- When a cat sees a threat, its pupils widen, heart rate rises, and muscles tense — all controlled by the sympathetic system.  
- It also helps the cat stay alert, agile, and focused in high-stress or hunting situations.

##Notes##
Overactive sympathetic function from chronic stress or fear can cause tension, digestive upset, or hair loss.  
A calm, safe environment helps rebalance this system.

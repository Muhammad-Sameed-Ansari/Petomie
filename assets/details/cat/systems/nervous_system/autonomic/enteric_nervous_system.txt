#Enteric Nervous System#

##Location##
The enteric nervous system (ENS) lies within the **walls of the digestive tract**, extending from the **esophagus to the rectum**.  
It contains two main networks of nerve cells called **plexuses**:  
- **Myenteric Plexus (Auerbach’s):** between muscle layers, controlling gut movement.  
- **Submucosal Plexus (Meissner’s):** in the mucosal layer, controlling secretions and blood flow.  

###Shape###
A large web of **millions of small neurons** forming independent circuits along the digestive tract.  
It operates semi-independently from the brain and spinal cord, often called the “gut brain.”

##Function##
- Regulates **muscle contractions** to move food (peristalsis).  
- Controls **digestive secretions** and **blood flow** in the intestines.  
- Senses **chemical changes** and **stretching** in the gut wall.  
- Communicates with both **sympathetic and parasympathetic systems**, but can also function on its own.  
- Maintains **steady digestion and nutrient absorption**.  

##Examples##
- When a cat eats, the ENS controls how the stomach churns and intestines move food.  
- It detects fullness or discomfort, sending signals that affect appetite or posture.

##Notes##
Stress, diet changes, or illness can disrupt enteric nerve balance, leading to vomiting or diarrhea.  
A consistent diet, hydration, and calm feeding help keep the ENS healthy.

#Respiratory System – Lower Tract#

##Location##
The lower respiratory tract includes the **bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, alveoli, diaphragm, and pleura**.  
It lies within the **thoracic cavity**, protected by the ribs.

##Shape##
Consists of **branching airways** leading into two spongy lungs.  
The airways end in microscopic sacs (alveoli) where gas exchange occurs.

##Parts##

###1. Bronchi###
- Two main branches of the trachea that enter the lungs.  
- **Function:** Carry air into each lung.  

###2. Bronchioles###
- Smaller branches of the bronchi.  
- **Function:** Distribute air evenly within the lungs.  

###3. Alveoli###
- Tiny air sacs surrounded by capillaries.  
- **Function:** Exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood.  

###4. Lungs###
- Two large organs filling most of the chest cavity.  
- **Function:** Perform gas exchange and oxygenate the blood.  

###5. Diaphragm###
- Dome-shaped muscle separating chest and abdomen.  
- **Function:** Contracts for inhalation, relaxes for exhalation.  

###6. Pleura###
- Thin double-layered membranes covering the lungs.  
- **Function:** Reduce friction and protect lung tissue during breathing.  

##Function##
- **Gas exchange:** Oxygen moves into blood, carbon dioxide leaves it.  
- **Ventilation:** Draws air in and out of the lungs.  
- **Protection:** Filters and moistens air.  
- **Regulation:** Helps maintain pH and temperature balance.

#Lungs#
The lungs are paired organs that fill most of the thoracic cavity.  
They draw in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide — the essence of life’s rhythm.  
Energetically, they represent acceptance, renewal, and emotional release.

###Parts###

##Right and Left Lobes##  
Expand and contract during breathing.  
Energetically, symbolize balance and flow between giving and receiving.

##Pleura##  
Membrane surrounding the lungs.  
Energetically, reflects protection and harmony.

###Function###  
Perform gas exchange and maintain oxygen balance.  
Energetically, restore clarity, trust, and flow in the rhythm of life.

###Common Imbalances###  
Pneumonia: emotional heaviness or grief.  
Asthma: tension or suppressed emotion.  
Energetic stagnation: resistance to change or breath of life.

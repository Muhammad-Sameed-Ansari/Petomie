#Tracheal Bifurcation (Carina)#

The cat’s tracheal bifurcation, or carina, is the point where the trachea splits into the left and right main bronchi.  
It ensures smooth airflow into both lungs and supports the cat’s sensitive respiratory system.  
Energetically, it represents clarity, direction, and balanced flow.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Ridge##  
A stable ridge dividing the bronchi.  
Energetically, it symbolizes strength and guidance.

##Mucosal Lining##  
Soft tissue lining supporting airflow and protection.  
Energetically, it reflects sensitivity and intuitive flow.

##Left and Right Bronchial Openings##  
Openings that guide air into each lung.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and dual awareness.

###Function###  
The carina directs airflow into both lungs and activates the cough reflex when irritated.  
Energetically, it supports centered movement and balanced choices.

###Common Imbalances###  
Irritation: coughing or discomfort.  
Inflammation: breathing difficulty.  
Obstruction: restricted airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from indecision or blocked direction.

#Respiratory System – Upper Tract#

##Location##
The upper respiratory tract includes the **nostrils, nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, and trachea**.  
It is located in the **head and neck**, forming the main pathway for air entering the lungs.

##Shape##
A system of **hollow, air-filled tubes** lined with mucous membranes and cilia that trap dust, pollen, and other particles before they reach the lungs.

##Parts##

###1. Nostrils (Nares)###
- Openings at the tip of the nose.  
- **Function:** Allow air to enter and filter large particles.  

###2. Nasal Cavities###
- Air passages lined with turbinates and mucus.  
- **Function:** Warm, moisten, and filter air; contain scent receptors important for a cat’s strong sense of smell.  

###3. Pharynx###
- The throat, connecting the nasal cavity and mouth to the larynx and esophagus.  
- **Function:** Directs air toward the larynx and food toward the esophagus.  

###4. Larynx (Voice Box)###
- Contains the vocal cords and epiglottis.  
- **Function:** Produces sound (meowing/purring) and closes the airway during swallowing.  

###5. Trachea (Windpipe)###
- A flexible tube with C-shaped cartilage rings leading from the larynx into the chest.  
- **Function:** Carries air to and from the lungs.  

##Function##
- **Air filtration:** Cleans and humidifies incoming air.  
- **Sound production:** Allows vocalization.  
- **Protection:** Prevents aspiration of food and liquids.  
- **Olfaction:** Enhances the cat’s ability to detect scents.

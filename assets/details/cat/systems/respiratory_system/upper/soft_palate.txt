#Soft Palate#

The cat’s soft palate is a flexible muscular fold that separates the oral and nasal cavities during swallowing.  
It helps protect the airway and maintain smooth breathing.  
Energetically, it represents boundaries, fluidity, and ease in transitions.

###Parts###

##Muscular Layer##  
Raises and lowers to control airflow and swallowing.  
Energetically, it symbolizes adaptability and gentle control.

##Mucosal Surface##  
Soft tissue covering that maintains moisture and protection.  
Energetically, it reflects sensitivity and awareness.

##Free Border##  
The movable back edge guiding airflow shifts.  
Energetically, it represents choice and direction.

###Function###  
The soft palate prevents food from entering the nasal cavity and assists airflow regulation.  
Energetically, it supports balance, smooth transitions, and coordinated expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Elongation: snoring or airflow disruption.  
Inflammation: swallowing difficulty.  
Weakness: reduced coordination.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from disrupted boundaries.

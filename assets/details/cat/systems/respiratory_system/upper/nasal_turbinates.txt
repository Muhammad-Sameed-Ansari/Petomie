#Nasal Turbinates#

The cat’s nasal turbinates are delicate, scroll‑like bones within the nasal passages that warm, filter, and humidify inhaled air.  
They also support the cat’s refined sense of smell.  
Energetically, they represent clarity, sensitivity, and gentle preparation.

###Parts###

##Dorsal Turbinates##  
Upper scrolls guiding airflow and filtering particles.  
Energetically, they symbolize clarity and insight.

##Ventral Turbinates##  
Lower scrolls warming and humidifying air.  
Energetically, they represent grounding and nourishment.

##Mucosal Lining##  
A moist, sensitive surface supporting filtration and airflow health.  
Energetically, it reflects intuition and smooth flow.

###Function###  
Nasal turbinates regulate airflow, filter debris, and condition inhaled air.  
Energetically, they support purification and clear perception.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: congestion or noisy breathing.  
Allergic reaction: swelling and irritation.  
Structural narrowing: reduced airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from overstimulation or unclear input.

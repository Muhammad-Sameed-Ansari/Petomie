#Ethmoid Turbinates#

The cat’s ethmoid turbinates form a fine, intricate labyrinth responsible for detecting scents.  
They support the cat’s heightened sensitivity to odors.  
Energetically, they represent intuition, subtle awareness, and deep perception.

###Parts###

##Olfactory Lamellae##  
Sensory layers detecting scent particles.  
Energetically, they symbolize intuition and insight.

##Ethmoidal Scrolls##  
Delicate bony folds guiding airflow to olfactory areas.  
Energetically, they reflect balance and subtle guidance.

##Olfactory Mucosa##  
Rich sensory lining enabling scent detection.  
Energetically, it represents emotional perception and inner knowing.

###Function###  
These structures support advanced olfactory sensing and airflow refinement.  
Energetically, they enhance intuitive connection and inner clarity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: reduced smell or discomfort.  
Infection: congestion or altered perception.  
Trauma: impaired airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from sensory overload.

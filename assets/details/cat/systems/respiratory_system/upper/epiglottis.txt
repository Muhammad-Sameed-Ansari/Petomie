#Epiglottis#

The cat’s epiglottis is a leaf‑shaped cartilage that protects the airway during swallowing.  
It ensures that food is directed safely into the esophagus.  
Energetically, it represents protection, clarity, and guided movement.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Base##  
Provides structural stability.  
Energetically, it symbolizes grounding and strength.

##Elastic Tip##  
Allows flexible movement during swallowing and breathing.  
Energetically, it reflects adaptability and responsiveness.

##Mucosal Surface##  
Smooth lining that protects tissue.  
Energetically, it represents sensitivity and gentle guidance.

###Function###  
The epiglottis prevents aspiration and supports smooth airflow transitions.  
Energetically, it encourages trust, clarity, and protective flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: irritation or coughing.  
Restricted mobility: swallowing issues.  
Sensitivity: gagging or discomfort.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from feeling unprotected.

#Paranasal Sinuses#

The cat’s paranasal sinuses are small air‑filled cavities within the skull that lighten its structure and support airflow.  
Energetically, they represent spaciousness, clarity, and internal balance.

###Parts###

##Frontal Sinus##  
Located above the eyes.  
Energetically, it symbolizes insight and perspective.

##Maxillary Sinus##  
Found within the upper jaw region.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and support.

##Sphenoidal Sinus##  
A deeper sinus contributing to airflow balance.  
Energetically, it represents inner flow and subtle alignment.

###Function###  
The sinuses warm air, support resonance, and lighten the skull.  
Energetically, they create space, clarity, and harmonious flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Sinusitis: congestion or discomfort.  
Swelling: reduced airflow.  
Blockage: pressure buildup.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from internal pressure or blocked clarity.

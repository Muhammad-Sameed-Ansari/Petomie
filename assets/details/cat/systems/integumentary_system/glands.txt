#Glands#

The skin’s glands regulate oil balance and scent communication.  
Cats use these glands for marking, grooming, and maintaining coat health.  
Energetically, they represent flow, harmony, and emotional expression.

###Parts###

##Sebaceous Glands##  
Secrete oils that coat and protect the fur.  
Energetically, symbolize smoothness and connection.

##Sweat Glands##  
Limited and primarily found in paws.  
Energetically, reflect release and adaptability.

###Function###  
Maintain coat shine, scent communication, and regulate minor temperature shifts.  
Energetically, express comfort, identity, and inner flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blocked glands: withheld emotion.  
Overactivity: tension or over-sensitivity.  
Dry skin: imbalance in self-expression.

#Integumentary System – Epidermis (Cat)#

##Location##
The epidermis forms the **outermost layer** of the cat’s skin, covering the entire body including the face, limbs, and tail.  
It lies above the dermis and serves as the first physical barrier against the environment.

##Shape##
A **thin, elastic layer** of keratinized epithelial cells that constantly renews.  
Thicker on paw pads and thinner in areas such as the abdomen and inner thighs.

#Radial Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: The largest nerve of the brachial plexus (C7–T2), controlling extension of the elbow, carpus, and digits.

##Pathway##  
Wraps around the humerus and runs along the lateral forelimb.  
Energetically, reflects courage, movement, and clear intention.

##Branches##  
Motor to triceps and extensors; sensory to dorsal paw surface.  
Energetically, connects power with awareness and precision.

###Function###  
Extends the elbow and paw, enabling forward propulsion and stability.  
Energetically, supports self-expression through confident motion.

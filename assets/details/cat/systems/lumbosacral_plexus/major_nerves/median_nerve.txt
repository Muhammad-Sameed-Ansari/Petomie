#Median Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: A branch of the brachial plexus (C7–T1) that innervates flexor muscles of the forearm and paw.  
Energetically, it represents adaptability, precision, and dexterity — the ability to act with purpose and subtle control.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from spinal nerves C7–T1 within the brachial plexus.  
Energetically, symbolizes coordination and fluid balance.

##Pathway##  
Runs along the medial side of the forelimb to the carpus and digits.  
Energetically, reflects focus and directed intention.

##Branches##  
Motor to flexors of the carpus and digits; sensory to palmar paw surface.  
Energetically, supports sensitivity and expression in touch.

###Function###  
Controls flexion of the paw and digits, and provides sensory input from the palmar paw.  
Energetically, enables fine control and awareness of contact with life.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak grip: loss of confidence or focus.  
Numbness: emotional detachment or dullness.  
Energetic blockage: inability to connect or express.

#Gluteal Nerves#
Part of the Nervous System: Branches of the lumbosacral plexus (L6–S1) that innervate the gluteal muscles.  
Energetically, they represent power, propulsion, and balance — the drive to move forward with grace and control.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arise from the ventral branches of spinal nerves L6–S1.  
Energetically, symbolize strength and grounded action.

##Pathway##  
Emerge from the pelvis to supply the superficial, middle, and deep gluteal muscles.  
Energetically, reflect flow, stability, and confidence in motion.

##Branches##  
Cranial and caudal gluteal nerves.  
Energetically, represent direction and balanced effort.

###Function###  
Provide motor control to the hip extensors and abductors.  
Enable propulsion, jumping, and coordinated rear limb motion.  
Energetically, govern strength, balance, and dynamic expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: lack of power or hesitation.  
Pain: restriction or fear of progress.  
Energetic stagnation: blocked motivation or grounded drive.

#Sciatic Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: The largest nerve of the body, arising from L6–S2 and supplying the caudal thigh, leg, and paw.  
Energetically, it represents strength, grounding, and the flow of life force through action.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Derived from spinal nerves L6–S2.  
Energetically, symbolizes stability and direction in motion.

##Pathway##  
Passes through the pelvis, behind the femur, and branches into the tibial and peroneal nerves.  
Energetically, reflects movement, endurance, and trust in forward flow.

##Branches##  
Tibial and common peroneal nerves.  
Energetically, express coordination and fluidity.

###Function###  
Controls extension of the hip, flexion of the stifle, and movement of the paw.  
Provides sensory input from much of the hind limb.  
Energetically, anchors power, trust, and progress.

###Common Imbalances###  
Pain: tension or suppressed motion.  
Weakness: lack of drive or grounding.  
Energetic stagnation: blocked flow or fear of movement.

#Femoral Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: A major branch of the lumbar plexus (originating from L4–L6) that supplies the muscles of the thigh and sensory regions of the hind limb.  
Energetically, it represents strength, grounded confidence, and balanced movement — the courage to move forward with stability.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from the ventral branches of spinal nerves L4–L6 in the lumbar plexus.  
Energetically, symbolizes core stability and foundation.

##Pathway##  
Passes through the iliopsoas muscle, beneath the inguinal ligament, into the thigh.  
Energetically, reflects smooth flow and grounded direction.

##Branches##  
Motor to quadriceps femoris and sensory via the saphenous nerve to the medial hind limb.  
Energetically, represents empowerment and forward momentum.

###Function###  
Controls extension of the stifle and provides sensation to the inner thigh and lower limb.  
Supports coordinated movement and weight-bearing.  
Energetically, governs confidence, direction, and stable progress.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: instability or loss of control.  
Pain or compression: fear of movement or imbalance in grounding.  
Energetic stagnation: hesitation or blocked progress.

#Lumbosacral Plexus#

##Location##
The lumbosacral plexus in the cat is found in the **lower back and pelvic region**.  
It is formed by the **ventral branches of spinal nerves L4 to S3**.  
This network lies deep within the muscles near the lumbar vertebrae and sacrum, sending branches to the **hind limbs, pelvic organs, and tail**.

###Shape###
A compact **network of nerve fibers** where several spinal nerves join together before dividing into multiple branches.  
These nerves travel through the pelvis to reach the muscles and skin of the hind limbs and tail.

##Function##
The lumbosacral plexus provides **movement and feeling** to the hind legs, pelvic region, and tail.  
It sends **motor signals** to move the hind limbs and tail, and carries **sensory signals** from the skin and joints back to the spinal cord.

Main nerves that arise from the lumbosacral plexus include:  
- **Femoral Nerve:** extends the stifle and helps the cat stand, walk, and jump.  
- **Obturator Nerve:** moves the inner thigh muscles that bring the hind legs inward.  
- **Sciatic Nerve:** the largest nerve; runs down the back of the thigh and splits into two main branches:  
  - **Tibial Nerve:** runs down the back of the lower leg and controls paw flexion.  
  - **Peroneal (Fibular) Nerve:** runs along the outer lower leg and lifts the paw and toes.  
- **Gluteal Nerves:** control the hip and upper hind limb muscles.  
- **Pudendal Nerve:** supplies the pelvic floor, genital region, and skin around the anus.  
- **Caudal Rectal Nerve:** controls muscles around the anus and helps with bowel control.  

##Examples##
When a cat jumps, stretches, or balances on its hind legs, the lumbosacral plexus coordinates these actions.  
It also provides sensitivity in the tail and hindquarters, allowing precise and agile movements.

##Notes##
Injury or pressure in this area may cause limping, weakness, or loss of sensation in the hind legs or tail.  
Maintaining flexibility, proper movement, and preventing back strain help keep these nerves healthy.

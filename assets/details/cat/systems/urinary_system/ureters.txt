#Ureters#

###Location###
Run from the kidneys to the urinary bladder along the dorsal abdominal wall.

###Shape###
Thin, muscular tubes with smooth linings that contract rhythmically.

###Parts###
- **Upper Section:** Begins at the renal pelvis.  
- **Middle Section:** Travels through the abdominal cavity.  
- **Lower Section:** Connects to the bladder at an oblique angle.

###Function###
- Transport urine from kidneys to the bladder via peristaltic waves.  
- Prevent backflow of urine using a one-way valve mechanism at the bladder entry.

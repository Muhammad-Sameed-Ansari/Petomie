#Arteries#

The **cat’s arteries** form a powerful network of vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to all body tissues.  
They are strong, elastic tubes designed to handle high pressure and ensure constant nourishment to every cell.  
Energetically, the arteries represent **drive, direction, and the outward flow of life energy** — the pulse of creation that sustains vitality.

###Parts###

##Aorta##
The largest artery, emerging from the left ventricle.  
Carries oxygen-rich blood to all body regions.  
Energetically, it represents **direction and purpose**, guiding life force from the heart outward.

##Pulmonary Arteries##
Carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.  
Energetically, they symbolize **transformation and renewal**, bringing energy for purification.

##Carotid Arteries##
Supply the head and brain with oxygenated blood.  
Energetically, they embody **clarity and communication**, nourishing awareness and voice.

##Coronary Arteries##
Feed the heart muscle itself.  
Energetically, they reflect **self-care and sustenance**, reminding that even the giver must receive.

##Femoral, Iliac, and Brachial Arteries##
Distribute blood to the limbs, maintaining motion and strength.  
Energetically, they represent **movement and flow**, delivering power to create and act.

###Function###
Arteries carry oxygenated blood under high pressure from the heart to all tissues.  
They maintain circulation, regulate pressure, and support organ vitality.  

Energetically, they symbolize **expansion and vitality**, distributing life force throughout the system.

###Common Imbalances###
Arterial constriction: Cold limbs or weak pulse.  
Inflammation: Arteritis causing stiffness or heat.  
Blockage: Poor oxygenation or fatigue.  
Energetic blockage: Fear of progress or resistance to flow.  
Energetic weakness: Lack of motivation or low drive.  
Energetic overload: Overactivity, tension, or high internal pressure.

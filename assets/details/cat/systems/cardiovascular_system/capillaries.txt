#Capillaries#

The **cat’s capillaries** are the smallest blood vessels, forming bridges between arteries and veins.  
They enable the exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes at a cellular level.  
Energetically, they represent **connection, communication, and mutual support** within the living system.

###Parts###

##Arterioles##
Tiny vessels leading from arteries to capillary beds.  
Energetically, they symbolize **transition and distribution**.

##Capillary Beds##
Microscopic networks where exchange of gases and nutrients occurs.  
Energetically, represent **connection and communication** between all cells.

##Venules##
Collect blood from capillaries and channel it into veins.  
Energetically, embody **collection and integration of experience**.

###Function###
Capillaries facilitate the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste between blood and tissues.  
They form the essential link for cellular nourishment.  

Energetically, they symbolize **interconnectedness**, where giving and receiving meet in harmony.

###Common Imbalances###
Poor perfusion: Cold extremities or tissue weakness.  
Leakage: Inflammation or fragility.  
Energetic disconnection: Isolation or weak cellular communication.

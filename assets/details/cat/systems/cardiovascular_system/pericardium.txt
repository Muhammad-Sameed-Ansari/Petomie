#Pericardium#

The cat’s pericardium is a delicate but protective double-layered sac surrounding the heart.  
It stabilizes the heart and allows smooth, friction-free beats.  
Energetically, it represents sensitivity, emotional protection, and the quiet strength of the heart.

###Parts###

##Fibrous Pericardium##  
A firm outer layer that anchors and protects the heart.  
Energetically, it symbolizes grounding and secure boundaries.

##Serous Pericardium##  
A smooth inner membrane that glides with each heartbeat.  
Energetically, it reflects fluidity, intuition, and emotional grace.

##Pericardial Cavity##  
A small fluid-filled space enabling smooth movement.  
Energetically, it represents spaciousness and gentle support.

###Function###  
The pericardium cushions the heart, reduces friction, and maintains correct position within the chest.  
Energetically, it supports emotional harmony, inner softness, and balanced expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: discomfort or restricted motion.  
Fluid accumulation: pressure on the heart.  
Irritation: reduced ease of movement.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from overwhelm, sensitivity, or emotional contraction.

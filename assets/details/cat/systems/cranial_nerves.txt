#Cranial Nerves#

##Location##
Cranial nerves come directly from the brain, mainly from the underside of the brainstem.  
There are twelve pairs in total, one on each side of the head.  
They pass through small openings in the skull and connect the brain to the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and facial muscles.  
Each nerve serves a special function related to movement, sensation, or internal control.

##Shape##
Each cranial nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers wrapped in protective tissue.  
Some carry only sensory signals, others only motor signals, and some do both.  
They are numbered I to XII according to where they leave the brain — from front to back.

### The 12 Cranial Nerves in Cats
1. **Olfactory (I):** Smell — detects scents in the nose.  
2. **Optic (II):** Vision — carries signals from the eyes to the brain.  
3. **Oculomotor (III):** Eye movement and pupil constriction.  
4. **Trochlear (IV):** Controls one eye muscle for upward and sideways motion.  
5. **Trigeminal (V):** Touch and pain in the face and mouth; chewing muscles.  
6. **Abducens (VI):** Controls side movement of the eyes.  
7. **Facial (VII):** Facial expression, taste on the front of the tongue, tear and saliva production.  
8. **Vestibulocochlear (VIII):** Hearing and balance.  
9. **Glossopharyngeal (IX):** Taste (back of tongue), swallowing, and saliva production.  
10. **Vagus (X):** Controls internal organs (heart, lungs, digestive tract); also helps with swallowing and voice.  
11. **Accessory (XI):** Neck and shoulder movement.  
12. **Hypoglossal (XII):** Tongue movement for eating and grooming.

##Function##
- Transmit signals between the brain and the head, neck, and some internal organs.  
- Control smell, sight, hearing, taste, and balance.  
- Manage facial movements, swallowing, and vocal sounds.  
- Regulate automatic actions like breathing, heart rate, and digestion.  
- Support expression, feeding, grooming, and social communication.  
- Keep sensory and motor functions well-coordinated for survival and comfort.

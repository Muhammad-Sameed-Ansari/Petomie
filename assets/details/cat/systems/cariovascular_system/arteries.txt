#Arteries#

##Location##
Arteries are **thick, muscular blood vessels** that carry **oxygen-rich blood away from the heart** to all tissues and organs.  
They run deep within the body and branch into smaller arterioles and capillaries.

##Shape##
Arteries have **thick elastic walls** to withstand the high pressure created by the heart’s pumping action.

##Parts##

###1. Aorta###
- The largest artery, leaving the left ventricle.  
- **Function:** Distributes oxygenated blood to the entire body.  

###2. Pulmonary Arteries###
- Carry oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.  
- **Function:** Allow blood to pick up oxygen.  

###3. Coronary Arteries###
- Surround the heart.  
- **Function:** Supply the heart muscle itself with blood and oxygen.  

###4. Carotid Arteries###
- Found in the neck.  
- **Function:** Supply oxygen-rich blood to the head and brain.  

###5. Femoral Arteries###
- Run along the inner thighs.  
- **Function:** Supply blood to the hind limbs.  

###6. Renal Arteries###
- Connected to the kidneys.  
- **Function:** Supply oxygenated blood for filtering waste.  

##Function##
- **Transport:** Carry oxygen and nutrients to organs and tissues.  
- **Pressure regulation:** Maintain stable blood flow through elasticity.  
- **Support:** Help control body temperature by adjusting blood flow.

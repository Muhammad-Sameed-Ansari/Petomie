#Capillaries#

##Location##
Capillaries are **tiny blood vessels** found throughout the entire body.  
They form a network that connects **arteries** (which carry blood away from the heart) with **veins** (which return blood to the heart).  
They are especially dense in tissues that need a lot of oxygen, such as the **lungs, muscles, kidneys, and brain**.

##Shape##
Capillaries are **microscopic, thin-walled tubes** — only one cell thick.  
Their delicate walls allow oxygen, nutrients, and waste to move easily between blood and body tissues.

##Parts##

###1. Arterioles###
- The smallest branches of arteries.  
- **Function:** Deliver oxygenated blood into capillaries and control blood pressure in tissues.  

###2. Venules###
- Small vessels that connect capillaries to veins.  
- **Function:** Collect deoxygenated blood and carry it back toward the heart.  

###3. Capillary Beds###
- Networks of many capillaries within a tissue.  
- **Function:** Provide oxygen and nutrients to cells while collecting carbon dioxide and waste.  

###4. Endothelial Cells###
- The single layer of cells forming the capillary wall.  
- **Function:** Allow exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste between blood and tissues.  

##Function##
- **Gas exchange:** Deliver oxygen to tissues and remove carbon dioxide.  
- **Nutrient delivery:** Supply nutrients, hormones, and water to body cells.  
- **Waste removal:** Carry away waste products for excretion.  
- **Temperature regulation:** Expand or contract to control heat loss.  
- **Balance:** Maintain fluid exchange between blood and tissues.

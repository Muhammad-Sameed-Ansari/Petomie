#Veins#

##Location##
Veins are **thin-walled blood vessels** that carry **oxygen-poor blood back to the heart**.  
They are found throughout the body and often lie closer to the surface of the skin than arteries.

##Shape##
Veins have **thin, flexible walls** with **valves** that prevent blood from flowing backward as it moves toward the heart.

##Parts##

###1. Vena Cava (Cranial & Caudal)###
- The largest veins in the body.  
- **Function:** Collect blood from the upper and lower parts of the body and deliver it to the right atrium.  

###2. Pulmonary Veins###
- Carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium.  
- **Function:** Complete the oxygenation cycle.  

###3. Jugular Veins###
- Located on both sides of the neck.  
- **Function:** Drain blood from the head and brain.  

###4. Femoral Veins###
- Found in the hind limbs.  
- **Function:** Return blood from the legs to the heart.  

###5. Renal Veins###
- Connected to the kidneys.  
- **Function:** Return filtered blood to the heart.  

###6. Coronary Veins###
- Found around the heart.  
- **Function:** Drain deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle itself.  

##Function##
- **Return flow:** Carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.  
- **Recycling:** Bring carbon dioxide-rich blood to the lungs for oxygen exchange.  
- **Storage:** Hold most of the body’s blood volume at rest.  
- **Temperature balance:** Adjust blood return to regulate heat loss.

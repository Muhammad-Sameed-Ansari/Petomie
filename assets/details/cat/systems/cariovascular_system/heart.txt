#Heart#

##Location##
The heart is located in the **thoracic cavity**, between the lungs and slightly to the left side of the chest.  
It sits behind the sternum and is protected by the ribs.

##Shape##
The cat’s heart is a **cone-shaped, muscular organ** with four chambers: two atria (upper) and two ventricles (lower).  
It is roughly the size of a small walnut and enclosed in a thin, protective sac called the **pericardium**.

##Parts##

###1. Right Atrium###
- Receives oxygen-poor blood from the body through the veins.  

###2. Right Ventricle###
- Pumps blood to the lungs through the **pulmonary artery** to collect oxygen.  

###3. Left Atrium###
- Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.  

###4. Left Ventricle###
- The strongest chamber; pumps oxygenated blood through the **aorta** to the entire body.  

###5. Valves (Tricuspid, Pulmonary, Mitral, Aortic)###
- Prevent blood from flowing backward and keep circulation moving in one direction.  

###6. Pericardium###
- A protective membrane surrounding the heart.  
- **Function:** Reduces friction and holds the heart in position.  

##Function##
- **Circulation:** Pumps blood throughout the body.  
- **Oxygenation:** Sends oxygen-poor blood to the lungs and returns oxygen-rich blood to the body.  
- **Pressure control:** Maintains blood flow and pressure for all organs.  
- **Waste transport:** Helps remove carbon dioxide and other waste through circulation.

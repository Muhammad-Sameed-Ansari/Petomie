#Anal Sacs (Anal Glands)#

##Location##
The anal sacs are found just under the skin on each side of the anus, usually at the 4 o’clock and 8 o’clock positions. 
Each sac connects to the inside of the anus through a small duct that allows fluid to pass out naturally.

###Shape###
Two small oval sacs, each about the size of a pea, lined with special glands that produce a strong-smelling oily secretion.

##Function##
- Store and release a scented fluid that carries information about the cat’s identity, territory, and emotional state.
- Express naturally during defecation, fear, or excitement.
- Play an important role in scent communication between cats.
- Sometimes can become blocked or inflamed, leading to scooting or swelling.

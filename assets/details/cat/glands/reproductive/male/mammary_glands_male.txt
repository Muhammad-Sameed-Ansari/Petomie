#Mammary Glands (Male)#

Male cats possess mammary glands along the abdomen, just like females, but they are typically small and nonfunctional.  
Although they do not produce milk, they share the same basic structure and embryological origin.  
Energetically, they represent dormant nurturing potential, balance, and the quiet presence of compassion.

###Parts###

##Gland Lobes##  
Small clusters of inactive glandular tissue.  
Energetically, they symbolize latent nourishment and gentle potential.

##Milk Ducts##  
Underdeveloped ducts that do not carry milk in males.  
Energetically, they represent pathways of giving that remain internal or unexpressed.

##Nipples##  
External points shared by both sexes.  
Energetically, they embody connection, sensitivity, and subtle emotional awareness.

###Function###  
In male cats, mammary glands have no active lactation function but remain part of the reproductive anatomy.  
Energetically, they hold space for compassion, balance, and the softer aspects of masculine energy.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: hormonal shifts, inflammation, or stress.  
Masses: rare but possible due to hormonal influence.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect suppressed emotional expression or blocked gentle energy.

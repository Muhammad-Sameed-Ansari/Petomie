#Mammary Glands – Tom#

##Location##
In the male cat (tom), small rudimentary mammary glands are present along the same line as in females, from the chest to the groin area. 
They are non-functional and usually remain flat beneath the skin.

###Shape###
Tiny undeveloped gland areas beneath the nipples, without active ducts or secretory tissue.

##Function##
- Do not produce milk or secrete any fluid.
- Represent the embryonic connection between male and female development — both start with mammary structures before hormones define gender.
- Energetically, they symbolize balance between giving and receiving care.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Heart and Solar Plexus Chakras – compassion, confidence, and balance.
- **Meridian Connections:** Stomach and Governing Vessel Meridians.
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represent balanced masculine energy — strength paired with sensitivity. Imbalance may show as emotional withdrawal or over-dominance.
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm confidence and connected awareness.
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle interaction, bonding with companions, and peaceful rest balance heart and body energy.

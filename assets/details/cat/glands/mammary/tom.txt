#Mammary Glands (Tom)#

The tomcat’s mammary glands are small, undeveloped remnants of the same structures found in females.  
They do not produce milk but maintain basic sebaceous and connective tissues.  
Energetically, they represent balance, gentleness, and the seed of nurturing energy within masculine form.

###Parts###

##Gland Bases##  
Tiny, inactive lobes beneath the skin.  
Energetically, they symbolize potential and balance between masculine and feminine forces.

##Connective Tissue##  
Provides structure and support.  
Energetically, it represents grounding and inner stability.

##Nipple Area##  
Visible but functionally inactive.  
Energetically, it reflects harmony and latent sensitivity.

###Function###  
Though nonfunctional in milk production, male mammary glands maintain hormonal and structural balance.  
Energetically, they remind that nurturing and tenderness exist in all beings.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: hormonal irregularity or irritation.  
Infection: stress or inflammation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect unacknowledged emotional softness or imbalance between strength and care.

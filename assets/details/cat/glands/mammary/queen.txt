#Mammary Glands – Queen#

##Location##
In the female cat (queen), the mammary glands are located along the underside of the body, forming two parallel rows from the chest to the groin area. 
Most cats have four pairs (eight glands), though some may have fewer or more.

###Shape###
Small, soft glandular pads under the skin, which enlarge during pregnancy or nursing. 
Each gland has a nipple where milk is released.

##Function##
- Produce milk after giving birth to nourish kittens.
- Secrete colostrum immediately after birth, providing vital antibodies for immunity.
- Respond to hormonal changes during estrus, pregnancy, and nursing.
- Reflect the cat’s emotional comfort and maternal instinct — stress can reduce milk flow.

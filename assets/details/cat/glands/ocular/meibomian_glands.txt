#Tarsal Glands#

The cat’s tarsal glands, or Meibomian glands, are rows of oil-producing glands within the eyelids.  
They secrete lipids that form the tear film’s outer layer, preventing evaporation.  
Energetically, they represent boundaries, balance, and protection of clarity.

###Parts###

##Gland Rows##  
Parallel oil-producing lines along each eyelid.  
Energetically, they symbolize stability and calm order.

##Duct Openings##  
Tiny pores at the lid margin.  
Energetically, they represent flow and openness.

##Eyelid Margin##  
Protects and smooths the eye surface.  
Energetically, it reflects resilience and healthy emotional boundaries.

###Function###  
Tarsal glands stabilize tears, protect from dryness, and maintain smooth blinking.  
Energetically, they support balance, peace, and inner harmony.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blocked glands: stagnation or stress.  
Dryness: lack of flow or rigidity.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect boundary strain or inner imbalance.

#Parathyroid Glands#

The cat’s parathyroid glands are small, paired glands behind the thyroid.  
They regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism for muscle and nerve health.  
Energetically, they represent **stability, structure, and strength**.

###Parts###

##Chief Cells##  
Produce parathyroid hormone (PTH).  
Energetically, they symbolize steady leadership and grounded focus.

##Oxyphil Cells##  
Support hormone activity.  
Energetically, they represent resilience and endurance.

##Connective Capsule##  
Protects and anchors the gland.  
Energetically, it reflects support and containment.

###Function###  
Parathyroid glands maintain calcium balance and bone health.  
Energetically, they sustain stability and inner foundation.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivity: muscle tension, anxiety.  
Underactivity: weakness, fatigue.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of grounding or inner imbalance**.

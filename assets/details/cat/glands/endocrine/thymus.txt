#Thymus#

The cat’s thymus is a soft, lobed gland located in the upper chest, just in front of the heart.  
It plays a crucial role in early life by developing and training immune cells, especially T-lymphocytes.  
Energetically, it represents vitality, protection, and the heart–immune connection — the bridge between emotional well-being and physical defense.

###Parts###

##Cortex##  
The outer region where immature immune cells develop.  
Energetically, it symbolizes growth, learning, and strengthening boundaries.

##Medulla##  
The inner region where T-cells mature and become specialized.  
Energetically, it represents clarity, purpose, and refined protection.

##Thymic Lobules##  
Small compartments that organize immune development.  
Energetically, they reflect structure, guidance, and orderly inner processes.

###Function###  
The thymus trains T-cells, builds immunity, and protects the young cat from infections.  
It supports long-term immune memory and resilience.  
Energetically, it strengthens courage, emotional openness, and the ability to stay protected yet connected.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakened immunity: frequent infections or slow recovery.  
Underdevelopment: reduced immune strength in young cats.  
Atrophy with age: natural shrinking leading to reduced T-cell output.  
Energetically, imbalance may show as emotional vulnerability, difficulty setting boundaries, or sensitivity to stress.

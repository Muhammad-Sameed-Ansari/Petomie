#Ceruminous Glands#

The cat’s ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands in the ear canal.  
They produce cerumen (earwax) that protects the ears from debris and infection.  
Energetically, they represent intuition, listening, and awareness.

###Parts###

##Sebaceous Cells##  
Add oils to keep earwax soft.  
Energetically, they symbolize balance and sensitivity.

##Apocrine Units##  
Secrete waxy protective material.  
Energetically, they reflect intuitive perception and self-trust.

##Ear Canal Lining##  
Directs wax outward for natural cleaning.  
Energetically, it represents openness to truth.

###Function###  
Ceruminous glands trap dust, protect from infection, and support hearing.  
Energetically, they help balance inner and outer awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Wax buildup: emotional clutter or overstimulation.  
Dryness: disconnection or fear of hearing inner guidance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect resistance to intuition.

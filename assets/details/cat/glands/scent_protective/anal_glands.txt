#Anal Glands#

The cat’s anal glands are paired scent glands on each side of the anus.  
They secrete pheromones used for territory marking and communication.  
Energetically, they represent boundaries, grounding, and self-definition.

###Parts###

##Ducts##  
Openings near the anus where secretion is released.  
Energetically, they represent clarity and direction.

##Muscle Support##  
Contracts during defecation to empty the glands.  
Energetically, it reflects strength and healthy release.

###Function###  
Anal glands communicate identity, territory, and emotional state through scent.  
Energetically, they help maintain balance between openness and protection.

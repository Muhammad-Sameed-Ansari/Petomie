#Tracheal Glands#

The cat’s tracheal glands are distributed along the walls of the windpipe.  
They produce mucus and serous fluid to moisten and protect the airway.  
Energetically, they represent communication, flow, and alignment of breath and expression.

###Parts###

##Submucosal Glands##  
Located beneath the tracheal lining, secreting protective mucus.  
Energetically, they symbolize emotional buffering and calmness.

##Ducts##  
Deliver secretions to the airway surface.  
Energetically, they represent pathways of clear expression.

##Ciliated Epithelium##  
Works with secretions to trap and move particles outward.  
Energetically, it reflects rhythm, cooperation, and protection.

###Function###  
Tracheal glands keep the airway moist, remove irritants, and support smooth breathing.  
Energetically, they sustain open communication and emotional ease.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess mucus: irritation or emotional overload.  
Dryness: suppressed expression or dehydration.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty communicating or constricted breath.

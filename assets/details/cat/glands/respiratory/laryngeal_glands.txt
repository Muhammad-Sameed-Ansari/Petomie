#Laryngeal Glands#

The cat’s laryngeal glands are small mucus-secreting glands located within the tissues of the larynx.  
They lubricate the vocal folds and protect the airway during breathing and vocalization.  
Energetically, they represent voice, expression, and authenticity.

Moisten the vocal cords to maintain flexibility and sound production.  
Energetically, they represent free self-expression and emotional honesty.

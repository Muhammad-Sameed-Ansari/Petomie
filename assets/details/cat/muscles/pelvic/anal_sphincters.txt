#Anal Sphincters#

The cat’s anal sphincters are circular muscles surrounding the anus that control defecation and maintain continence.  
They provide both voluntary and involuntary control, ensuring precise function and protection of the lower digestive tract.  
Energetically, they represent **control, release, and balance between holding and letting go**.

###Parts###

##External Anal Sphincter##  
A voluntary skeletal muscle encircling the anus, controlling conscious release.  
Energetically, symbolizes **boundaries, discipline, and mastery of flow**.

##Internal Anal Sphincter##  
An involuntary smooth muscle that maintains closure and tone.  
Energetically, reflects **trust, subconscious regulation, and safety**.

##Perianal Support Fibers##  
Assist with subtle contraction and relaxation during elimination.  
Energetically, embody **stability and flow between effort and surrender**.

###Function###  
The anal sphincters maintain closure of the anus, assist in defecation, and protect against leakage.  
Energetically, they balance **control with release**, mirroring emotional and physical harmony in letting go.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: constipation or energetic withholding.  
Weakness: incontinence or lack of control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **resistance to release or fear of loss of control**.

#Perineal Muscle#

The cat’s perineal muscles form a small but vital group located around the anus and genital region.  
They control tail movement, defecation, and reproductive actions, supporting pelvic stability.  
Energetically, they represent **release, grounding, and control of vital flow** — linking physical and energetic elimination.

##Coccygeus Muscle##

###Function###  
The perineal muscles assist in tail motion, pelvic stability, and elimination.  
They connect the spine to the pelvic outlet, maintaining strength and flexibility in this region.  
Energetically, they balance **control and surrender**, grounding the flow of life force energy.

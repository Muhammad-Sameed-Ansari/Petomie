#Neck Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the **cervical region** between the head, thorax, and shoulders.  
These muscles form the structural and functional connection between the **head and trunk**, enabling mobility, posture, and sensory orientation.

##Shape##
Composed of **slender, layered, and flexible muscles** that allow fine motor control of the head and neck.  
The cat’s neck muscles are more compact and agile than in larger animals, providing both **strength and precision** for hunting, grooming, and balance.

##Parts##

###1. Brachiocephalicus###
Long, strap-like muscle extending from the head and neck to the humerus.  
- Pulls the forelimb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally when one side contracts  
- Assists in extending the shoulder joint  

###2. Sternocephalicus###
Extends from the sternum to the head.  
- Flexes the head and neck ventrally  
- Turns the head to one side  

###3. Splenius###
Broad, flat muscle covering the upper neck.  
- Extends and elevates the head and neck  
- Acts unilaterally to bend the neck laterally  

###4. Semispinalis Capitis###
Deep dorsal muscle connecting the upper thoracic vertebrae to the skull.  
- Raises and extends the head  
- Stabilizes the neck during movement  

###5. Longus Colli###
Deep muscle along the ventral cervical vertebrae.  
- Flexes the neck downward  
- Stabilizes the cervical vertebral column  

###6. Trapezius (Cervical Part)###
Superficial triangular sheet covering the lateral neck.  
- Elevates and advances the scapula  
- Assists in forelimb movement  

###7. Rhomboideus###
Lies deep to the trapezius, from cervical vertebrae to scapula.  
- Elevates and rotates the scapula  
- Supports the shoulder girdle  

###8. Omotransversarius###
Slender band extending from the atlas to the acromion of the scapula.  
- Pulls the limb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally  

###9. Serratus Ventralis (Cervical Part)###
Fan-shaped muscle connecting cervical vertebrae to the scapula.  
- Supports the trunk between the forelimbs  
- Helps elevate the neck and stabilize the shoulder  

###10. Nuchal Ligament (Associated Structure)###
Elastic ligament connecting the cervical vertebrae to the skull.  
- Supports the head’s weight  
- Allows smooth and energy-efficient neck movement  

##Function##
- Controls **head and neck movements** for hunting, balance, and grooming  
- Maintains **posture and spinal stability** during motion  
- Assists in **forelimb movement and coordination**  
- Provides **fine-tuned motion** for sensory and predatory behaviors  
- Supports **flexion, extension, and lateral bending** of the neck

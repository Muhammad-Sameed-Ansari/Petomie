#Mastication Muscles#

##Location##
Located around the **jaw and cheek region**, connecting the **mandible, maxilla, zygomatic arch, and temporal bones**.  
These muscles control **chewing and biting movements**, allowing the cat to grasp, tear, and grind food efficiently.

##Shape##
Composed of **thick, powerful, and layered muscles**, designed to generate strong jaw-closing force.  
They have short fibers and broad attachments to provide both **precision and strength** during feeding and grooming.

##Parts##

###1. Masseter###
Large, superficial muscle on the lateral side of the face.  
- Origin: zygomatic arch  
- Insertion: lateral surface of mandible  
- **Function:** Elevates the mandible, closes the jaw, and provides the main chewing power.  

###2. Temporalis###
Broad, fan-shaped muscle covering the temporal region of the skull.  
- Origin: temporal fossa of skull  
- Insertion: coronoid process of the mandible  
- **Function:** Elevates and retracts the mandible; assists in powerful biting.  

###3. Medial Pterygoid###
Located on the inner side of the mandible.  
- Origin: pterygoid fossa of skull  
- Insertion: medial surface of the mandible  
- **Function:** Elevates and moves the mandible laterally for grinding motion.  

###4. Lateral Pterygoid###
Smaller muscle situated deep in the jaw region.  
- Origin: sphenoid bone  
- Insertion: neck of mandible and temporomandibular joint capsule  
- **Function:** Pulls the mandible forward and side-to-side; assists in opening the mouth.  

###5. Digastricus###
Paired muscle located along the ventral jaw.  
- Origin: paracondylar process of occipital bone  
- Insertion: mandible (caudal border)  
- **Function:** Opens the mouth by depressing the mandible; acts opposite to the masseter and temporalis.  

##Function##
- **Chewing:** Raises and lowers the jaw to grind, tear, and crush food.  
- **Biting:** Generates strong jaw closure for gripping prey or food.  
- **Lateral movement:** Enables small side-to-side jaw motion for efficient mastication.  
- **Stabilization:** Maintains jaw alignment and tension during grooming or vocalization.  
- **Coordination:** Works with facial and tongue muscles for controlled eating and swallowing.

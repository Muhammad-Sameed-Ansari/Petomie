They attach primarily to the skin, allowing subtle movements that express emotions, aid in communication, and enhance sensory perception.

##Shape##
Composed of **thin, flat, and delicate muscles** arranged in circular and radiating patterns around facial openings.  
Their intricate interconnections enable **fine motor control** for whisker movement, ear positioning, and mouth expression.

#External Intercostal Muscles#

The external intercostal muscles lie between the ribs, assisting inspiration by lifting and expanding the ribcage.  
They work in coordination with the diaphragm to draw air into the lungs.  
Energetically, they represent openness, inspiration, and flow of new ideas.

###Parts###

##Intercostal Fibers##  
Run obliquely between adjacent ribs, lifting them during inhalation.  
Energetically, they symbolize growth and expansion.

##Costal Attachments##  
Secure the ribs and maintain thoracic structure.  
Energetically, they reflect stability during movement.

###Function###  
These muscles expand the chest during inhalation, increasing lung capacity.  
Energetically, they awaken creativity and openness to life.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: tension or shallow breathing.  
Weakness: decreased breath depth.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitation or suppressed inspiration.

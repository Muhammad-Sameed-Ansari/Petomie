#Serratus Dorsalis Cranialis#

The cat’s serratus dorsalis cranialis lies on the upper back and aids in inspiration by lifting the ribs.  
It works in coordination with the diaphragm and intercostals to expand the thoracic cavity.  
Energetically, it represents renewal, breath of life, and upward movement.

###Parts###

##Cranial Fibers##  
Attach to the first ribs to assist inhalation.  
Energetically, symbolize clarity and uplifting energy.

##Fascial Attachments##  
Connect to the thoracolumbar fascia for stability.  
Energetically, reflect support and flow.

###Function###  
This muscle enhances rib elevation during inhalation, expanding lung capacity.  
Energetically, it embodies inspiration and renewal of energy.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted breathing.  
Weakness: poor rib elevation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect fatigue or lack of inspiration.

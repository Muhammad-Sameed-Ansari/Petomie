#Diaphragm#

The diaphragm forms the muscular partition between the thoracic and abdominal cavities.  
It is the primary muscle of inspiration, drawing air into the lungs by expanding the chest cavity.  
Energetically, it represents flow, expansion, and the rhythm of life between giving and receiving.

###Parts###

##Crura##  
Attach the diaphragm to the lumbar vertebrae.  
Energetically, they symbolize deep grounding and strength from within.

##Costal Portion##  
Connects to the ribs and lifts during inhalation.  
Energetically, it reflects openness and flexibility.

##Sternal Portion##  
Anchors the diaphragm to the sternum.  
Energetically, it represents the bridge between stability and movement.

###Function###  
The diaphragm contracts to pull air into the lungs and relaxes during exhalation.  
Energetically, it harmonizes body and spirit through the breath’s rhythm.

###Common Imbalances###  
Spasm: shallow or restricted breathing.  
Weakness: fatigue or reduced oxygen exchange.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect anxiety or emotional stagnation.

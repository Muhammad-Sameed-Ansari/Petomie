#Scalenus Muscles#

The scalenus muscles are located along the lower neck, connecting cervical vertebrae to the first ribs.  
They assist with the first stage of inhalation, lifting the upper ribs to initiate breath.  
Energetically, they represent awakening, clarity, and the bridge between thought and breath.

###Parts###

##Scalenus Dorsalis##  
Lifts the first ribs during inhalation.  
Energetically, it symbolizes the rise of new awareness.

##Scalenus Medius##  
Stabilizes the upper ribs.  
Energetically, it reflects calm strength and balance.

##Scalenus Ventralis##  
Supports fine control of breathing rhythm.  
Energetically, it represents gentle flow and adaptability.

###Function###  
The scalenus muscles coordinate with the diaphragm and intercostals to start the breath cycle.  
Energetically, they awaken the flow of energy through breath, linking the physical and mental realms.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: restricted upper breathing.  
Weakness: reduced lift and flow.  
Neck tightness: imbalance between control and release.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect mental stress or suppressed clarity.

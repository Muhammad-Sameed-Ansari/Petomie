#Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis#

The cat’s serratus dorsalis caudalis lies along the upper back and aids in exhalation by pulling the ribs downward.  
It supports the rhythmic contraction of the thoracic wall.  
Energetically, it represents **transition, release, and alignment with natural cycles**.

###Parts###

##Caudal Fibers##  
Attach to the last few ribs to assist exhalation.  
Energetically, symbolize **closure and grounding**.

##Aponeurotic Sheet##  
Connects to the thoracolumbar fascia, transferring force evenly.  
Energetically, reflects **stability through transformation**.

###Function###  
This muscle works in rhythm with the diaphragm and intercostals to complete exhalation.  
Energetically, it helps **synchronize breath with emotional flow**, fostering calmness and renewal.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: shallow or irregular breathing.  
Weakness: reduced rib mobility.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **difficulty in letting go or completing cycles**.

#Internal Intercostal Muscles#

The cat’s internal intercostal muscles lie between the ribs, pulling them inward during exhalation.  
They work in opposition to the external intercostals, completing the breathing rhythm.  
Energetically, they represent **inner reflection, release, and balance between effort and rest**.

###Parts###

##Intercostal Fibers##  
Run diagonally between ribs, drawing them closer during exhalation.  
Energetically, symbolize **cooperation and inward flow**.

##Costal Attachments##  
Anchor along rib edges for stability.  
Energetically, represent **structure within transformation**.

###Function###  
These muscles coordinate exhalation by reducing rib space and controlling breath flow.  
Energetically, they align **physical release with emotional balance**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: shallow breathing or chest restriction.  
Weakness: reduced breath control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **suppressed emotion or inner resistance**.

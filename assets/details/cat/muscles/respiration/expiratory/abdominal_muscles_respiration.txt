#Abdominal Muscles of Respiration#

The cat’s abdominal muscles assist in exhalation by compressing the abdomen and supporting the diaphragm’s upward motion.  
They create internal pressure to expel air and stabilize the trunk during breathing.  
Energetically, they represent **release, grounding, and rhythm in life’s cycles**.

###Parts###

##Rectus Abdominis##  
Contracts to push air out during forceful exhalation.  
Energetically, symbolizes **focused release and internal strength**.

##External Oblique##  
Compresses the ribs and abdomen.  
Energetically, reflects **flow and conscious letting go**.

##Internal Oblique##  
Supports the lower ribs and coordinates core contraction.  
Energetically, represents **integration and emotional release**.

##Transversus Abdominis##  
Provides deep stability during exhalation.  
Energetically, embodies **inner calm and centered rhythm**.

###Function###  
These muscles work with the diaphragm to regulate breathing depth and strength.  
Energetically, they balance **inhalation’s expansion with exhalation’s surrender**, restoring inner harmony.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: shallow breathing or stress.  
Weakness: poor exhalation control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **resistance to release or emotional stagnation**.

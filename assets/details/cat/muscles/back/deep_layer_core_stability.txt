#Deep Layer (Core Stability and Alignment)#

##Location##
Located deep within the **abdominal, spinal, and pelvic regions** of the cat.  
These muscles form the **inner core**, surrounding the spine and supporting posture, balance, and coordinated movement.  
They lie beneath the outer muscle layers, connecting the **pelvis, spine, and ribcage**.

##Shape##
Composed of **small, dense, and layered muscles** arranged close to the vertebral column and pelvic bones.  
They are less visible externally but provide essential **stability and fine control** of body movement and alignment.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidus###
- Series of short muscles running along the spine from the sacrum to the neck.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes individual vertebrae, aids fine spinal movement, and maintains posture.

###2. Transversus Abdominis###
- Deepest abdominal layer wrapping around the abdomen like a belt.  
- **Function:** Compresses abdominal contents and supports spinal alignment during motion.

###3. Psoas Major###
- Extends from the lumbar vertebrae to the femur.  
- **Function:** Flexes the hip and stabilizes the lower back and pelvis during walking or jumping.

###4. Iliacus###
- Lies next to the psoas, joining it at the hip.  
- **Function:** Aids in hip flexion and supports pelvic alignment.

###5. Quadratus Lumborum###
- Runs between the pelvis and lumbar spine.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes lower spine and helps control side bending.

###6. Diaphragm###
- Dome-shaped muscle separating chest and abdomen.  
- **Function:** Supports breathing and helps stabilize the core during movement.

##Function##
- **Core Stability:** Keeps spine and pelvis aligned during movement and rest.  
- **Postural Support:** Maintains balance during crouching, jumping, and landing.  
- **Movement Coordination:** Links upper and lower body movement for agility.  
- **Protection:** Shields internal organs by maintaining abdominal tension.  
- **Breathing Integration:** Works with diaphragm and abdomen for smooth respiration and movement.

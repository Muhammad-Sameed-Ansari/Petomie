#Superficial Layer (Movement and Power)#

##Location##
Forms the **outermost muscle layer** of the cat’s body, covering the trunk, limbs, and neck.  
These muscles are responsible for **visible movement, strength, and speed**.

##Shape##
Made of **large, long, and powerful muscles** that produce most of the cat’s locomotor force.  
They are arranged along the limbs and body surface, contributing to agility and explosive movement.

##Parts##

###1. Trapezius###
- Thin, triangular muscle over the neck and shoulder.  
- **Function:** Elevates and rotates the scapula during limb movement.  

###2. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Broad muscle covering the side and back.  
- **Function:** Pulls the forelimb backward and aids in climbing or jumping.  

###3. Gluteal Muscles###
- Located over the hip region.  
- **Function:** Extend the hip and drive propulsion during running or jumping.  

###4. Quadriceps Femoris###
- Large muscle group on the front of the thigh.  
- **Function:** Extends the stifle (knee) and supports weight during standing or leaping.  

###5. Hamstring Group (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus)###
- Along the back of the thigh.  
- **Function:** Extend the hip and propel the body forward.  

###6. Pectoral Muscles###
- Chest muscles connecting forelimb to sternum.  
- **Function:** Adduct the limb and assist in weight support and movement.  

##Function##
- **Movement and Power:** Generates strength for walking, running, and jumping.  
- **Propulsion:** Drives the body forward using large limb and back muscles.  
- **Agility:** Enables quick directional changes and balance recovery.  
- **Strength Integration:** Works with intermediate and deep layers for coordinated motion.

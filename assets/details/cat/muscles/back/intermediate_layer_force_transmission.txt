#Intermediate Layer Force Transmission#

The cat’s intermediate muscular layer links the deep stabilizers with the outer movement muscles.  
It transfers force smoothly through the body, coordinating strength and flexibility.  
Energetically, it represents **flow, cooperation, and balanced expression of power**.

###Parts###

##Oblique Muscles##  
Guide rotation and side-bending of the trunk.  
Energetically, symbolize **adaptability and graceful change**.

##Mid-Back and Flank Muscles##  
Bridge ribs, spine, and pelvis for efficient force transfer.  
Energetically, reflect **connection and harmonious movement**.

##Linking Fascia##  
Binds layers together for unified action.  
Energetically, embodies **integration and energetic continuity**.

###Function###  
Distributes load between core and limbs, enabling fluid, efficient motion.  
Energetically, it aligns **inner strength with outward action**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted rotation or stiffness.  
Weakness: inefficient movement or early fatigue.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **blocked flow or difficulty adapting**.

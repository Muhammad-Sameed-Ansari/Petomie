#Intermediate Layer (Force Transmission and Coordination)#

##Location##
Situated between the **deep core muscles** and the **outer movement muscles**, the intermediate layer connects the **spine, ribs, and pelvis** to the limbs.  
It serves as the **bridge between stability and motion**, ensuring smooth energy transfer during movement.

##Shape##
Composed of **medium-depth muscles** that run diagonally or longitudinally across the trunk.  
They link major joints and muscle groups, supporting balanced coordination between front and hind limbs.

##Parts##

###1. Internal Oblique###
- Lies beneath the external oblique on the abdomen.  
- **Function:** Rotates and flexes the trunk; helps transfer force between limbs.  

###2. Longissimus Dorsi###
- Long muscle along the spine, connecting sacrum to neck.  
- **Function:** Extends and stabilizes the back; transfers propulsive force from hindquarters to forelimbs.  

###3. Iliocostalis###
- Runs from the pelvis to the ribs.  
- **Function:** Maintains posture and aids lateral bending of the body.  

###4. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Broad, flat muscle along the side of the body.  
- **Function:** Retracts the forelimb and assists in climbing or stretching.  

###5. External Oblique###
- Outermost abdominal layer covering the sides of the body.  
- **Function:** Compresses the abdomen and assists in trunk flexion and rotation.  

##Function##
- **Force Transmission:** Channels movement energy between the hindlimbs and forelimbs.  
- **Coordination:** Synchronizes spine, limb, and trunk actions during walking or running.  
- **Posture Control:** Maintains trunk alignment and flexibility.  
- **Support:** Reinforces deep core stability and assists outer movement layers.

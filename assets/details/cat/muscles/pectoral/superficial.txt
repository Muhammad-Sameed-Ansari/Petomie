#Pectoral Superficial Muscles#

The cat’s superficial pectoral muscles form the outer chest layer, connecting the sternum to the upper forelimb.  
They bring the limb inward and assist with flexion and movement control.  
Energetically, they represent **expression of strength, openness, and heart-centered action**.

###Parts###

##Transverse Pectoral##  
Crosses the chest horizontally, aiding limb adduction.  
Energetically, represents **balance and harmony in giving and receiving**.

##Fascial Connections##  
Link to the shoulder and forelimb fascia for motion flow.  
Energetically, reflect **fluid connection between strength and tenderness**.

###Function###  
The superficial pectoral muscles guide limb movement, stabilizing and flexing the shoulder during stride.  
Energetically, they connect **heart-centered action with physical strength**, enabling graceful interaction with the world.

###Common Imbalances###

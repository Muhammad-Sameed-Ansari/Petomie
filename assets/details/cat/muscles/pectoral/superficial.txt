#Superficial Pectoral Muscles#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral chest** between the forelimbs, covering the **cranial and middle parts of the sternum** and extending toward the **humerus**.  
Composed of two parts — the **descending pectoral** and the **transverse pectoral** — which form the superficial layer of the feline chest musculature.

###Shape###
Broad, thin, flat muscles forming a muscular sheet across the front of the chest.  
The descending pectoral runs obliquely from the cranial sternum upward and laterally to the humerus, while the transverse pectoral runs more horizontally across the lower thorax.  
The fibers converge toward the upper arm and fuse medially with their counterparts from the opposite side.

##Function##
Adduct the forelimbs toward the body midline and stabilize the shoulder joint during locomotion.  
Assist in **protraction and retraction** of the limb depending on limb position.  
When the forelimb is fixed, they help **draw the trunk forward** during walking or running.  
Contribute to **weight-bearing support**, **balance control**, and **shock absorption** during movement.  
Work synergistically with the **deep pectoral** to provide coordinated limb and thoracic motion.  
Also aid fine **postural adjustments** and stabilization of the scapulohumeral region during grooming, climbing, or crouching behaviors.

#Deep Pectoral Muscle (Ascending Pectoral)#

##Location##
Situated beneath the superficial pectorals, originating from the **entire length of the sternum** and inserting onto the **greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus**.  
Forms the deeper muscular layer of the feline ventral thorax, positioned between the forelimbs and extending caudally along the chest floor.

###Shape###
Thick, fan-shaped muscle with a broad sternal origin and narrow humeral insertion.  
Fibers run upward and laterally from the sternum, forming a strong ascending pattern.  
Highly elastic and powerful, enabling forward propulsion and chest stabilization.

##Function##
Retracts the forelimb and adducts it toward the body’s midline during the stride.  
When the limb is fixed, the muscle **draws the trunk forward**, contributing to propulsion and climbing actions.  
Assists in **stabilizing the shoulder and sternum** during locomotion and posture.  
Provides **strength and support** for crouching, jumping, or pouncing, where strong limb retraction and trunk motion are required.  
Works together with the superficial pectorals and **serratus ventralis** to maintain **trunk suspension** and thoracic balance between the limbs.  
Also helps **absorb landing impact** and **control thoracic compression** during fast motion or stretching.

#Pectoral Deep Muscles#

The cat’s deep pectoral muscles lie beneath the superficial layer, attaching the sternum to the humerus.  
They draw the limb backward and stabilize the shoulder during motion.  
Energetically, they represent **inner strength, grounded power, and trust in support**.

###Parts###

##Deep Pectoral (Ascending Pectoral)##  
Pulls the forelimb backward and inward.  
Energetically, symbolizes **inner drive and rooted determination**.

##Sternal Fibers##  
Connect deeply to the sternum for strong leverage.  
Energetically, reflect **connection to core values and emotional balance**.

##Tendinous Attachments##  
Link to the humerus and shoulder fascia for stability.  
Energetically, embody **security and structural integrity**.

###Function###  
The deep pectoral muscles stabilize the shoulder and draw the limb toward the body.  
They support pushing and weight-bearing actions.  
Energetically, they provide **inner stability and confidence in grounded movement**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted shoulder motion.  
Weakness: reduced pulling strength.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of grounding or inner tension**.

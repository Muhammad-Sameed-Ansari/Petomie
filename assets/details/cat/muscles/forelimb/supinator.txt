#Supinator Muscle#

The cat’s **supinator muscle** lies on the **lateral aspect of the forearm**, encircling the upper part of the **radius**.  
It plays an important role in **rotating the paw upward (supination)**, allowing the cat to perform its characteristic grooming, grasping, and hunting motions with precision.  
Energetically, it represents **agility, flexibility, and readiness to respond**.

###Location###  
Found on the **outer side of the elbow and upper forearm**, beneath the **extensor carpi radialis** and **common digital extensor** muscles.

###Attachments###  
- **Origin:** Lateral epicondyle of the humerus.  
- **Insertion:** Proximal radius (cranial and medial surfaces).  
- **Associated Structures:** Radial collateral ligament, joint capsule of the elbow.

###Shape###  
A broad, fan-like muscle that spirals around the upper radius, creating smooth and flexible movement.  
Its fibers are fine and responsive, supporting precise control and forelimb dexterity.

###Parts###  

##Superficial Fibers##  
Control the initial outward rotation of the radius during paw supination.  
Energetically, they represent **active awareness and responsive readiness**.

##Deep Fibers##  
Stabilize the elbow joint and maintain rotational balance under pressure.  
Energetically, they embody **focused calm and steady control**.

###Function###  
- Rotates the **forearm and paw upward (supination)**.  
- Stabilizes the elbow joint during flexion and weight transfer.  
- Enhances coordination for grasping and grooming.  
Energetically, the supinator muscle aligns **movement with precision and fluid expression**, guiding awareness through touch and motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted forearm rotation or stiffness during grooming.  
Weakness: decreased control during grasping or balance loss.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **resistance to change or lack of fluid responsiveness**.

#Trapezius Muscles#

The cat’s trapezius muscles lie along the upper back and neck, connecting the spine to the scapula.  
They stabilize and move the shoulder blade, aiding in forelimb elevation and extension.  
Energetically, they represent **responsibility, freedom, and balance between effort and ease**.

###Parts###

##Cervical Trapezius##  
Extends from the neck to the scapula, lifting and rotating the shoulder.  
Energetically, symbolizes **alertness and readiness for action**.

##Thoracic Trapezius##  
Runs from the thoracic spine to the scapula, drawing it backward.  
Energetically, reflects **support and grounded strength**.

###Function###  
The trapezius muscles elevate, stabilize, and rotate the scapula, supporting forelimb motion.  
Energetically, they balance **burden and freedom, helping the cat maintain grace under pressure**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: neck or shoulder tension.  
Weakness: reduced limb lift or shoulder instability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **over-responsibility or suppressed freedom**.

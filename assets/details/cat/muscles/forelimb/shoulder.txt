#Shoulder Muscles#

##Location##
Located around the **scapula and proximal humerus**, forming the connection between the trunk and the forelimb.  
These muscles stabilize the shoulder joint, control limb movement, and support body weight during standing, walking, and climbing.

##Shape##
Composed of **broad, flat, and fan-shaped muscles**, with deeper spindle-shaped stabilizers.  
They surround the scapula laterally, medially, and dorsally, allowing both powerful and precise motion of the limb.

##Parts##

###1. Deltoideus###
- Divided into acromial and scapular parts.  
- Origin: spine and acromion of the scapula.  
- Insertion: deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Flexes the shoulder and abducts the forelimb.  

###2. Supraspinatus###
- Occupies the supraspinous fossa of the scapula.  
- Insertion: greater tubercle of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Extends and stabilizes the shoulder joint.  

###3. Infraspinatus###
- Located in the infraspinous fossa of the scapula.  
- Insertion: lateral aspect of greater tubercle of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Flexes, extends, and stabilizes the shoulder; rotates the limb laterally.  

###4. Subscapularis###
- Lies on the medial surface of the scapula.  
- Insertion: lesser tubercle of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Adducts and stabilizes the shoulder; rotates limb medially.  

###5. Teres Major###
- Caudal to the subscapularis.  
- Origin: caudal border of the scapula.  
- Insertion: teres major tuberosity on humerus.  
- **Function:** Flexes and rotates the shoulder medially.  

###6. Teres Minor###
- Small muscle located caudal to the infraspinatus.  
- Origin: caudal border of the scapula.  
- Insertion: teres minor tuberosity.  
- **Function:** Flexes and rotates the shoulder laterally.  

###7. Coracobrachialis###
- Small, spindle-shaped muscle on the medial aspect of the shoulder.  
- Origin: coracoid process of the scapula.  
- Insertion: proximal medial humerus.  
- **Function:** Adducts and stabilizes the shoulder joint.  

###8. Trapezius (Cervical and Thoracic Parts)###
- Large superficial muscle over the neck and shoulder.  
- Elevates, abducts, and advances the scapula.  

###9. Omotransversarius###
- Extends from atlas to acromion.  
- Advances the limb and flexes the neck laterally.  

###10. Rhomboideus###
- Deep to trapezius, connecting scapula to spine.  
- Elevates the scapula and supports the limb.  

###11. Serratus Ventralis###
- Large fan-shaped muscle attaching scapula to ribs.  
- Supports trunk and acts as a sling between forelimbs.  

##Function##
- **Flexion and extension of shoulder joint:** by deltoideus, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres group.  
- **Rotation of limb:** infraspinatus and teres minor (lateral), subscapularis and teres major (medial).  
- **Adduction and stabilization:** subscapularis, coracobrachialis, serratus ventralis.  
- **Support and elevation:** trapezius, rhomboideus, and serratus ventralis maintain scapular stability during movement.

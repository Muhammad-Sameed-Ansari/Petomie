#Antebrachium Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **elbow and carpus (wrist)**, forming the middle section of the forelimb.  
These muscles control **flexion and extension** of the carpus and digits, and also assist in **rotation and stabilization** of the forearm.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, strap-like and tendinous muscles** arranged into **cranial (extensor)** and **caudal (flexor)** groups.  
Their elongated tendons continue into the manus to control precise paw and claw movements.

##Parts##

###Cranial (Extensor) Group###

###1. Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus & Brevis###
- Located on the dorsolateral surface of the forearm.  
- **Function:** Extend the carpus and stabilize the wrist during limb extension.  

###2. Common Digital Extensor###
- Runs along the dorsal midline of the forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends the carpus and digits II–V.  

###3. Lateral Digital Extensor###
- Lies lateral to the common digital extensor.  
- **Function:** Extends digits III–V independently.  

###4. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (Ulnaris Lateralis)###
- On the caudolateral side of the forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends or flexes the carpus depending on limb position.  

###5. Supinator###
- Short, broad muscle wrapping around the proximal radius.  
- **Function:** Rotates the paw laterally (supination).

###Caudal (Flexor) Group###

###6. Flexor Carpi Radialis###
- Medial forearm surface.  
- **Function:** Flexes the carpus and stabilizes the forelimb.  

###7. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris###
- Consists of humeral and ulnar heads.  
- **Function:** Flexes the carpus and aids in weight support.  

###8. Superficial Digital Flexor###
- Lies between the two carpal flexors.  
- **Function:** Flexes the carpus and proximal interphalangeal joints of digits II–V.  

###9. Deep Digital Flexor###
- Deepest flexor; has three heads inserting on the distal phalanges.  
- **Function:** Flexes all digital joints and retracts claws.  

###10. Pronator Teres###
- Small, oblique muscle on the medial side of the elbow.  
- **Function:** Rotates the paw medially (pronation).  

###11. Pronator Quadratus###
- Flat muscle between radius and ulna.  
- **Function:** Maintains pronation and stabilizes the forearm bones.

##Function##
- **Extension:** Performed by dorsal muscles (extensors).  
- **Flexion:** Performed by ventral muscles (flexors).  
- **Rotation:** Supinator and pronator muscles rotate the paw for grooming and precision.  
- **Stabilization:** Maintains carpal and digital joint integrity during locomotion and weight-bearing.

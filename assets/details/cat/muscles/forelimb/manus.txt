#Manus Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **distal portion of the forelimb**, below the carpus (wrist).  
These muscles and tendons extend into the **digits (toes)** and **palm**, providing control for grasping, claw movement, and fine motor actions.

##Shape##
Composed of **small, elongated, and tendinous muscles** arranged in superficial and deep layers.  
They include both **extensor** and **flexor** groups, which act antagonistically to control digital and carpal movement.  
The arrangement allows precision, grip, and retraction of claws unique to felines.

##Parts##

###1. Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus & Brevis###
- Located on the dorsal surface of the forearm.  
- Extend the carpus and stabilize the wrist during extension.  

###2. Common Digital Extensor###
- Lies along the dorsal midline of the antebrachium.  
- Inserts on distal phalanges of digits II–V.  
- Extends the carpus and digits simultaneously.  

###3. Lateral Digital Extensor###
- Runs lateral to the common digital extensor.  
- Inserts on digits III–V.  
- Extends these digits independently for controlled movement.  

###4. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (Ulnaris Lateralis)###
- Found on the lateral side of the forearm.  
- Extends or flexes the carpus depending on joint position.  

###5. Abductor Pollicis Longus###
- Lies obliquely across the distal radius and ulna.  
- Abducts and extends the first digit (thumb).  

###6. Flexor Carpi Radialis###
- Medial side of the forearm.  
- Flexes the carpus and stabilizes the limb during locomotion.  

###7. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris###
- Composed of humeral and ulnar heads.  
- Flexes the carpus and assists in weight support.  

###8. Superficial Digital Flexor###
- Lies between flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris.  
- Flexes the carpus and proximal interphalangeal joints of digits II–V.  

###9. Deep Digital Flexor###
- Three-headed muscle inserting on distal phalanges.  
- Flexes carpus and all digital joints; crucial for claw retraction.  

###10. Interossei Muscles###
- Located between metacarpal bones.  
- Stabilize metacarpophalangeal joints and aid in digit flexion.  

###11. Lumbricales###
- Small muscles near the deep digital flexor tendons.  
- Flex metacarpophalangeal joints and extend distal interphalangeal joints.  

###12. Palmaris Brevis###
- Thin superficial muscle on the medial paw.  
- Tenses palmar skin and aids grip.  

##Function##
- **Extension of digits and carpus:** by dorsal extensor group.  
- **Flexion of digits and carpus:** by palmar flexor group.  
- **Claw control:** deep digital flexor retracts claws; extensors extend them.  
- **Grip and precision:** interossei and lumbricales refine digital movement.  
- **Support:** stabilize the paw during stance, climbing, and grasping.

#Brachium Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **shoulder joint and the elbow**, forming the upper portion of the forelimb.  
These muscles control **flexion and extension** of the elbow, as well as **rotation and stabilization** of the limb during movement and weight-bearing.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, spindle-shaped muscles** grouped around the humerus.  
Includes both **flexor** and **extensor** groups, arranged in cranial and caudal compartments, allowing smooth and precise forelimb motion.

##Parts##

###1. Biceps Brachii###
- Located on the cranial surface of the brachium.  
- Origin: supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula.  
- Insertion: radial tuberosity and ulna.  
- **Function:** Flexes the elbow and extends the shoulder; stabilizes the joint during locomotion.  

###2. Brachialis###
- Lies lateral to the biceps brachii, wrapping around the humerus.  
- Origin: proximal humerus.  
- Insertion: ulna near the elbow.  
- **Function:** Flexes the elbow joint.  

###3. Triceps Brachii###
- Largest muscle of the brachium; forms the caudal contour of the upper limb.  
- Origin: scapula (long head) and humerus (lateral, medial, and accessory heads).  
- Insertion: olecranon of the ulna.  
- **Function:** Extends the elbow and flexes the shoulder (long head).  

###4. Tensor Fasciae Antebrachii###
- Lies along the caudal surface of the triceps.  
- Origin: latissimus dorsi and fascia of the trunk.  
- Insertion: olecranon.  
- **Function:** Extends the elbow and tenses the antebrachial fascia.  

###5. Anconeus###
- Small triangular muscle at the elbow joint.  
- Origin: distal humerus.  
- Insertion: olecranon.  
- **Function:** Extends the elbow and stabilizes the joint capsule.  

##Function##
- **Flexion of the elbow:** by biceps brachii and brachialis.  
- **Extension of the elbow:** by triceps brachii, tensor fasciae antebrachii, and anconeus.  
- **Shoulder stabilization:** by biceps brachii and triceps long head.  
- Provides precise control and strength for grooming, climbing, and landing.

#Throat Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **ventral cervical region**, between the **mandible and thoracic inlet**, surrounding the **pharynx, larynx, and trachea**.  
These muscles form the **walls of the pharyngeal and laryngeal cavities**, controlling swallowing, vocalization, and airway function.  

##Shape##
Composed of **thin, strap-like and layered muscles** arranged around the upper airway and digestive entrance.  
They include both **extrinsic muscles** (connecting throat to external structures) and **intrinsic muscles** (within the pharynx and larynx).  

##Parts##

###1. Sternohyoideus###
- Extends from the sternum to the basihyoid bone.  
- **Function:** Pulls the tongue and larynx caudally during swallowing.  

###2. Sternothyroideus###
- Runs parallel and lateral to the sternohyoideus.  
- **Function:** Draws the larynx caudally and stabilizes the trachea.  

###3. Thyrohyoideus###
- Short muscle between the thyroid cartilage and basihyoid bone.  
- **Function:** Shortens the distance between larynx and hyoid, aiding in swallowing.  

###4. Mylohyoideus###
- Thin sheet forming the floor of the mouth between mandibles.  
- **Function:** Raises the floor of the mouth and tongue during swallowing.  

###5. Geniohyoideus###
- Lies deep to the mylohyoideus, extending from mandible to hyoid.  
- **Function:** Draws the hyoid and larynx rostrally, aiding deglutition.  

###6. Omohyoideus###
- Slender muscle extending from the shoulder fascia to the hyoid.  
- **Function:** Retracts the hyoid apparatus and stabilizes the throat.  

###7. Cricothyroideus###
- On the ventral surface of the larynx.  
- **Function:** Tenses the vocal folds, modulating pitch and sound.  

###8. Cricoarytenoideus Dorsalis###
- Dorsal laryngeal muscle.  
- **Function:** Abducts vocal folds, opening the glottis for breathing.  

###9. Cricoarytenoideus Lateralis###
- Lateral surface of larynx.  
- **Function:** Adducts vocal folds, closing the glottis during swallowing or phonation.  

###10. Thyroarytenoideus###
- Forms part of the vocal folds.  
- **Function:** Relaxes and fine-tunes vocal cord tension.  

##Function##
- **Swallowing:** Coordinated movement of sternohyoideus, sternothyroideus, geniohyoideus, and mylohyoideus.  
- **Breathing:** Cricoarytenoideus muscles regulate glottal opening.  
- **Vocalization:** Intrinsic laryngeal muscles adjust vocal cord tension and vibration.  
- **Protection:** Closes airway during swallowing to prevent aspiration.  
- **Support:** Stabilizes larynx, hyoid, and trachea during head and neck movement.

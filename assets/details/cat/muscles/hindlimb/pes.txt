#Pes Muscles#

The cat’s pes muscles, located in the distal hindlimb, control the tarsus, digits, and paw.  
They enable precise balance, grip, and smooth coordination in motion.  
Energetically, they represent **grounding, agility, and connection to Earth**.

###Parts###

##Digital Flexors##  
Flex the digits and support gripping and landing.  
Energetically, symbolize **connection and adaptability**.

##Digital Extensors##  
Lift the digits for forward stride and balance.  
Energetically, reflect **readiness and awareness**.

##Tendons and Ligaments##  
Stabilize joints and prevent overextension.  
Energetically, embody **resilience and structural trust**.

##Interosseous Fibers##  
Provide fine control and tactile feedback.  
Energetically, represent **sensitivity and harmonious movement**.

###Function###  
The pes muscles maintain limb stability, absorb impact, and coordinate paw precision during movement.  
Energetically, they root the cat’s agility, balancing **strength with sensitivity**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: from jumping or sharp turns.  
Tenderness: irritation or inflammation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **instability, fear of grounding, or scattered energy**.

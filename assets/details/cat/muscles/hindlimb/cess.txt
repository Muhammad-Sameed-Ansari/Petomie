#Cess (Gluteal Muscles)#

##Location##
Located around the **pelvis and upper hindquarters**, forming the muscular croup and outer surface of the hip region.  
These muscles connect the pelvis to the femur and provide propulsion for the hindlimbs.

##Shape##
Broad, thick, and layered muscles arranged to produce strong extension and abduction of the hip joint.  
They cover both superficial and deep layers of the hip region.

##Parts##

###1. Superficial Gluteal###
- Lies over the hip joint.  
- Extends and abducts the thigh.  

###2. Middle Gluteal###
- Largest of the gluteal group, covering the lateral surface of the hip.  
- Extends and stabilizes the hip, moving the limb backward during propulsion.  

###3. Deep Gluteal###
- Lies beneath the middle gluteal.  
- Rotates the limb medially and helps maintain hip stability.  

###4. Tensor Fasciae Latae###
- Located at the front of the thigh, connected to the fascia lata.  
- Flexes the hip and tightens the fascia to support the limb.  

##Function##
Extend, abduct, and stabilize the hip joint.  
Provide forward thrust during running and jumping while supporting pelvic balance.

#Crus Muscles#

The cat’s crus muscles form the lower hindlimb region between the stifle and hock.  
They control flexion and extension of the hock, supporting stability during landing and push-off.  
Energetically, they represent **adaptability, grounded flow, and flexible strength**.

###Parts###

##Gastrocnemius##  
The large calf muscle that extends the hock and aids propulsion.  
Energetically, symbolizes **forward momentum and drive**.

##Soleus##  
Assists in extending the hock and maintaining posture.  
Energetically, reflects **stability and endurance**.

##Flexor and Extensor Groups##  
Control precise movement of the hock and digits.  
Energetically, represent **balance between action and rest**.

##Tibialis Cranialis##  
Flexes the hock and stabilizes the limb during motion.  
Energetically, embodies **clarity, direction, and lightness**.

###Function###  
The crus muscles provide coordinated power and control during running, jumping, and landing.  
Energetically, they maintain **rhythm and fluidity between motion and grounding**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: overuse or strain.  
Weakness: fatigue or instability in gait.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of flow or inner resistance**.

#Medial Thigh Muscles#

The cat’s medial thigh muscles lie along the **inner surface of the hindlimb**, linking the pelvis to the femur and tibia.  
They draw the limb inward, stabilize the pelvis, and assist in both flexion and extension of the hip and stifle joints.  
Their coordinated movement allows the cat to maintain posture, balance, and controlled motion during walking, running, or jumping.  
Energetically, they represent **unity, grounding, and balance between inner and outer strength**.

###Parts###

##Adductor Longus##  
A **thin, elongated muscle** that runs from the **pubic bone** to the **midshaft of the femur**.  
It assists in adducting the limb and stabilizing the hip during stance.  
Energetically, it represents **focused control and inner centering** — the ability to draw energy inward and maintain balance.

##Adductor Brevis##  
A **short, deep muscle** located between the adductor longus and magnus.  
It connects the **pubic ramus** to the **proximal femur**, supporting subtle inward motion and pelvic alignment.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **integration and harmony**, blending flexibility with grounded strength.

##Adductor Magnus##  
A **broad, powerful muscle** forming the deepest layer of the adductors.  
Originates from the **ischial tuberosity** and inserts along the **medial femur**, producing strong adduction and extension of the hip.  
Energetically, it reflects **stability, endurance, and support**, embodying the power of grounded action.

##Gracilis##  
A **flat, sheet-like muscle** covering most of the inner thigh.  
It originates at the **pelvic symphysis** and inserts on the **tibia and crural fascia**.  
Functions to **adduct the hip**, **flex the stifle**, and **extend the tarsus**, coordinating multi-joint motion during stride and jump.  
Energetically, it represents **grace, unity, and fluid adaptability**, allowing balanced flow through all stages of movement.

##Sartorius##  
A **long, strap-like muscle** running diagonally across the thigh.  
It has two portions:  
- **Cranial portion:** flexes the hip and extends the stifle.  
- **Caudal portion:** flexes both hip and stifle.  
Originates from the **iliac crest** and inserts on the **medial tibia**.  
This dual function supports precise adjustments during quick turns, balance recovery, and climbing.  
Energetically, the sartorius embodies **agility, coordination, and conscious adaptability**, blending precision with motion.

###Function###  
The medial thigh muscles collectively:  
- Adduct the hindlimb and stabilize the pelvis.  
- Control hip and stifle motion during movement.  
- Support coordinated flexion, extension, and balance in posture.  
Energetically, they link **grounded stability with smooth flow**, guiding movement through unity and controlled strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
**Tightness:** inward pulling of the limb, pelvic stiffness, or reduced stride.  
**Weakness:** instability, lateral sway, or uneven gait.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **resistance to movement, overcontrol, or disconnection from inner grounding**.

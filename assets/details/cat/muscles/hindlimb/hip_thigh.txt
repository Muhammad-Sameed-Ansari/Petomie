#Hip and Thigh Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **pelvis and stifle (knee)**, surrounding the femur.  
These muscles provide the main strength for locomotion and limb control.

##Shape##
Long, spindle-shaped muscles forming the bulk of the upper hindlimb.  
Arranged into cranial, caudal, and medial groups for coordinated hip and knee movement.

##Parts##

###1. Biceps Femoris###
- Large lateral muscle extending from pelvis to tibia.  
- Extends hip and stifle, flexes hock.  

###2. Semitendinosus###
- Runs along the caudal thigh.  
- Extends hip and hock, flexes stifle.  

###3. Semimembranosus###
- Lies medial to semitendinosus.  
- Extends hip and adducts limb.  

###4. Quadriceps Femoris###
- Group of four muscles on the cranial thigh.  
- Extends stifle and flexes hip.  

###5. Sartorius###
- Thin, strap-like muscle along the medial thigh.  
- Flexes hip and stifle.  

###6. Gracilis###
- Broad, flat muscle covering the inner thigh.  
- Adducts limb, extends hip and hock.  

###7. Pectineus###
- Small muscle on medial thigh.  
- Adducts and stabilizes femur.  

###8. Adductor###
- Deep medial muscle connecting pelvis to femur.  
- Draws limb inward and stabilizes stance.  

##Function##
Control flexion and extension of hip, stifle, and hock joints.  
Provide strength and stability during walking, running, and jumping.  
Maintain balance and limb alignment in motion.

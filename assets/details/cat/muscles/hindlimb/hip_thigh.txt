#Hip and Thigh Muscles#

The cat’s hip and thigh muscles form the main power center of the hindlimbs, enabling jumping, running, and balance.  
They connect the pelvis to the femur and control the hindlimb’s propulsion and stability.  
Energetically, they represent **strength, motion, and confidence in forward movement**.

###Parts###

##Gluteal Muscles##  
Provide thrust and stabilize the hip joint.  
Energetically, symbolize **power, independence, and freedom**.

##Hamstring Group (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus)##  
Extend the hip and flex the stifle.  
Energetically, represent **momentum, grounding, and action**.

##Quadriceps Femoris##  
Extends the stifle for jumping and running.  
Energetically, reflects **drive, determination, and progress**.

##Adductor Group##  
Draws the limb inward and stabilizes stance.  
Energetically, embodies **balance and integration**.

###Function###  
These muscles generate propulsion, stabilize the pelvis, and coordinate smooth movement of the hindquarters.  
Energetically, they align **physical power with emotional confidence**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted movement or stiffness.  
Weakness: loss of thrust or coordination.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **fear of moving forward or suppressed energy**.

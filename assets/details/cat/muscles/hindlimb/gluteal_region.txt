#Gluteal Region Muscles#

The cat’s gluteal region muscles form the powerful group that extends, abducts, and stabilizes the hip.  
They connect the pelvis to the femur, generating propulsion and balance in jumping and climbing.  
Energetically, they represent **power, independence, and confident movement**.

###Parts###

##Superficial Gluteal##  
Extends and abducts the hip.  
Energetically, symbolizes **freedom and self-expression**.

##Middle Gluteal##  
Provides strength and propulsion during stride.  
Energetically, reflects **courage and forward motion**.

##Deep Gluteal##  
Rotates and stabilizes the hip joint.  
Energetically, represents **inner balance and grounded direction**.

###Function###  
The gluteal muscles extend, rotate, and stabilize the hip during motion.  
Energetically, they express **empowerment, balance, and dynamic confidence**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: stiffness or reduced flexibility.  
Weakness: poor propulsion or hip instability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **insecurity or blocked movement forward**.

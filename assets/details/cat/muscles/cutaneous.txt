#Cutaneous Muscle#

##Location##
Located within the **superficial fascia** just beneath the skin, covering the **neck, trunk, and limbs**.  
Most developed over the **lateral thorax and abdomen**, extending toward the **shoulder and thigh**.  
In the cat, this muscle forms a continuous thin sheet that allows precise skin twitching across the body.

##Shape##
A **thin, sheet-like muscular layer** composed of fine fibers interwoven with connective tissue.  
It is loosely attached to the underlying fascia, allowing free skin movement.  
Well-developed in the **cutaneous trunci region**, less distinct over the dorsal midline and limbs.

##Parts##

###1. Cutaneous Trunci###
- The main portion of the cutaneous muscle.  
- Covers the sides of the thorax and abdomen, extending from shoulder to thigh.  
- Attaches to the fascia over the triceps and latissimus dorsi.  

###2. Cutaneous Colli###
- Found along the lower neck.  
- Extends from the sternum upward and backward beneath the skin.  
- Thin and narrow but assists with neck skin motion.  

###3. Cutaneous Omobrachialis###
- Small section near the shoulder.  
- Connects to the skin over the shoulder and upper limb.  

###4. Facial Cutaneous Areas###
- Includes small superficial muscle slips associated with facial skin movement.  
- Found around the lips, eyes, and ears; continuous with facial muscles.  

##Function##
- Enables **skin twitching (panniculus reflex)** to remove irritants like insects.  
- Provides **protective movement** of the skin during grooming or stretching.  
- Allows **fine adjustments** for coat direction and flexibility.  
- Contributes to **skin mobility** and surface protection during locomotion.

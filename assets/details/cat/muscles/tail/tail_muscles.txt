#Tail Muscles – Main Movers#

##Location##
Extend from the **pelvis and sacrum** along the **caudal vertebrae** to the tail tip.  
These muscles form the **main mass of the tail**, found dorsally, ventrally, and laterally.

###Shape###
Composed of **elongated muscle bands** running the length of the tail.  
They are grouped as **elevators, depressors, and lateral flexors**, controlling tail height, curl, and wagging.

##Parts##

###1. Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Medialis###
- Central dorsal muscle along the top of the tail.  
- **Function:** Elevates the tail and holds it upright.  

###2. Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Lateralis###
- On the sides of the dorsal tail.  
- **Function:** Lifts and moves the tail sideways; aids in turning.  

###3. Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Medialis###
- Beneath the tail along the midline.  
- **Function:** Depresses and lowers the tail.  

###4. Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Lateralis###
- Lateral to the ventral midline.  
- **Function:** Assists in downward and inward tail movements.  

###5. Intertransversarii Caudae###
- Small muscles between vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Stabilize and guide tail bending.  

###6. Coccygeus###
- From the pelvic wall to the first few caudal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Controls tail base and assists in lateral tail flexion.  

##Function##
Provides **main tail movements** such as lifting, lowering, and wagging.  
Maintains **balance and communication** through flexible and controlled motion.  
Stabilizes the tail base and protects the pelvic outlet during movement.

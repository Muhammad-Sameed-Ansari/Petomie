#Tail Muscles – Surface Layer#

##Location##
Situated just beneath the **skin and superficial fascia** at the base and along the surface of the cat’s tail.  
These muscles lie above the deeper tail movers and are closely connected to the **cutaneous trunci** and **fascia of the rump**.

###Shape###
Thin, flexible muscle sheets and narrow bands extending along the tail.  
They provide light control and surface motion for expressive tail gestures.

##Parts##

###1. Caudal Extension of Cutaneous Trunci###
- Superficial sheet near the base of the tail.  
- **Function:** Moves the skin and helps with small tail adjustments.  

###2. Superficial Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Lateralis###
- Runs along the upper sides of the tail.  
- **Function:** Elevates and slightly lifts the tail laterally.  

###3. Superficial Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Lateralis###
- Lies on the lower side of the tail.  
- **Function:** Depresses the tail gently for subtle downward movements.  

###4. Intertransversarii Caudae (Superficial)###
- Short muscles connecting nearby vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Support side-to-side movement and stabilize the surface layer.  

##Function##
Allows **fine, visible tail movements** for balance, communication, and expression.  
Assists deeper muscles by **refining elevation, depression, and lateral wagging**.  
Helps maintain smooth, flexible tail motion with minimal effort.

#Tail Muscles – Deep Layer#

##Location##
Lies closest to the **caudal vertebrae**, beneath the main tail muscle groups.  
Most concentrated near the **base of the tail**, controlling small, precise adjustments.

###Shape###
Consists of **short, compact muscles** connecting adjacent vertebrae.  
These deep fibers control fine motion and vertebral alignment.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidi Caudae###
- Tiny overlapping muscles along the dorsal spine of the tail.  
- **Function:** Stabilize and finely extend tail segments.  

###2. Interspinales Caudae###
- Between dorsal spines of neighboring vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Help extend and stabilize the tail midline.  

###3. Intertransversarii Caudae Profundi###
- Deep muscles between transverse processes.  
- **Function:** Allow micro-adjustments and resist unwanted lateral tail bending.  

##Function##
Ensure **stability of each tail vertebra** for smooth, controlled motion.  
Allow **fine-tuned tail coordination** used in balance, hunting, and communication.  
Provide **postural control** during movement, jumping, and landing.

#Tail Deep Muscles#

The cat’s deep tail muscles form the innermost layer, connecting the tail vertebrae to the pelvis and sacrum.  
They stabilize and control the tail’s base movement.  
Energetically, they represent **inner strength, grounding, and stability of emotional flow**.

###Parts###

##Intertransversarii Caudae##  
Stabilize vertebrae and fine-tune movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **precision and centeredness**.

##Sacrococcygeus Dorsalis and Ventralis##  
Flex and extend the tail base.  
Energetically, reflect **balance between strength and fluidity**.

##Coccygeus##  
Connects sacrum to tail, aiding flexion and stabilization.  
Energetically, represents **root strength and emotional grounding**.

###Function###  
The deep muscles support balance, communication, and controlled tail motion.  
Energetically, they ground energy through the spine, linking body and emotion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted movement or lower back stiffness.  
Weakness: imbalance in coordination.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of grounding or energetic disconnection**.

#Gustatory (Taste) System#

##Location##
The gustatory system is located on the **tongue**, **soft palate**, and **throat**. 
Taste buds are concentrated mostly on the tip and sides of the tongue. 
Taste information is transmitted to the brain via the **facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves**.

###Shape###
The **tongue** is muscular and covered with **papillae**, tiny structures that provide texture and contain taste buds.  
Cats also have sharp, backward-facing papillae that help clean fur and grasp food.  

##Function##
- Taste buds detect **salty, sour, bitter, and umami** flavors, but not sweet, as cats lack the gene for sweet taste receptors.  
- Chemicals from food dissolve in saliva and stimulate taste receptor cells.  
- These signals travel through cranial nerves to the brain to recognize flavor and safety.  
- Taste works closely with **smell** to guide eating behavior and food preference.  

Cats rely more on **smell and texture** than taste when choosing food.

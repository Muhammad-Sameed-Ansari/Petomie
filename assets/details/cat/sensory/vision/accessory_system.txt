#Accessory Structures#

The cat’s accessory structures include the whiskers, claws, and glands that enhance sensory perception, grooming, and protection.  
These structures contribute to balance, communication, and environmental awareness.  
Energetically, they represent **intuition, defense, and adaptability** — the tools of sensitivity and self-expression.

###Parts###

##Whiskers (Vibrissae)##  
Long tactile hairs that detect vibrations and movement in the air.  
Energetically, they symbolize **perception, awareness, and boundaries**.

##Claws##  
Retractable keratin structures used for climbing, defense, and grooming.  
Energetically, they represent **strength, grounding, and protection of personal space**.

##Sebaceous Glands##  
Produce oils that keep the skin and fur conditioned.  
Energetically, they reflect **flow, self-care, and emotional lubrication**.

##Sweat Glands##  
Present mainly in paw pads to aid cooling and scent marking.  
Energetically, symbolize **release and purification**.

##Scent Glands##  
Located around the face, paws, and tail base, used for communication and marking territory.  
Energetically, they embody **identity, connection, and energetic imprint**.

###Function###  
Accessory structures support sensory awareness, self-maintenance, and communication.  
They enable the cat to interact gracefully and instinctively with its surroundings.  
Energetically, they align the physical and subtle bodies, enhancing **intuition and self-expression**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Broken whiskers: sensory confusion or emotional overload.  
Claw issues: tension, aggression, or imbalance in personal boundaries.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **defensiveness or blocked intuition**.

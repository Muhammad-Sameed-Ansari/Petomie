#Accessory System#

##Location##
Surrounding the eyes are several protective and supportive structures — the eyelids, third eyelid, lacrimal glands, conjunctiva, and muscles that move the eyes. 
These are located within and around the bony orbit of the skull.

###Shape###
- Eyelids: Thin folds of skin that open and close vertically.  
- Eyelashes: Short protective hairs along the upper eyelid.  
- Third Eyelid (Nictitating Membrane): A thin, pale membrane in the inner corner of the eye.  
- Lacrimal Glands: Small tear-producing glands near the upper eyelid.  
- Conjunctiva: Thin mucous membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white of the eye.  
- Extraocular Muscles: Six small muscles controlling movement and focus.

##Function##
- Eyelids and Eyelashes: Shield the eyes from dirt and bright light.  
- Third Eyelid: Cleans and protects the eye surface.  
- Lacrimal Glands: Produce tears for moisture and cleaning.  
- Conjunctiva: Protects against infection and keeps the eye moist.  
- Extraocular Muscles: Move the eye smoothly for clear and accurate vision.

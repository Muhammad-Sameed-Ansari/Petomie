#Visual System#

##Location##
The eyes are located toward the front of the cat’s head, giving them excellent depth perception and strong binocular vision. 
They are slightly angled outward, allowing wide peripheral vision and precise focus during hunting or jumping. 
Each eye connects to the brain’s visual cortex through the optic nerve.

###Shape###
Rounded, luminous eyes with a large pupil, transparent cornea, and reflective inner layer. 
The outer shell (cornea and sclera) protects and maintains eye structure. 
The inner layers (iris, lens, retina, and choroid) focus light and create images.

##Function##
- The cornea and lens bend light to form an image on the retina.  
- The iris adjusts the pupil, controlling light entry.  
- The retina transforms light into electrical signals using rods and cones.  
  - Rods detect motion and dim light (for night vision).  
  - Cones detect limited colors (mostly blue and green).  
- The tapetum lucidum, a reflective membrane behind the retina, enhances low-light vision.  
- The optic nerve carries signals to the brain for interpretation.  
- Ciliary muscles change lens shape to focus on near or far objects.  

Cats see very well in the dark but perceive fewer colors than humans.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Third Eye Chakra – intuition, awareness, and higher perception.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Liver and Gallbladder Meridians – clarity and direction.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The eyes symbolize insight, trust, and awareness. Imbalance may appear as fear, over-alertness, or avoidance.

#System Structures#

The cat’s visual system structures detect light, process visual input, and transmit signals to the brain.
They are highly specialized for low-light vision, motion detection, and precision.
Energetically, they represent perception, intuition, interpretation, and focused awareness.

###Parts###

##Retina##
The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye containing photoreceptors.
Converts light into neural signals.
Energetically, represents perception and awareness.

##Rods##
Photoreceptors specialized for low-light and motion detection.
Highly developed in cats.
Energetically, symbolize intuition, sensitivity, and awareness in darkness.

##Cones##
Photoreceptors responsible for color and fine detail.
Cats primarily perceive blue and green hues.
Energetically, represent discernment and clarity.

##Optic Disc##
The point where the optic nerve exits the retina.
Energetically, symbolizes transition and integration of perception.

##Optic Nerve##
Carries visual information from the eye to the brain.
Energetically, represents communication and trust.

##Optic Chiasm##
Crossing of optic nerve fibers allowing coordination between both eyes.
Energetically, reflects balance and integration.

##Optic Tract##
Transmits visual signals toward the brain.
Energetically, symbolizes direction and continuity.

##Lateral Geniculate Nucleus##
Processes visual signals in the thalamus before reaching the cortex.
Energetically, represents filtering and interpretation.

##Visual Cortex##
Located in the occipital lobe of the brain.
Interprets visual information into meaningful images.
Energetically, symbolizes understanding, awareness, and insight.

###Function###
Receive light, convert it into neural signals, process motion and detail, and interpret the environment accurately.
Energetically, these structures support intuition, orientation, precision, and confident navigation.

###Common Imbalances###
Vision impairment, night vision issues, neurological visual disturbances.
Energetically, imbalance may reflect confusion, fear, or difficulty interpreting visual input.

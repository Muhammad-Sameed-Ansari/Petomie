#System Structures#

The cat’s integumentary system includes the skin, fur, and underlying connective tissues forming the body’s outer protection.  
It maintains internal balance, supports thermoregulation, and provides sensory feedback.  
Energetically, it represents **protection, identity, and expression** — the sacred boundary between inner and outer worlds.

###Parts###

##Skin##  
Composed of epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous layers.  
Provides protection, sensation, and temperature regulation.  
Energetically, symbolizes **boundaries, resilience, and emotional defense**.

##Fur##  
Soft and dense covering that regulates temperature and enhances tactile sensitivity.  
Energetically, represents **comfort, intuition, and energetic insulation**.

##Connective Tissue##  
Binds skin to underlying muscles and organs.  
Energetically, reflects **unity, strength, and flexibility**.

##Blood Vessels and Nerves##  
Supply nourishment and sensory information.  
Energetically, they embody **communication and life flow**.

###Function###  
The system structures maintain physical protection, regulate body temperature, and support sensory awareness.  
They act as the interface between the cat and its environment.  
Energetically, they balance **vulnerability and strength**, allowing authentic interaction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dry or irritated skin: dehydration or emotional sensitivity.  
Shedding issues: stress or energetic release cycles.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **lack of boundaries or overexposure**.

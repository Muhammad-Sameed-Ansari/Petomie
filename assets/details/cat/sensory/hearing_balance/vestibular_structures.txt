#Vestibular Structures#

##Location##
The vestibular system is located deep within the inner ear, inside the temporal bone of the skull. 
It lies next to the cochlea (hearing organ) and connects to the brainstem and cerebellum through the vestibular nerve. 
It also interacts with the eyes, spine, and limb muscles to maintain balance, posture, and orientation.

###Shape###
The vestibular system is composed of fluid-filled chambers and canals that detect movement and position changes:  
- Semicircular Canals: Three curved, loop-like structures arranged at right angles, sensing rotation and turning of the head.  
- Vestibule: A central cavity containing two sacs:  
  - Utricle: Detects horizontal movement (side to side, forward, backward).  
  - Saccule: Detects vertical movement (up and down).  
- Hair Cells (Mechanoreceptors): Tiny sensory cells that detect movement of fluid inside the canals and send signals to the brain.  
- Vestibular Nerve: Carries these balance messages from the inner ear to the brain.

##Function##
- Detects head position, movement, and acceleration in all directions.  
- Helps the brain coordinate eye and body movements to maintain focus and balance.  
- Allows the cat to make rapid adjustments while walking, climbing, or jumping.  
- Works closely with visual and proprioceptive systems to create perfect coordination and orientation in space.  
- Enables cats to perform their famous “righting reflex” — the ability to twist midair and land on their feet.  

A healthy vestibular system gives cats exceptional balance, smooth motion, and confidence in movement.

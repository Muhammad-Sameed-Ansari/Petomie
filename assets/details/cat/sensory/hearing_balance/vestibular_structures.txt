#Vestibular Structures#

The cat’s vestibular system governs balance, spatial orientation, and coordination.  
It enables graceful movement and precise control of posture and motion.  
Energetically, it represents **equilibrium, centeredness, and harmony between mind and body**.

###Parts###

##Semicircular Canals##  
Three fluid-filled loops that detect rotation and movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **flow, rhythm, and adaptability**.

##Utricle and Saccule##  
Detect linear acceleration and body position relative to gravity.  
Energetically, represent **stability, grounding, and spatial awareness**.

##Vestibular Nerve##  
Transmits balance information to the brain.  
Energetically, reflects **communication between stability and perception**.

##Cerebellum and Brainstem Connections##  
Integrate balance signals for coordination and posture control.  
Energetically, embody **integration, harmony, and graceful alignment**.

###Function###  
The vestibular structures maintain equilibrium and smooth movement.  
They synchronize sensory input from eyes, muscles, and joints to guide balance.  
Energetically, they sustain **inner harmony and trust in one’s movement through life**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Loss of balance: vestibular disease or infection.  
Disorientation: neurological or energetic disturbance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **inner conflict or loss of grounding**.

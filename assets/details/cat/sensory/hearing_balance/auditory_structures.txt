#Auditory Structures#

The cat’s auditory system is extremely refined, allowing detection of a wide range of frequencies and subtle sound cues.  
It helps locate prey, communicate, and interpret energetic vibrations in the environment.  
Energetically, it represents **awareness, perception, and intuitive listening** — hearing beyond sound into energy and emotion.

###Parts###

##External Ear (Pinna)##  
Large, mobile structures that capture and funnel sound waves toward the ear canal.  
Energetically, symbolize **receptivity, direction, and focus**.

##Ear Canal##  
A narrow tube that channels sound to the eardrum and amplifies specific frequencies.  
Energetically, represents **clarity and refined attention**.

##Tympanic Membrane (Eardrum)##  
Vibrates with sound waves, transferring energy to the middle ear bones.  
Energetically, reflects **resonance and responsiveness**.

##Ossicles (Malleus, Incus, Stapes)##  
Tiny bones that transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear.  
Energetically, symbolize **transformation and precise communication**.

##Cochlea##  
A spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear that converts sound vibrations into nerve impulses.  
Energetically, represents **harmonic understanding and inner alignment**.

###Function###  
The auditory structures detect and interpret sounds with great precision, aiding hunting, balance, and communication.  
Energetically, they support **deep listening and attunement to emotional and energetic frequencies**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Hearing loss: infection, wax buildup, or age.  
Oversensitivity: stress or noise overload.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **difficulty listening inwardly or external chaos**.

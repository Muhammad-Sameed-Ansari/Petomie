#Cutaneous Hearing#

The cat’s cutaneous hearing involves vibration and sound perception through the skin and hair follicles.  
This subtle sensory layer allows detection of low-frequency sounds, environmental movement, and energy vibrations.  
Energetically, it represents **intuitive sensing, energetic awareness, and environmental harmony**.

###Parts###

##Skin Receptors##  
Detect pressure, vibration, and movement on the skin surface.  
Energetically, symbolize **awareness, sensitivity, and subtle communication**.

##Hair Follicles##  
Transmit fine vibrations to the nervous system.  
Energetically, represent **connection to the environment and energy flow**.

##Subcutaneous Nerves##  
Carry signals from skin receptors to the brain.  
Energetically, reflect **communication between physical and energetic perception**.

##Vibrissae (Whiskers)##  
Serve as an extension of tactile and auditory awareness, detecting vibrations in the air.  
Energetically, symbolize **intuition, balance, and energetic boundaries**.

###Function###  
Cutaneous hearing enhances environmental awareness and emotional perception.  
It allows the cat to sense energy shifts, distant movement, and vibration patterns beyond human perception.  
Energetically, it bridges the **physical and subtle hearing systems**, deepening sensitivity and intuition.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overstimulation: hypersensitivity or anxiety.  
Understimulation: numbness or energetic disconnection.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **emotional overload or blocked awareness**.

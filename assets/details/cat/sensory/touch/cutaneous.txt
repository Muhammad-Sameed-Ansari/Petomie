#Cutaneous Hearing Structures#

##Location##
The outer and middle ear are on the sides of the head and include the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum.  

###Shape###
- Pinna: Triangular, highly mobile ear flap.  
- Ear Canal: Deep, slightly curved tube.  
- Eardrum: Vibrates in response to sound waves.  
- Ossicles: Tiny bones transferring vibrations to the inner ear.

##Function##
- Captures and directs sound waves toward the eardrum.  
- Vibrations are transmitted to the ossicles.

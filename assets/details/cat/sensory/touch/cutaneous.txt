#Cutaneous Touch#

The cat’s cutaneous touch system involves sensation through the skin, fur, whiskers, and surface nerve endings.  
It allows the cat to feel pressure, temperature, pain, and subtle environmental contact.  
Energetically, it represents **safety, boundaries, emotional connection, and environmental awareness**.

###Parts###

##Skin Receptors##  
Detect pressure, temperature, pain, and light touch.  
Energetically, symbolize **sensitivity, safety, and perception of the outside world**.

##Hair Follicles##  
Sense movement and air flow through the fur.  
Energetically, represent **alertness and environmental awareness**.

##Vibrissae (Whiskers)##  
Highly sensitive tactile hairs that detect objects, air currents, and spatial proximity.  
Energetically, symbolize **intuition, navigation, and energetic boundaries**.

##Paw Pads##  
Contain pressure and vibration receptors used for movement and grip.  
Energetically, represent **grounding and connection to the Earth**.

##Cutaneous Nerves##  
Transmit touch signals from the skin to the brain.  
Energetically, reflect **communication between the physical body and emotional awareness**.

#Proprioceptive Touch#

The cat’s proprioceptive touch system allows it to sense the position, movement, and tension of its own body.  
This internal touch perception creates balance, coordination, and graceful movement.  
Energetically, it represents **self-awareness, embodiment, and inner stability**.

###Parts###

##Muscle Spindles##  
Detect muscle stretch and movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **flexibility, adaptability, and awareness of motion**.

##Tendon Organs##  
Sense tension and force within tendons.  
Energetically, represent **strength, boundaries, and controlled power**.

##Joint Receptors##  
Detect joint position and angle.  
Energetically, symbolize **direction, alignment, and purposeful movement**.

##Fascia##  
Connects muscles, bones, and organs, transmitting tension and motion.  
Energetically, represents **flow, integration, and energetic continuity**.

##Proprioceptive Nerves##  
Carry position and movement signals to the brain.  
Energetically, reflect **inner communication and body awareness**.

###Function###  
Proprioceptive touch allows the cat to walk, jump, climb, and land with precision.  
It supports balance, coordination, and graceful movement.  
Energetically, it creates **confidence, grounding, and trust in the body**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivation: tension, rigidity, restlessness.  
Underactivation: clumsiness, disorientation, insecurity.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **shock, trauma, or loss of inner stability**.

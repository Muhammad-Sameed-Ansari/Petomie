#Olfactory (Smell) System#

##Location##
The olfactory system is found within the **nasal cavity**, extending to the **olfactory bulb** at the front of the brain. 
Cats also possess a **vomeronasal organ (Jacobson’s organ)** located on the roof of the mouth, which detects pheromones and emotional scents.

###Shape###
- **Nostrils (Nares):** Small openings that lead to the nasal cavity.  
- **Nasal Cavity:** Contains thin bony scrolls called **turbinates**, lined with olfactory receptor cells.  
- **Olfactory Bulb:** Brain structure that processes scent information.  
- **Vomeronasal Organ:** Small paired organ in the mouth used for pheromone detection.  

##Function##
- Airborne scent molecules enter the nose and bind to **olfactory receptors**.  
- Signals travel to the **olfactory bulb**, then to the brain, where smells are identified.  
- The **vomeronasal organ** detects social and emotional pheromones, guiding behavior and communication.  
- Smell helps cats navigate, hunt, and recognize other animals or humans.  

Cats have an exceptional sense of smell — about **14 times stronger than humans** — and use it to understand emotional states and environments.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Root and Sacral Chakras – intuition, comfort, and trust.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Lung and Large Intestine Meridians – breathing, purity, and release.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents emotional awareness and instinctive perception. Imbalance may cause restlessness or confusion.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm awareness and sensitivity to subtle energy.  
- **Energetic Support:** Clean air, natural scents, and stable energy flow promote sensory and emotional balance.

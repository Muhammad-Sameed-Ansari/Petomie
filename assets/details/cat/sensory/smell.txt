It helps identify territory, sense emotions, and choose food.  
Energetically, it represents **intuition, trust, and sensitivity** — guiding the cat through unseen realms of perception.

###Parts###

##Nostrils##  
Small and mobile, guiding air into the nasal passages with great accuracy.  
Energetically, they symbolize **focus and awareness** of subtle energetic cues.

##Nasal Cavity##  
Warms, filters, and channels air to the olfactory region.  
Energetically, it reflects **clarity and flow** in perception.

##Olfactory Epithelium##  
Highly developed sensory layer detecting even the faintest scents.  
Energetically, it embodies **deep intuitive sensing and discernment**.

##Vomeronasal Organ (Jacobson’s Organ)##  
Located in the roof of the mouth, detects pheromones and emotional signals.  
Energetically, it connects **instinct to emotion**, bridging physical and energetic awareness.

##Olfactory Bulb##  
Processes scent information and connects it to memory and instinct.  
Energetically, it represents **inner knowing and soul memory**.

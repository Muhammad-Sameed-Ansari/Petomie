#Adipose Tissue#

##Location##
Adipose tissue is **fat-storing connective tissue** found **under the skin**, **around internal organs**, **between muscles**, and **in bone marrow**.  
Cats often store fat in the **abdomen, flanks, and chest area**.  
There are two main types: **white** and **brown** adipose tissue.

##Shape##
It appears as **soft, yellowish, elastic tissue** made up of round fat cells called adipocytes.  
These cells store energy as fat and help cushion and protect other tissues.

- **Energy storage:** Saves energy for later use.  
- **Insulation:** Keeps the body warm.

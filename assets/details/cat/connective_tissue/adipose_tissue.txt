#Adipose Tissue#

In cats, adipose tissue is a specialized connective tissue made mostly of fat cells (adipocytes).  
It cushions organs, insulates the body, and serves as a vital energy reserve.  
Energetically, it represents **comfort, security, and emotional nourishment**.

###Parts###

Energetically, it symbolizes safety and self-protection.

##Brown Adipose Tissue##  
Prominent in kittens and located near the neck and spine, it produces heat for temperature regulation.  
Energetically, it reflects **vitality and transformation**.

##Connective Framework##  
A web of fibers and capillaries supports fat cells and regulates metabolism.  
Energetically, it offers **structure and gentle containment**.

###Function###  
Adipose tissue maintains temperature, cushions organs, and provides energy during fasting or stress.  
Energetically, it sustains **inner calm, grounding, and resilience**.

###Common Imbalances###  
- Excess fat: emotional protection or inactivity.  
- Fat loss: stress, depletion, or overexertion.  
- Cold sensitivity: imbalance in energy flow.  
- Energetic blockage: difficulty in self-nurturing.

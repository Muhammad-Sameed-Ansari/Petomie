#Tendons#

##Location##
Tendons are **strong, flexible cords of connective tissue** that connect **muscles to bones** throughout the cat’s body.  
They are especially important in the **legs and paws**, allowing cats to move gracefully, jump, and land softly.  

##Shape##
They look like **smooth, shiny bands or flat sheets**, made mainly of strong collagen fibers.  
Tendons are slightly elastic, giving cats their characteristic flexibility and silent, springy movement.

##Parts##

###1. Flexor Tendons###
- Found on the underside of the legs and paws.  
- **Function:** Bend (flex) the toes and joints, allowing gripping and silent walking.  

###2. Extensor Tendons###
- Run along the top of the legs and paws.  
- **Function:** Straighten (extend) the toes and limbs during walking, running, or jumping.  

###3. Achilles (Calcaneal) Tendon###
- Located at the back of the hind leg, from the calf muscles to the heel bone.  
- **Function:** Extends the hock joint, helping with pushing off, jumping, and climbing.  

###4. Digital Tendons###
- Extend into each toe.  
- **Function:** Control claw movement — flexor tendons pull claws out, while extensors help retract them.  

###5. Patellar Tendon###
- Found in the front of the knee (stifle).  
- **Function:** Connects the quadriceps muscle to the shin bone, helping extend the leg.  

###6. Deep and Superficial Flexor Tendons###
- Found in the limbs; the deep tendons attach to the end bones of the toes, and the superficial tendons attach to middle bones.  
- **Function:** Work together to allow smooth bending and spring-like motion when walking or running.  

###7. Tendons of the Shoulder and Forelimb###
- Include biceps and triceps tendons.  
- **Function:** Move the forelimb, flex or extend the elbow, and stabilize the shoulder joint.  

##Function##
- **Movement:** Transfer force from muscles to bones for walking, climbing, and pouncing.  
- **Flexibility:** Help cats land softly and move quietly.  
- **Support:** Stabilize joints and prevent overextension.  
- **Energy storage:** Act like springs, storing and releasing energy during movement.  
- **Protection:** Reduce strain on muscles and absorb shock during landing.

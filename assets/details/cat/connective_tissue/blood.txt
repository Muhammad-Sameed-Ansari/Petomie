#Blood#

##Location##
Blood flows through the **heart, lungs, and blood vessels** — reaching every organ and cell.  
It delivers oxygen, nutrients, and hormones while collecting carbon dioxide and other waste products.

##Shape##
Blood is a **red fluid tissue** made up of a liquid part (plasma) and solid components (cells).  
Its bright red color comes from **hemoglobin** in red blood cells, which binds oxygen.

##Parts##

###1. Plasma###
- The liquid portion of blood.  
- **Function:** Transports nutrients, hormones, waste, and heat.  

###2. Red Blood Cells###
- Small round cells filled with hemoglobin.  
- **Function:** Carry oxygen from lungs to tissues and return carbon dioxide to the lungs.  

###3. White Blood Cells###
- Part of the immune system.  
- **Function:** Fight off infections and heal inflammation.  

###4. Platelets###
- Tiny cell pieces.  
- **Function:** Help stop bleeding by forming clots when a vessel is injured.  

###5. Capillaries###
- Very small blood vessels linking arteries and veins.  
- **Function:** Allow oxygen and nutrients to reach the body’s cells.  

###6. Arteries###
- Thick blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.  
- **Function:** Supply oxygenated blood to muscles, organs, and skin.  

###7. Veins###
- Carry blood back to the heart after oxygen is used.  
- **Function:** Return deoxygenated blood to be re-oxygenated in the lungs.  

##Function##
- **Transport:** Moves oxygen, food, and hormones to where they’re needed.  
- **Protection:** Contains immune cells that fight infections.  
- **Healing:** Platelets stop bleeding and close wounds.  
- **Balance:** Keeps temperature and hydration stable.  
- **Detox:** Removes carbon dioxide and waste from the body.

#Lymph#

##Location##
Lymph is a **clear, watery fluid** that travels through the **lymphatic system**, a network of vessels, ducts, and nodes throughout the cat’s body.  
It flows parallel to the blood vessels and passes through **lymph nodes** located in areas such as the neck, armpits, groin, and behind the knees.

##Shape##
Lymph is a **transparent or slightly yellow fluid** made of water, proteins, and immune cells called lymphocytes.  
It moves slowly through thin lymph vessels that contain valves to keep it moving toward the heart.

##Parts##

###1. Lymph Fluid###
- Clear liquid collected from tissues.  
- **Function:** Removes waste, excess fluid, and toxins from body tissues.  

###2. Lymph Nodes###
- Small, bean-shaped filters found throughout the body.  
- **Function:** Trap and destroy bacteria, viruses, and damaged cells.  

###3. Lymph Vessels###
- Thin tubes that carry lymph throughout the body.  
- **Function:** Transport lymph fluid from tissues back to the bloodstream.  

###4. Lymphocytes###
- A type of white blood cell.  
- **Function:** Defend against infection and remember pathogens.  

###5. Spleen###
- Found in the upper abdomen.  
- **Function:** Filters blood, removes old cells, and produces lymphocytes.  

###6. Thymus###
- Located in the chest, larger in kittens.  
- **Function:** Helps young cats develop immune cells (T cells).  

###7. Tonsils###
- Found at the back of the throat.  
- **Function:** Trap and destroy germs entering through the mouth or nose.  

##Function##
- **Immunity:** Protects the body from infection.  
- **Fluid balance:** Removes extra fluid from tissues and returns it to the bloodstream.  
- **Filtration:** Cleans lymph before it re-enters circulation.  
- **Waste removal:** Helps eliminate toxins and bacteria.  
- **Transport:** Carries immune cells to fight infections.

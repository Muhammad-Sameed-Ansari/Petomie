#Ligaments#

##Location##
Ligaments are **strong, flexible bands of connective tissue** that connect **bones to other bones** throughout the cat’s body.  
They are especially important in **joints** such as the knee, spine, shoulders, and tail, providing stability and balance.

##Shape##
Ligaments are **dense, fibrous cords or sheets** made mostly of collagen fibers.  
They are slightly elastic, allowing controlled movement without dislocation.

##Parts##

###1. Cruciate Ligaments###
- Found in the knee (stifle).  
- **Function:** Prevent the bones of the knee from sliding too far forward or backward.  

###2. Collateral Ligaments###
- Found on both sides of major joints like the knee, hock, and elbow.  
- **Function:** Prevent side-to-side movement and stabilize joints.  

###3. Patellar Ligament###
- Connects the kneecap (patella) to the tibia.  
- **Function:** Helps extend and stabilize the hind leg.  

###4. Nuchal Ligament###
- Runs along the top of the neck.  
- **Function:** Supports the head and neck.  

###5. Supraspinous Ligament###
- Extends along the back, continuing from the nuchal ligament.  
- **Function:** Supports the spine during movement.  

###6. Intervertebral Ligaments###
- Found between vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Allow flexibility and stability of the spine.  

###7. Sacrotuberous Ligament###
- Connects the pelvis to the femur region.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes the hind limb and helps with weight transfer.  

##Function##
- **Stability:** Keep joints aligned and prevent dislocation.  
- **Support:** Maintain posture and assist in controlled movement.  
- **Flexibility:** Allow safe, limited motion.  
- **Protection:** Prevent injury from overextension or twisting.

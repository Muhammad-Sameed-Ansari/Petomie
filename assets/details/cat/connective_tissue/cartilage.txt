#Cartilage#

In cats, cartilage is a smooth, flexible connective tissue found in joints, ears, nose, and the respiratory tract.  
It cushions movement and shapes soft structures.  
Energetically, it represents **flexibility, adaptability, and harmony in motion**.

###Parts###

##Hyaline Cartilage##  
Covers joint surfaces and supports smooth motion.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **ease and flow**.

##Elastic Cartilage##  
Forms the ears and parts of the larynx, allowing flexibility.  
Energetically, it reflects **adaptability and receptivity**.

##Fibrocartilage##  
Provides strong cushioning in intervertebral discs.  
Energetically, it represents **stability and grounded support**.

###Function###  
Cartilage absorbs shock, prevents friction, and allows graceful movement.  
Energetically, it maintains **fluid motion and emotional flexibility**.

###Common Imbalances###  
- Stiffness: resistance or emotional rigidity.  
- Softening: lack of structure or boundaries.  
- Injury: imbalance between strength and adaptability.

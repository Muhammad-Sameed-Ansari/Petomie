#Cartilage#

##Location##
Cartilage is a **firm yet flexible connective tissue** found in joints, ears, nose, ribs, larynx, and trachea of cats.  
It supports movement and protects bones by reducing friction in joints.

##Shape##
It is a **smooth, bluish-white tissue** that is slightly flexible and elastic.  
Cartilage has no blood supply, so it heals slowly when damaged.

##Parts (Types of Cartilage)##

###1. Hyaline Cartilage###
- Found in joints, ribs, nose, and trachea.  
- **Function:** Provides smooth surfaces for joint movement and structure for flexible areas.  

###2. Elastic Cartilage###
- Found in the ear and parts of the larynx.  
- **Function:** Allows flexibility and returns to shape after bending.  

###3. Fibrocartilage###
- Found in intervertebral discs and around tendons.  
- **Function:** Absorbs shock and provides firm support in high-pressure areas.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Gives structure and shape to flexible parts of the body.  
- **Protection:** Cushions bones and joints.  
- **Movement:** Reduces friction between bones for smooth motion.  
- **Shock absorption:** Protects joints and spine during movement.

###Meaning & Function###
The Root Chakra forms the foundation of the bird’s physical stability, instinctual security, and connection to its environment.
It governs grounding, flock safety, territorial comfort, and the ability to feel calm and protected.
This chakra supports balance, survival instinct, and steady behavior — essential for flighted animals.

##Connection##
The legs, feet, hips, and lower spine

The cloaca and elimination pathways
The adrenal and instinctual stress-response systems

Comfort in flock dynamics or with trusted humans
Strong vitality and grounded presence even when airborne

###Signs of Imbalance###

Skittishness, fearfulness, or sudden flightiness
Restlessness or inability to settle on a perch

###Balancing Activities###
Provide predictable routines and a safe enclosure or aviary
Offer grounded perches, natural branches, and stable resting spots
Gentle handling, calm presence, and soft vocal reassurance
Allow natural foraging, exploration, and flock bonding
Use grounding energy techniques near the base of the tail (without touching sensitive species)
Place earthy crystals (e.g., smoky quartz, red jasper) near the environment — never attached to the bird

###Meaning & Function###
The Brachial Chakra is the primary human–animal connection chakra in birds.
It governs bonding, emotional safety, trust, and energetic communication.
Through this chakra, birds sense human intention, determine safety, and form relational connections.
It also influences willingness to perch, accept touch, and engage socially.

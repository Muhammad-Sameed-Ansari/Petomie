#Aura Magnitude#

###Location###
Surrounds the bird’s entire body, extending outward from the feathers in a radiant field that expands and contracts based on health, emotional state, and spiritual vitality.
The magnitude is often most noticeable around the wings, tail, and head, where sensory and intuitive energies are strongest.

###Shape###
Oval, luminous, and constantly shifting with movement.
Because birds are highly sensitive, their aura tends to be lighter and more fluid, expanding outward when relaxed and contracting tightly when stressed or alert.

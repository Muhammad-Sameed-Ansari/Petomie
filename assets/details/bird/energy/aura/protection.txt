#Aura Protection#

###Location###
Forms a thin but powerful outer layer surrounding all other aura layers.
In birds, this protective field is especially important around the wings, chest, and crown, where sensory input and intuition are strongest.

###Shape###
A smooth, oval barrier that acts like an energetic shield.
It may appear brighter or more compact during moments requiring heightened awareness or self-protection.

###Meaning & Function###
The Aura Protection layer deflects disruptive energies, emotional residue, or environmental stress before they enter deeper layers.

Functions include:
Shielding from chaotic or overwhelming environments
Maintaining emotional stability
Protecting intuitive centers
Reducing energetic drain from people, animals, or situations

A strong protective layer supports a bird’s confidence, safety, and sense of environmental control.

###Signs of Weak Aura Protection###
Overreactivity
Over-bonding or clinginess
Stress during handling
Energetic drain or fatigue
Difficulty interacting with flock or humans

###Balancing Activities###
Stable perching environments
Predictable routines
Energetic sealing practices around the field
Soft, warm lighting
Soothing sounds or gentle vocal interaction

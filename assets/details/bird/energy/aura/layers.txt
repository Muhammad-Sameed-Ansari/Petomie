#Aura Layers#

###Location###
Surround the bird in multiple concentric layers of subtle energy, each extending outward from the feathers and body.
These layers reflect physical vitality, emotional movement, mental clarity, and spiritual connection, functioning together as a unified energetic system.

###Shape###
Oval, radiant, and constantly shifting with motion.
Each layer vibrates at a unique frequency:

Etheric Layer: Closest to the feathers, mirroring muscles, bones, and wing structure.
Emotional Layer: Slightly outward, showing mood, flock harmony, and relationship with environment.
Mental Layer: Expands with focus, awareness, training, and cognitive activity.
Spiritual Layer: The outermost field, luminous and expansive, connecting the bird to higher consciousness, intuition, and guidance.

When balanced, all layers flow smoothly together, creating a strong, clear, and vibrant energy field.

###Function###

##Etheric Layer##
Mirrors the physical form and energetic vitality,
Carries life force into tissues, wings, and muscles,
Represents overall physical health and responsiveness,
Weakness may appear as fatigue, wing tension, or lowered immunity.

##Emotional Layer##
Holds emotional states and responses,
Shifts with flock dynamics, environmental comfort, or stress,
Bright and flowing when calm, clouded during fear or overwhelm,
Imbalance may cause agitation, withdrawal, or sensitivity to handling.

##Mental Layer##
Carries thought patterns, perception, and awareness,
Supports training, communication, and environmental interpretation,
Balanced when the bird shows curiosity, focus, and adaptability,
Distortion may cause confusion, reactivity, or difficulty focusing.

##Spiritual Layer##
The most expansive and subtle,
Connects the bird to intuition, purpose, and universal consciousness,
Radiates peace, inner clarity, and elevated perception,
Weakness may cause disconnection, fearfulness, or lack of vitality.

#Spinalis Muscle#

The spinalis muscle lies close to the vertebral spines and helps extend and stabilize the upper back and neck.  
It works with other deep muscles to maintain posture and guide coordinated movement.  
Energetically, it represents clarity, uprightness, and steady focus.

###Parts###

##Cervical Spinalis Fibers##  
Support neck extension and alignment.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness and elevated perspective.

##Thoracic Spinalis Fibers##  
Maintain upper‑back posture during flight.  
Energetically, they reflect steadiness and structural clarity.

##Interspinous Support Slips##  
Provide fine adjustments between vertebrae.  
Energetically, they represent subtle correction and inner harmony.

###Function###  
The spinalis supports extension, posture, and coordinated spinal movement.  
Energetically, it strengthens presence, focus, and alignment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: stiff upper back or restricted extension.  
Weakness: poor posture or reduced flight efficiency.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty staying centered or focused.

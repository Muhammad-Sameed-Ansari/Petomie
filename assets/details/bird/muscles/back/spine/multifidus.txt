#Multifidus Muscle#

The bird’s multifidus muscle is a deep spinal stabilizer that connects individual vertebrae along the back.  
It provides fine control, posture stability, and supports coordinated movements during flight and perching.  
Energetically, it represents inner strength, alignment, and refined awareness.

###Parts###

##Cervical Multifidus##  
Stabilizes the neck vertebrae for precise head control.  
Energetically, it symbolizes clarity and conscious perception.

##Thoracic Multifidus##  
Supports mid‑back stability during wing motion.  
Energetically, it reflects balance, flow, and centered strength.

##Lumbar Multifidus##  
Anchors the lower spine for landing, perching, and core control.  
Energetically, it represents grounding and inner resilience.

###Function###  
The multifidus stabilizes the spine, enhances posture, and supports subtle adjustments in movement.  
Energetically, it strengthens inner alignment and controlled flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: poor posture or unstable motion.  
Tension: rigid spine or restricted movement.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect instability or loss of inner center.

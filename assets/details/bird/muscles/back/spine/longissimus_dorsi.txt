#Longissimus Dorsi#

The longissimus dorsi is one of the main extensor muscles along the bird’s spine.  
It helps lift, extend, and stabilize the back during flight, walking, and perching.  
Energetically, it represents support, elevation, and strong direction.

###Parts###

##Thoracic Extensor Fibers##  
Extend and stabilize the mid‑back during wingbeats.  
Energetically, they symbolize rising strength and momentum.

##Lumbar Support Bands##  
Help control trunk stability during landing and stepping.  
Energetically, they reflect grounding and steady progress.

##Sacral Transition Slips##  
Coordinate motion between the spine and pelvis.  
Energetically, they represent integration and balanced flow.

###Function###  
This muscle extends the spine, supports posture, and stabilizes the trunk during movement.  
Energetically, it enhances lift, direction, and structural confidence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: stiff back or difficulty extending.  
Weakness: unstable posture or poor control in flight.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect lowered energy or loss of direction.

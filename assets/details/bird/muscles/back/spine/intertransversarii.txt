#Intertransversarii Muscles#

The intertransversarii are tiny muscles that connect transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae.  
They guide fine lateral and rotational movements of the spine, enhancing flexibility and precision.  
Energetically, they represent subtle awareness, adaptability, and micro‑adjustment in life.

###Parts###

##Cervical Intertransversarii##  
Enable delicate neck tilting and rotation.  
Energetically, they symbolize sensitivity and perceptive flow.

##Thoracic Intertransversarii##  
Guide side‑to‑side balance during wing motion.  
Energetically, they reflect harmony, coordination, and balanced motion.

##Lumbar Intertransversarii##  
Assist pelvic and lower‑spinal adjustments.  
Energetically, they represent grounding and refined stability.

###Function###  
These muscles fine‑tune spinal motion, enhance balance, and support subtle control during flight and perching.  
Energetically, they strengthen adaptability, awareness, and graceful adjustment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: reduced flexibility or discomfort in turning.  
Weakness: instability during fine movements.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty adapting or adjusting.

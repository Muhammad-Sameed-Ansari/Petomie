#Deep Back Muscles#

##Location##
Located adjacent to the vertebrae beneath the intermediate layer, forming the **core spinal support system**.  
Extend from the cervical to the lumbar region.

##Shape##
Composed of **short, dense, and segmented muscles** connecting individual vertebrae.  
They provide fine control of posture and spinal alignment.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidus###
- Series of short muscles connecting vertebral arches.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes and fine-tunes movements of the spine.  

###2. Interspinales###
- Small paired muscles between spinous processes.  
- **Function:** Extend and stabilize the spine.  

###3. Intertransversarii###
- Found between transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Allow lateral flexion and maintain vertebral spacing.  

###4. Spinalis###
- Medial part of the erector spinae.  
- **Function:** Extends the spine and keeps posture upright during standing or flight preparation.

##Function##
- **Stabilization:** Maintains posture and spinal integrity.  
- **Fine Control:** Enables small, precise adjustments during perching and flight.  
- **Extension:** Supports coordinated dorsal extension of the body and neck.

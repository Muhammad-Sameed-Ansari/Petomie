#Back Deep Muscles#

The bird’s deep back muscles lie closest to the spine, forming the core structural support system of the back.  
They stabilize the vertebrae, guide precise movement, and protect the spinal cord during flight and landing.  
Energetically, they represent inner strength, grounding, and resilience.

###Parts###

##Multifidus##  
Supports fine spinal adjustments and stabilizes each vertebra.  
Energetically, it symbolizes inner alignment and subtle strength.

##Spinalis##  
Extends the spine and maintains posture.  
Energetically, it reflects resilience, uprightness, and steady presence.

##Deep Intertransversarii##  
Assist with small lateral and rotational movements of the spine.  
Energetically, they represent flexibility, adaptability, and refined control.

###Function###  
These muscles stabilize the spine, protect neural pathways, and support controlled flight movements.  
Energetically, they anchor inner power, precision, and grounded movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted spinal flexibility or fatigue.  
Weakness: reduced stability and balance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect weakened internal foundation or uncertainty.

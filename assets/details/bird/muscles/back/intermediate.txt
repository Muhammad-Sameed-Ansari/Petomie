#Intermediate Back Muscles#

##Location##
Situated beneath the superficial layer, connecting the **vertebral column to ribs and scapulae**.  
They extend from the neck through the thoracic and lumbar regions.

##Shape##
Thicker and shorter than superficial muscles, composed of **overlapping muscle bundles** that stabilize and assist in controlled movement of the spine and ribs.

##Parts##

###1. Serratus Posterior###
- Lies between superficial and deep back layers.  
- **Function:** Assists in elevating or depressing ribs during respiration.  

###2. Levator Costarum###
- Small muscles between transverse processes and ribs.  
- **Function:** Elevates ribs and aids in inhalation.  

###3. Longissimus Dorsi###
- Long paired muscles running alongside the spine.  
- **Function:** Extends and laterally flexes the vertebral column.  

###4. Iliocostalis###
- Lateral portion of the erector spinae group.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes vertebrae and assists in wing and trunk motion.

##Function##
- **Support:** Reinforces the spine during flight and perching.  
- **Movement:** Controls rib expansion and spinal extension.  
- **Coordination:** Links respiration with body movement.

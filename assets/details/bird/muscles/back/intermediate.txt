#Back Intermediate Muscles#

The bird’s intermediate back muscles form the supportive layer between the superficial and deep groups.  
They coordinate spinal movement, assist with wing control, and maintain midline stability during flight and perching.  
Energetically, they represent balanced flow, integration, and adaptable strength.

###Parts###

##Rhomboideus Group##  
Retracts and stabilizes the shoulder girdle.  
Energetically, it symbolizes inner alignment and supportive focus.

##Serratus Dorsalis##  
Assists with rib movement and breathing rhythm.  
Energetically, it reflects flow, breath, and rhythmic expression.

##Middle Spinal Fibers##  
Provide structural support and coordinate back movement.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and coordinated action.

###Function###  
This muscle layer integrates wing, spine, and rib movement for smooth, controlled flight.  
Energetically, it maintains balance, rhythm, and fluid coordination.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: repetitive motion or twisting during landing.  
Asymmetry: compensation from wing or leg imbalance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disrupted rhythm or uneven flow.

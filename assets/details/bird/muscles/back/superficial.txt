#Superficial Back Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the **dorsal surface of the trunk**, from the neck to the base of the tail.  
These muscles form the **outer layer** of the back and are involved in **wing support, posture, and movement**.

##Shape##
Broad, flat, and thin muscles covering the thoracic and lumbar regions.  
Fibers are oriented longitudinally and obliquely, allowing flexible motion and protection of deeper structures.

##Parts##

###1. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Large triangular muscle extending from the thoracic vertebrae to the humerus.  
- **Function:** Draws the wing backward and downward during flight recovery.  

###2. Trapezius###
- Divided into cervical and thoracic portions along the midline of the back.  
- **Function:** Elevates and stabilizes the scapula; supports wing lifting and alignment.  

###3. Rhomboideus###
- Lies deep to the trapezius between the scapula and spine.  
- **Function:** Retracts the scapula and maintains posture of the upper back.  

###4. Serratus Anterior###
- Originates from the ribs and inserts on the scapula.  
- **Function:** Draws the scapula forward and stabilizes it during wing motion.

##Function##
- **Movement:** Supports wing retraction and elevation.  
- **Stability:** Maintains shoulder blade alignment.  
- **Protection:** Covers and supports the deeper spinal muscles.

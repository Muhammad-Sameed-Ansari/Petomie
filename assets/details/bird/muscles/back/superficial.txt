#Back Superficial Muscles#

The bird’s superficial back muscles form the outermost layer that shapes the upper body and supports broad movements of the wings and spine.  
They stabilize posture, assist with powerful wingbeats, and maintain smooth body control during flight.  
Energetically, they represent outward strength, protection, and graceful expression.

###Parts###

##Latissimus Dorsi##  
A broad muscle aiding wing retraction and back movement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes expansive strength and confident motion.

##Trapezius Group##  
Supports shoulder elevation and stabilizes the upper back.  
Energetically, it reflects openness, presence, and elevated perspective.

##Superficial Spinal Fascia##  
Connective tissue that anchors the upper back and distributes movement forces.  
Energetically, it represents structure, grounding, and continuity.

###Function###  
These muscles guide wing movement, stabilize the back, and support flight posture.  
Energetically, they help express outward power, ease, and aligned direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: overuse from strong wingbeats.  
Weakness: reduced lifting power or instability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty expressing strength or carrying burdens.

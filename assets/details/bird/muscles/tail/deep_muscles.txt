#Tail Deep Muscles#

The deep tail muscles lie close to the vertebrae, stabilizing the tail and enabling strong, controlled movement.  
They support posture, flight corrections, and coordinated tail–spine motion.  
Energetically, they represent inner structure, grounded alignment, and stability.

###Parts###

##Interspinales Caudae##  
Assist fine adjustments between tail vertebrae.  
Energetically, they symbolize precision, awareness, and subtle correction.

##Multifidus Caudae##  
Stabilizes the tail and spine through segmental control.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, resilience, and core stability.

##Deep Rotator Slips##  
Allow rotational and torsional tail movement.  
Energetically, they reflect adaptability, refinement, and fluid structural alignment.

###Function###  
Deep tail muscles support spinal alignment, tail strength, and stability during flight and perching.  
Energetically, they provide foundation, inner steadiness, and structural harmony.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: poor stability or reduced steering force.  
Stiffness: limited rotation or rigid posture.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect weakened inner foundation or inflexibility.

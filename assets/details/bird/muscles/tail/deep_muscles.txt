#Tail Muscles – Deep Layer#

##Location##
Situated at the **base of the tail**, surrounding the **coccygeal vertebrae**.  
These muscles form the **inner structural layer** that stabilizes and supports tail movement.

###Shape###
Composed of **short, thick, and interwoven fibers** anchored to the vertebrae and pelvic bones.  
Designed for **precision, strength, and stability** in tail control.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidus Caudae###
- Small paired muscles between coccygeal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes tail base and fine-tunes vertebral alignment.  

###2. Intertransversarii Caudae###
- Connects transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Controls small lateral tail movements.  

###3. Spinalis Caudae###
- Runs along the midline of the tail’s dorsal surface.  
- **Function:** Extends and raises the tail slightly during balance adjustments.  

##Function##
- **Stabilization:** Maintains vertebral alignment and tail posture.  
- **Balance:** Provides steady control during flight and perching.  
- **Precision:** Allows fine adjustments of tail feathers for steering.

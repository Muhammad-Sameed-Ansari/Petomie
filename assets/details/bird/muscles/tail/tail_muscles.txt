#Tail Muscles#

##Location##
Located at the **posterior end of the trunk**, attaching to the **pygostyle and coccygeal vertebrae**.  
They control movement of the **tail feathers (rectrices)** used for flight stability and communication.

###Shape###
Moderately sized, **fan-shaped muscles** radiating from the pygostyle to the tail base.  
Adapted for strength and smooth feather control.

##Parts##

###1. Levator Caudae###
- Dorsal muscle group above the tail base.  
- **Function:** Elevates the tail and assists in lifting feathers during flight.  

###2. Depressor Caudae###
- Ventral muscle running beneath the tail.  
- **Function:** Lowers the tail and helps control downward movements.  

###3. Lateralis Caudae###
- Positioned on the sides of the tail.  
- **Function:** Moves the tail laterally for steering and communication.  

###4. Coccygeosacralis###
- Extends between the sacrum and first coccygeal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Anchors the tail to the body and supports stability.  

##Function##
- **Movement:** Elevates, depresses, and moves the tail side to side.  
- **Flight Control:** Adjusts tail feathers for steering and braking.  
- **Communication:** Expresses emotion and behavioral cues.

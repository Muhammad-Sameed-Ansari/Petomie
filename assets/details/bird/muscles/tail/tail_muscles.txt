#Tail Muscles#

The bird’s tail muscles guide balance, steering, braking, and subtle adjustments during flight and perching.  
They control tail feather spread, lift, and rotation, helping stabilize the entire body in motion.  
Energetically, they represent direction, balance, and the ability to navigate life with precision.

###Parts###

##Levator Caudae##  
Raises the tail and supports controlled elevation.  
Energetically, it symbolizes uplift, clarity, and rising perspective.

##Depressor Caudae##  
Lowers the tail for braking and landing adjustments.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding, intentional slowing, and safe transitions.

##Lateroflexor Caudae##  
Turns the tail side to side for steering.  
Energetically, it represents adaptability, flow, and responsive movement.

###Function###  
Tail muscles support flight maneuvering, balance during perching, and communication through feather positioning.  
Energetically, they guide direction, alignment, and instinctive correction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: reduced steering or awkward landings.  
Weakness: instability in balance or takeoff.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect uncertainty or difficulty navigating change.

#Tail Muscles – Superficial Layer#

##Location##
Forms the **outer layer** of the tail region, lying above the deep stabilizing muscles.  
Covers the **pygostyle and rectricial bulb**, responsible for **visible feather movement**.

###Shape###
Flat, thin, and flexible muscle sheet covering the tail base.  
Fibers connect to the **skin and feather shafts**, allowing coordinated motion of the rectrices.

##Parts##

###1. Rectricialis Lateralis###
- Thin lateral muscle attached to the rectricial bulb.  
- **Function:** Spreads and retracts outer tail feathers.  

###2. Rectricialis Dorsalis###
- Covers the dorsal surface of the tail.  
- **Function:** Lifts and fans tail feathers during flight.  

###3. Rectricialis Ventralis###
- Ventral surface muscle beneath the tail base.  
- **Function:** Lowers and folds feathers during rest or landing.  

##Function##
- **Feather Movement:** Controls spreading, folding, and angling of tail feathers.  
- **Flight Stability:** Balances airflow and direction during gliding.  
- **Display:** Aids in visual signaling and mating displays.

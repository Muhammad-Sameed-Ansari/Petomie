#Primary Feather Depressors#

Primary feather depressors lower and streamline the primary feathers for speed, efficiency, and strong wingbeats.  
They help the bird reduce drag and create a smooth aerodynamic surface.  
Energetically, they represent focus, direction, and purposeful movement.

###Parts###

##Feather Root Depressor Slips##  
Lower feathers at the base for speed.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding and focused intent.

##Distal Feather Streamliners##  
Smooth the outer wing surface.  
Energetically, they reflect clarity and aligned motion.

##Airflow Stabilization Bands##  
Support feather rigidity during strong flapping.  
Energetically, they represent strength, resolve, and steady direction.

###Function###  
These muscles streamline the wing, reduce drag, and increase efficiency during fast flight.  
Energetically, they support focused action and forward momentum.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: poor speed control.  
Tension: stiff outer wing.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty moving forward smoothly.

#Tensor Propatagialis#

The tensor propatagialis is a key muscle that tensions the propatagium, the wing membrane along the leading edge.  
It shapes the aerodynamic profile of the wing during flight and stabilizes the wrist and forearm.  
Energetically, it represents direction, flow, and the ability to move smoothly through life.

###Parts###

##Proximal Tendon Fibers##  
Tension the leading-edge membrane for lift.  
Energetically, they symbolize guidance and aligned flow.

##Distal Wing Slips##  
Adjust wrist angle and refine airfoil shape.  
Energetically, they reflect adaptability and subtle control.

##Membrane Support Bands##  
Support smooth stretch and recoil of the propatagium.  
Energetically, they represent flexibility and resilience.

###Function###  
This muscle tensions the propatagium, supporting lift, glide stability, and smooth transitions.  
Energetically, it enhances fluidity, direction, and intuitive movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: reduced glide efficiency.  
Weakness: unstable wrist or leading-edge flutter.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty guiding or flowing smoothly.

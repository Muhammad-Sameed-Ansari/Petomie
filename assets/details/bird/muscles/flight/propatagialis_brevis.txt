#Propatagialis Brevis#

The propatagialis brevis works with the longus to tension the leading-edge membrane but focuses on fine adjustments.  
It allows quick changes in wing shape for maneuvering and landing.  
Energetically, it represents agility, finesse, and responsive flow.

###Parts###

##Short Leading-Edge Fibers##  
Enable quick adjustments in membrane tension.  
Energetically, they symbolize nimbleness and awareness.

##Wrist-Modulating Slips##  
Fine-tune wrist position during turning.  
Energetically, they reflect responsiveness and delicate control.

##Inner Membrane Bands##  
Stabilize subtle shifts in wing curvature.  
Energetically, they represent subtle perception and fine flow.

###Function###  
This muscle refines wing shape during turns, landings, and rapid adjustments.  
Energetically, it enhances agility, subtlety, and intuitive response.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: poor maneuverability.  
Weakness: delayed response in turning.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitance or loss of agility.

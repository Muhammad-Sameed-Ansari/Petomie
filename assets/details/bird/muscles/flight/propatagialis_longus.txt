#Propatagialis Longus#

The propatagialis longus extends along the wing’s leading edge and helps stretch the propatagium during flight.  
It stabilizes the wing during fast flapping and controls air flow along the forelimb.  
Energetically, it represents forward momentum and sustained flow.

###Parts###

##Cranial Leading-Edge Fibers##  
Maintain tension along the wing front.  
Energetically, they symbolize purpose and direction.

##Distal Extension Fibers##  
Support wrist stabilization during speed.  
Energetically, they reflect endurance and consistent effort.

##Propatagial Reinforcement Slips##  
Prevent membrane collapse during powerful strokes.  
Energetically, they represent strength and forward drive.

###Function###  
This muscle provides strong, consistent tension to maintain aerodynamic shape.  
Energetically, it supports sustained movement and stable direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Fatigue: loss of leading-edge control.  
Asymmetry: uneven airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect wavering focus.

#Primary Feather Erectors#

Primary feather erectors lift and spread the primary flight feathers for braking, steering, and communication.  
They allow fine aerodynamic adjustments essential for maneuvering and display.  
Energetically, they represent expression, expansion, and confident presence.

###Parts###

##Proximal Feather Base Lifters##  
Raise feathers at the base for increased drag or signaling.  
Energetically, they symbolize rising expression and openness.

##Distal Feather Angle Adjusters##  
Fine-tune feather tilt for steering.  
Energetically, they reflect precision and directional clarity.

##Lateral Fan Spreaders##  
Spread primaries for braking or display communication.  
Energetically, they represent confidence and expressive expansion.

###Function###  
These muscles lift, spread, and angle primary feathers for control and communication.  
Energetically, they enhance expression, clarity, and directional control.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: poor braking or steering.  
Weakness: reduced feather lift.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty expressing or directing energy.

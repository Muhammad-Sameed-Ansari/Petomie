#Ulnaris Propatagialis#

The ulnaris propatagialis connects the propatagium to the ulna and helps control wing flexion.  
It contributes to wrist and elbow coordination during flapping and gliding.  
Energetically, it represents cooperation, integration, and harmonious movement.

###Parts###

##Ulna-Tensioning Fibers##  
Coordinate forearm movement with membrane stretch.  
Energetically, they symbolize unity and integrated action.

##Flexion Control Bands##  
Adjust membrane tension during wing folding.  
Energetically, they reflect adaptability and smooth transitions.

##Supportive Connective Slips##  
Assist fine control of airfoil shape.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and balanced flow.

###Function###  
This muscle coordinates wing folding, membrane control, and smooth transitions between motions.  
Energetically, it supports integrated flow and harmonious movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: poor folding coordination.  
Tightness: rigid forearm transitions.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disharmony or lack of integration.

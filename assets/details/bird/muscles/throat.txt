#Throat Muscles – Avian#

##Location##
Situated in the ventral neck and pharyngeal region of birds, surrounding the hyoid apparatus, laryngeal structures, and proximal trachea. These muscles coordinate swallowing, vocalization, and tongue movement.

###Components###
Muscles associated with the hyoid skeleton, pharyngeal walls, and the avian syrinx.

##Parts##

###1. M. Branchiomandibularis###
- Extends from the mandible to the hyoid bones.  
- **Function:** Retracts the tongue and aids in swallowing.

###2. M. Serpihyoideus###
- Connects the sternum to the hyoid apparatus.  
- **Function:** Draws the hyoid caudally during tongue retraction.

###3. M. Stylohyoideus###
- Runs between the dorsal hyoid elements and the skull.  
- **Function:** Elevates and stabilizes the hyoid during feeding and vocalization.

###4. M. Genioglossus###
- From the mandible to the tongue base.  
- **Function:** Protrudes the tongue; controls tongue tip movement.

###5. M. Hyoglossus###
- From the hyoid to the tongue.  
- **Function:** Retracts the tongue and shapes it during swallowing.

###6. M. Sternohyoideus###
- Extends from the sternum to the hyoid apparatus.  
- **Function:** Depresses the tongue and hyoid during swallowing.

###7. M. Tracheolateralis###
- From the tracheal rings to the syrinx.  
- **Function:** Modulates tension of the syrinx during sound production.

###8. M. Sternotrachealis###
- From sternum to tracheal sides.  
- **Function:** Constricts trachea and adjusts syrinx positioning during phonation.

##Function##
Coordinate swallowing and tongue retraction through hyoid and pharyngeal control.  
Assist in feeding, preening, and vocalization by regulating the syrinx and airway.  
Provide precise modulation of airflow and sound in songbirds and other avian species.

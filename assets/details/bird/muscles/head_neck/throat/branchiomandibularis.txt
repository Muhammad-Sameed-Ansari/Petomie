#M. Branchiomandibularis#

The branchiomandibularis muscle connects the mandible to the hyoid bones and plays a key role in tongue retraction and swallowing.  
It supports coordinated feeding movements and stabilizes the hyoid during retraction.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, release, and the ability to draw inward what is needed.

###Parts###

##Mandibular Origin Fibers##  
Anchor at the mandible to pull the hyoid caudally.  
Energetically, they symbolize intention and directed motion.

##Hyoid Insertion Slips##  
Attach to the hyoid bones for precise tongue retraction.  
Energetically, they reflect focused action and clarity.

##Supportive Connective Bands##  
Assist smooth contraction and hyoid alignment.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and coordinated flow.

###Function###  
This muscle retracts the tongue and aids in swallowing.  
Energetically, it supports inward movement, nourishment, and measured response.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: difficulty swallowing or stiff tongue base.  
Weakness: reduced tongue retraction.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitation or difficulty drawing inward.

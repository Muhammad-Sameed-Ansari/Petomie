#M. Stylohyoideus#

The stylohyoideus runs between the skull and the dorsal hyoid elements.  
It elevates and stabilizes the hyoid during feeding, swallowing, and vocalization.  
Energetically, it represents lift, clarity, and balanced expression.

###Parts###

##Cranial Origin Fibers##  
Arise from the skull to elevate the hyoid.  
Energetically, they symbolize insight and upward movement.

##Dorsal Hyoid Slips##  
Attach to dorsal hyoid bones for stable elevation.  
Energetically, they reflect harmony and alignment.

##Stabilizing Connective Bands##  
Help maintain hyoid position during motion.  
Energetically, they represent steadiness and centered presence.

###Function###  
This muscle elevates and stabilizes the hyoid during feeding and vocalization.  
Energetically, it supports clear expression and balanced intention.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: difficulty elevating the hyoid or throat stiffness.  
Weakness: unstable hyoid during swallowing.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect unclear expression or disrupted harmony.

#M. Hyoglossus#

The hyoglossus connects the hyoid apparatus to the tongue, serving as a major retractor.  
It shapes the tongue during swallowing and coordinates backward motion.  
Energetically, it represents inward reflection, grounding, and integration.

###Parts###

##Hyoid Origin Fibers##  
Pull the tongue backward during swallowing.  
Energetically, they symbolize inward motion and consolidation.

##Tongue Body Slips##  
Shape the tongue for controlled movement.  
Energetically, they reflect refinement and subtle awareness.

##Deep Support Bands##  
Stabilize tongue motion with the hyoid.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and centered flow.

###Function###  
This muscle retracts and shapes the tongue during feeding and swallowing.  
Energetically, it supports reflection, grounding, and inner processing.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: trouble retracting the tongue.  
Weakness: difficulty swallowing effectively.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty processing or integrating.

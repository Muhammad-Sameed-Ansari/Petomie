#M. Sternotrachealis#

The sternotrachealis extends from the sternum to the sides of the trachea.  
It constricts the tracheal rings and fine-tunes syrinx positioning during vocalization.  
Energetically, it represents controlled expression, breath alignment, and focused intention.

###Parts###

##Sternal Origin Slips##  
Anchor the muscle for precise tracheal pull.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding and stability.

##Tracheal Insertion Fibers##  
Adjust tracheal tension to influence the syrinx.  
Energetically, they reflect direction and expressive focus.

##Supportive Lateral Bands##  
Aid coordination of both tracheal sides.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and balanced communication.

###Function###  
This muscle constricts the trachea and stabilizes the syrinx during phonation.  
Energetically, it enhances vocal focus, clarity, and breath alignment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: restricted airflow or strained voice.  
Weakness: unstable vocal control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty aligning voice and intention.

#M. Serpihyoideus#

The serpihyoideus links the sternum to the hyoid apparatus and helps draw the hyoid caudally during tongue retraction.  
It coordinates swallowing, feeding, and hyoid stability.  
Energetically, it represents release, grounding, and steady flow.

###Parts###

##Sternal Origin Fibers##  
Anchor at the sternum to pull the hyoid backward.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding and purposeful motion.

##Caudal Hyoid Slips##  
Attach to the hyoid for coordinated retraction.  
Energetically, they reflect flow and connection.

##Support Bands##  
Maintain smooth movement during swallowing.  
Energetically, they represent integration and stability.

###Function###  
This muscle retracts the hyoid and assists with swallowing motions.  
Energetically, it supports grounded release and fluid transitions.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: difficulty with tongue movement.  
Weakness: ineffective hyoid retraction.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect resistance to letting go.

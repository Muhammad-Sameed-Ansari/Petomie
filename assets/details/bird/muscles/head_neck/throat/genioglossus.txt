#M. Genioglossus#

The genioglossus extends from the mandible to the tongue base and is the primary protractor of the tongue.  
It controls tongue extension, shaping, and fine tip movement.  
Energetically, it represents expression, exploration, and reaching outward.

###Parts###

##Mandibular Origin Bands##  
Provide strong forward pull for tongue protrusion.  
Energetically, they symbolize initiative and outward expression.

##Tongue Base Slips##  
Guide shaping and fine tongue control.  
Energetically, they reflect clarity and precision.

##Midline Support Fibers##  
Maintain structural stability during movement.  
Energetically, they represent balance and aligned communication.

###Function###  
This muscle protrudes the tongue and helps with fine movement and shaping.  
Energetically, it enhances expressive ability and outward exploration.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: reduced tongue extension.  
Tension: restricted movement or stiff tip control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked expression or hesitation.

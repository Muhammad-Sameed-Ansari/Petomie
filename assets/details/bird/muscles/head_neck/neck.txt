#Neck Muscles – Avian#

##Location##
Extend from the caudal skull to the thoracic inlet along the numerous cervical vertebrae of birds. Form dorsal, lateral, and ventral layers surrounding the cervical column.

###Components###
Dorsal extensors, ventral flexors, and lateral stabilizers/rotators providing large-range motion and fine segmental control.

##Parts##

###1. Biventer Cervicis###
- Superficial dorsal muscle spanning multiple cervical segments.  
- **Function:** Extends the head and neck.

###2. Complexus###
- Dorsolateral to biventer cervicis.  
- **Function:** Extends and stabilizes the cranio‑cervical junction.

###3. Splenius Capitis###
- Dorsolateral cervical region.  
- **Function:** Extends and laterally flexes the neck.

###4. Longus Colli Dorsalis###
- Deep dorsal series along cervical vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Segmental extension and stabilization.

###5. Longus Colli Ventralis###
- Deep ventral cervical column.  
- **Function:** Flexes the neck and stabilizes ventrally.

###6. Intertransversarii Cervicis###
- Between transverse processes.  
- **Function:** Fine lateral flexion and segmental control.

###7. Interspinales Cervicis###
- Between cervical spinous processes.  
- **Function:** Assist in extension and midline stability.

##Function##
Provide wide‑range cervical mobility with precise segmental control for feeding, preening, visual tracking, head stabilization, and balance during flight and perching.

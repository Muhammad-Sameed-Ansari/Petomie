#Neck Muscles#

The bird’s neck muscles form a highly flexible, coordinated system that stabilizes the head, guides feeding, and maintains balance during flight and perching.  
Their long, segmented structure allows birds exceptional precision and range of motion.  
Energetically, they represent adaptability, perception, and the connection between thought and action.

###Parts###

##Longus Colli##  
A deep muscle guiding fine neck adjustments and supporting vertebral stability.  
Energetically, it symbolizes inner guidance and alignment.

##Cervical Interspinales##  
Small muscles between vertebrae that enable precise, controlled motion.  
Energetically, they reflect awareness, detail, and refined perception.

##Cervical Extensors##  
Lift and extend the head, supporting posture during flight and observation.  
Energetically, they represent alertness, clarity, and elevated perspective.

##Cervical Flexors##  
Bend the neck forward for feeding, grooming, and ground interaction.  
Energetically, they symbolize humility, connection, and attentive focus.

###Function###  
Neck muscles stabilize the head, guide feeding movements, and maintain balance through coordinated, flexible control.  
Energetically, they support perception, adaptability, and the harmonious connection between awareness and movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: fatigue or restricted movement.  
Weakness: imbalance affecting posture or precision.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty adjusting, perceiving, or responding to situations.

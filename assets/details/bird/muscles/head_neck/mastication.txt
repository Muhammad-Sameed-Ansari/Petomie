#Mastication Muscles#

The bird’s mastication muscles control the movement of the beak, enabling pecking, biting, grinding, and food manipulation.  
They provide the strength and precision required for feeding styles across species.  
Energetically, they represent nourishment, decisiveness, and the processing of life experiences.

###Parts###

##Adductor Mandibulae##  
The primary jaw-closing muscle responsible for powerful beak closure.  
Energetically, it symbolizes determination and focused action.

##Pterygoideus Group##  
Controls side-to-side and rotational beak movements for grinding and manipulating food.  
Energetically, it reflects adaptability and flexibility in processing.

##Depressor Mandibulae##  
Opens the lower beak, supporting breathing and vocalization.  
Energetically, it represents release, expression, and openness.

###Function###  
These muscles enable biting, cracking, grinding, and fine manipulation of food.  
Energetically, they support nourishment, decision-making, and expression through voice and feeding behavior.

###Common Imbalances###  
Jaw tension: stress or repetitive pecking.  
Weakness: reduced grip strength or difficulty feeding.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty “processing” or expressing needs.

#Iliacus Muscle#

The bird’s iliacus muscle lies along the inner surface of the pelvis and helps draw the femur forward.  
It supports leg motion during walking, landing, and climbing.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, movement initiation, and steady progress.

###Parts###

##Pelvic Origin Fibers##  
Anchor inside the ilium for strong leverage.  
Energetically, they symbolize stability and rooted intention.

##Femoral Insertion Slips##  
Guide forward movement of the thigh.  
Energetically, they reflect direction, momentum, and flow.

##Medial Support Bands##  
Provide balance and prevent excessive inward rotation.  
Energetically, they represent centered movement and aligned purpose.

###Function###  
The iliacus flexes the hip, stabilizes the pelvis, and supports forward stepping.  
Energetically, it helps initiate grounded, purposeful motion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted stride or stiff landing.  
Weakness: reduced stability during takeoff.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitation or weakened grounding.

The iliotrochantericus is a strong pelvic muscle that lifts and rotates the femur.  
It supports takeoff power, climbing, and rapid directional changes.  
Energetically, it represents momentum, agility, and decisive movement.

###Parts###

##Cranial Iliac Fibers##  
Lift the femur during forward movement.  
Energetically, they symbolize rising energy and determination.

##Trochanteric Insertion Slips##  
Attach to the upper femur for effective rotation.  
Energetically, they reflect direction and purposeful flow.

##Deep Stabilizing Bands##  
Maintain hip stability during strong motion.  
Energetically, they represent inner balance and confident action.

###Function###  
This muscle elevates and rotates the thigh, enabling powerful movement.

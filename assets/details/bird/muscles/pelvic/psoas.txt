#Psoas Muscle#

The bird’s psoas muscle forms a deep connection between the spine and femur, supporting hip flexion and core stability.  
It coordinates with abdominal and pelvic muscles for smooth, controlled motion.  
Energetically, it represents inner strength, alignment, and emotional balance.

###Parts###

##Lumbar Origin Fibers##  
Attach to vertebrae, stabilizing the spine during movement.  
Energetically, they symbolize inner structure and resilience.

##Deep Hip Flexor Slips##  
Assist in lifting the leg during walking or perching.  
Energetically, they reflect forward movement and adaptability.

##Pelvic Transition Fibers##  
Blend with pelvic fascia for coordinated motion.  
Energetically, they represent integration and balanced flow.

###Function###  
The psoas stabilizes the spine, flexes the hip, and coordinates trunk–leg motion.  
Energetically, it supports centered movement and emotional grounding.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: stiff gait or difficulty perching.  
Weakness: unstable hip or poor leg lift.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect emotional tension or weakened inner alignment.

#Obturator Muscles#

The obturator muscles lie along the pelvic opening and rotate the femur, guiding precise leg orientation.  
They stabilize the hip joint during standing, walking, and landing.  
Energetically, they represent direction, orientation, and clear intention.

###Parts###

##Obturator Internus##  
Rotates the femur outward for controlled foot placement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes clarity and decisive movement.

##Obturator Externus##  
Provides inward rotation and hip stability.  
Energetically, it reflects balance and adaptive direction.

##Pelvic Support Fascia##  
Connective fibers that anchor the muscles to the pelvic walls.  
Energetically, they represent grounding and structural harmony.

###Function###  
These muscles rotate and stabilize the hip, supporting balance and coordinated leg placement.  
Energetically, they help birds orient themselves with precision and confidence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted rotation or poor balance.  
Weakness: unstable limb orientation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect lack of direction or unsettled focus.

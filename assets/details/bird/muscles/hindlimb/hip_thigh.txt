#Hindlimb Muscles – Hip & Thigh (Avian)#

##Location##
Located between the pelvis and the knee joint, surrounding the femur and articulating with the ilium, ischium, and pubis. These muscles form the main mass of the avian hindlimb.

###Components###
Comprise extensors and flexors of the hip and knee, abductors, adductors, and rotators, contributing to walking, perching, and takeoff power.

##Parts##

###1. M. Iliotibialis Lateralis###
- From ilium to tibia.  
- **Function:** Extends the knee and stabilizes the thigh during stance and locomotion.

###2. M. Femorotibialis (lateralis, medialis, intermedius)###
- From femur to tibial crest.  
- **Function:** Primary extensor of the knee joint; supports propulsion during walking and takeoff.

###3. M. Caudofemoralis###
- From caudal vertebrae to femur.  
- **Function:** Retracts the thigh and assists in limb extension.

###4. M. Obturatorius (externus and internus)###
- Around the obturator foramen.  
- **Function:** Rotates the femur laterally and stabilizes the hip joint.

###5. M. Puboischiofemoralis###
- From pubis and ischium to femur.  
- **Function:** Flexes and adducts the thigh.

###6. M. Iliotrochantericus###
- From ilium to greater trochanter of the femur.  
- **Function:** Flexes the thigh and stabilizes the hip during flight or landing.

##Function##
Extend, flex, and rotate the hip and knee joints.  
Provide power for takeoff, walking, perching, and controlled landing.  
Maintain posture and balance by stabilizing the pelvis and femur.

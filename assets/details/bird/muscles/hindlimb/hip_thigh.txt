#Hindlimb Hip and Thigh Muscles#

The bird’s hip and thigh muscles form the powerful foundation of the hindlimb.  
They provide strength for takeoff, landing, perching, walking, and stabilizing the body during movement.  
Energetically, they represent momentum, grounding, and the balance between power and grace.

###Parts###

##Gluteus Group##  
Supports hip extension and stabilizes the pelvis during movement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes strength, propulsion, and confident forward motion.

##Iliotibialis##  
A broad thigh muscle essential for standing, perching, and walking.  
Energetically, it reflects support, balance, and steady presence.

##Caudofemoralis##  
Assists with leg retraction and tail–leg coordination.  
Energetically, it represents connection, rhythm, and coordinated action.

###Function###  
These muscles power walking, jumping, and controlled landings, while stabilizing the hip and thigh.  
Energetically, they support grounded movement, steady progress, and harmonious strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: difficulty with balance or takeoff.  
Tension: overuse from repeated landing or climbing.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect instability or hesitance in moving forward.

#Hindlimb Muscles – Crus (Avian)#

##Location##
Located in the lower leg (shank) between the knee and the ankle joint, surrounding the tibiotarsus and fibula.

###Components###
Include the flexors and extensors of the tarsus and digits, contributing to propulsion, balance, and perching stability.

##Parts##

###1. M. Gastrocnemius###
- From femoral condyles and tendon of femorotibialis to the Achilles tendon and tarsometatarsus.  
- **Function:** Extends the tarsus and aids in propulsion during walking and takeoff.

###2. M. Tibialis Cranialis###
- From tibia to tarsometatarsus.  
- **Function:** Flexes the tarsus and elevates the foot during swing phase.

###3. M. Flexor Digitorum Longus###
- From posterior tibia to digital phalanges.  
- **Function:** Flexes the toes and maintains grip during perching.

###4. M. Flexor Hallucis Longus###
- From fibula and tibia to hallux and digits.  
- **Function:** Flexes the hallux and contributes to grasping and landing control.

###5. M. Extensor Digitorum Longus###
- From lateral femoral condyle to digits.  
- **Function:** Extends the toes and stabilizes the foot during stance.

###6. M. Peroneus Longus###
- From fibula to tarsometatarsus.  
- **Function:** Flexes and everts the tarsus; stabilizes the foot laterally.

##Function##
Provide extension and flexion of the tarsus and digits for walking, landing, and takeoff.  
Enable gripping and shock absorption during perching and locomotion.

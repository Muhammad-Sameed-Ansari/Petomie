#Hindlimb Crus Muscles#

The crus muscles form the lower leg region between the knee and the ankle.  
They provide leverage, support perching actions, and help control foot movement during walking and landing.  
Energetically, they represent adaptability, precision, and stable progression.

###Parts###

##Gastrocnemius##  
A major extensor of the ankle, essential for jumping and push-off.  
Energetically, it symbolizes power, lift, and upward movement.

##Flexor Digitorum Longus##  
Controls toe flexion and gripping during perching.  
Energetically, it reflects connection, grounding, and secure attachment.

##Tibialis Cranialis##  
Aids in lifting the foot and stabilizing the lower limb.  
Energetically, it represents clarity, direction, and smooth transitions.

###Function###  
These muscles guide lower leg motion, support perching grip, and stabilize the limb during landing and walking.  
Energetically, they support focus, adaptability, and secure movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: overuse from gripping or repetitive landing.  
Weakness: reduced stability or climbing ability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty holding on or maintaining direction.

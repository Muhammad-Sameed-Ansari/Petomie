#Hindlimb Muscles – Pes (Avian)#

##Location##
Located in the distal limb (foot), surrounding the tarsometatarsus and digits. Responsible for grasping, perching, and locomotion.

###Components###
Intrinsic muscles of the foot and tendinous continuations of crus muscles controlling digital movement.

##Parts##

###1. M. Flexor Digitorum Brevis###
- From tarsometatarsus to middle phalanges.  
- **Function:** Flexes the digits; maintains grip during perching.

###2. M. Extensor Digitorum Brevis###
- Dorsal tarsometatarsus to proximal phalanges.  
- **Function:** Extends the toes and stabilizes the foot dorsally.

###3. M. Flexor Hallucis Brevis###
- From plantar surface to hallux.  
- **Function:** Flexes the hallux and enhances grasping strength.

###4. M. Abductor Digiti II and IV###
- From plantar fascia to corresponding digits.  
- **Function:** Spread or stabilize toes during landing and grasping.

###5. M. Interossei###
- Between metatarsals.  
- **Function:** Fine control of toe position and pressure distribution.

##Function##
Provide digital control for grasping branches and prey.  
Stabilize the foot during perching, walking, and landing.  
Coordinate with crus tendons for automatic toe flexion when perching (the “perching mechanism”).

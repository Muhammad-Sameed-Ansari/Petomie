#Hindlimb Pes Muscles#

The pes muscles include the intricate muscles of the foot and toes.  
They allow birds to perch securely, grasp branches, walk with precision, and absorb impact during landing.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, contact, and the ability to connect with one’s environment.

###Parts###

##Flexor Hallucis Longus##  
Flexes the toes for gripping and perching.  
Energetically, it symbolizes connection, security, and rootedness.

##Interosseous Muscles##  
Stabilize the toes and assist with fine motor control.  
Energetically, they reflect coordination, sensitivity, and awareness.

##Extensor Digitorum Longus##  
Extends the toes, aiding in balance and forward stepping.  
Energetically, it represents direction, clarity, and expressive movement.

###Function###  
These muscles guide toe control, grip strength, and balance during perching and locomotion.  
Energetically, they support grounding, connection, and steady engagement with the world.

###Common Imbalances###  
Toe strain: excessive gripping or uneven surfaces.  
Weak grip: difficulty perching or maintaining stability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect weakened grounding or unstable connection.

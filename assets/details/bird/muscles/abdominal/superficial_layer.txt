#Abdominal Muscles – Superficial Layer (Avian)#

##Location##
Forms the outermost muscular layer of the lateral thoraco‑abdominal wall in birds, extending from the caudal ribs toward the pelvis.

###Components###
Thin sheets covering the flanks and contributing to the abdominal wall envelope.

##Parts##

###1. M. Obliquus Externus Abdominis###
- Fibers run caudoventrally over the lateral abdomen; attaches to ribs and aponeurosis.  
- **Function:** Compresses the abdomen; assists trunk flexion and rib motion during breathing.

###2. Superficial Aponeurosis (External Oblique Aponeurosis)###
- Broad tendinous sheet continuing from the muscle into the ventral abdominal wall.  
- **Function:** Reinforces the abdominal sheath and contributes to the linea alba.

##Function##
Provide the first protective layer for viscera, assist expiration by abdominal compression, and support trunk movements and posture.

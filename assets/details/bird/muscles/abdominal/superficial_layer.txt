#Abdominal Superficial Layer#

The bird’s superficial abdominal layer forms the outer protective sheet of the core.  
It supports trunk movement, stabilizes posture during flight and perching, and protects internal organs.  
Energetically, it represents outward strength, protection, and confident expression.

###Parts###

##External Abdominal Oblique##  
A wide, diagonal muscle covering the sides of the abdomen.  
Energetically, it symbolizes outer stability and strength in motion.

##Lateral Fibers##  
Support twisting, bending, and coordinated wing–body movements.  
Energetically, they represent flexibility and flow.

##Superficial Fascia##  
Connective tissue that stabilizes the outer abdominal wall.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and structural presence.

###Function###  
This layer supports bending, rotation, and posture, especially during wingbeats and perching.  
Energetically, it stabilizes outward expression and maintains protective strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: overuse from flight or sudden movement.  
Weakness: reduced support or instability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect defensiveness or weakened outer boundaries.

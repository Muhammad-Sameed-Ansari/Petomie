#Abdominal Muscles – Middle Layer (Avian)#

##Location##
Lies beneath the superficial layer along the lateral abdominal wall, spanning between the caudal ribs and pelvic girdle.

###Components###
Intermediate oblique fibers that interdigitate with superficial and deep layers via their aponeuroses.

##Parts##

###1. M. Obliquus Internus Abdominis###
- Fibers run cranioventrally; inserts into a ventral aponeurosis and the linea alba.  
- **Function:** Assists abdominal compression, trunk rotation, and stabilization of the abdominal wall.

###2. Intermediate Aponeurosis###
- Tendinous sheet blending with the rectus sheath.  
- **Function:** Transmits muscle force and strengthens the ventral abdominal fascia.

##Function##
Reinforce the abdominal wall, aid controlled trunk rotation and stabilization, and assist ventilatory mechanics with the rib cage and air‑sac system.

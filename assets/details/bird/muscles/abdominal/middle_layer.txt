#Abdominal Middle Layer#

The bird’s middle abdominal layer forms the deeper diagonal support sheet.  
It assists with breathing, rotation, and coordinated core control during flight and landing.  
Energetically, it represents balanced flow, adaptability, and inner alignment.

###Parts###

##Internal Abdominal Oblique##  
A diagonal muscle that assists rotation and supports trunk stability.  
Energetically, it symbolizes centered movement and fluid adaptability.

##Intermediate Fibers##  
Link superficial and deep layers for coordinated strength.  
Energetically, they reflect connection and harmony.

##Supporting Fascia##  
Provides stability and distributes force across the core.  
Energetically, it represents integration and balanced structure.

###Function###  
This layer guides rotational control, secures posture, and supports breathing rhythm.  
Energetically, it maintains internal harmony and smooth energetic flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: twisting or landing force.  
Asymmetry: compensation from wing or leg issues.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disrupted flow or scattered focus.

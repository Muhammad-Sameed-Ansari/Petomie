#Abdominal Muscles – Ventral Wall (Avian)#

##Location##
Ventral abdominal floor extending between the costal arch and the pubic region, composed of the fused aponeuroses forming the rectus sheath around the midline.

###Components###
Rectus sheath (anterior and posterior laminae), linea alba, and ventral fascial reinforcements.

##Parts##

###1. Rectus Sheath###
- Envelope formed by aponeuroses of external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus.  
- **Function:** Encases the rectus abdominis and distributes forces across the ventral wall.

###2. Ventral Fascia and Raphe###
- Thickened fascia along the midline and caudoventral abdomen.  
- **Function:** Provides additional tensile strength and anchors for abdominal layers.

###3. Prepubic/Prepelvic Attachments###
- Fascia and tendinous connections to the cranial pelvis.  
- **Function:** Stabilize the ventral wall near the pelvic girdle and support abdominal contents.

##Function##
Reinforce the ventral abdominal floor, protect viscera, and provide a strong insertion platform for lateral layers and the rectus complex, aiding posture and ventilation.

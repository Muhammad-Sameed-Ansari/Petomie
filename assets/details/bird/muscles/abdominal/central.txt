#Abdominal Central Muscles#

The bird’s central abdominal muscles run along the midline, supporting posture and trunk stability.  
They help maintain balance during perching, walking, and flight.  
Energetically, they represent direction, inner alignment, and focused intention.

###Parts###

##Rectus Abdominis##  
A paired muscle running down the midline.  
Energetically, it symbolizes purpose, clarity, and strength in alignment.

##Tendinous Intersections##  
Provide segmented strength and maintain midline integrity.  
Energetically, they reflect structure, rhythm, and steady progression.

##Central Fascia##  
Supports the midline and connects abdominal layers.  
Energetically, it represents unified strength and cohesion.

###Function###  
These muscles maintain core posture, assist with breathing, and stabilize the trunk during flight and perching.  
Energetically, they support balance, centered movement, and focused direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak Core: difficulty maintaining posture.  
Strain: overuse during landing or intense flight.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of direction or weakened inner alignment.

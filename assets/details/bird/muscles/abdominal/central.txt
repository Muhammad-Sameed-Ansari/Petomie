#Abdominal Muscles – Central (Rectus Complex, Avian)#

##Location##
Runs along the ventral midline from the sternum and caudal thorax toward the pubic region, enclosed within the rectus sheath.

###Structure###
A paired longitudinal muscle with tendinous intersections, bound by aponeuroses of the oblique and transverse layers to form the rectus sheath and linea alba.

##Parts##

###1. M. Rectus Abdominis###
- Long, strap‑like muscle on either side of the linea alba.  
- **Function:** Flexes the trunk ventrally, supports viscera, assists expiration, and stabilizes the pelvis during limb movements.

###2. Linea Alba###
- Fibrous midline raphe where abdominal aponeuroses meet.  
- **Function:** Transmits forces between left and right abdominal walls and provides a strong insertion for the sheaths.

###3. Tendinous Intersections###
- Short transverse tendons segmenting the rectus muscle.  
- **Function:** Distribute tension and improve force transmission along the ventral wall.

##Function##
Provide ventral trunk flexion, midline support, and efficient force coupling between lateral abdominal layers for postural control and breathing assistance.

#Ventral Syringeal Muscle#

The ventral syringeal muscle helps control the lower vocal folds of the syrinx.  
It shapes sound amplitude, depth, and resonance by adjusting tissue tension.  
Energetically, it represents grounded communication and emotional depth.

###Parts###

##Ventral Labial Controller##  
Refines lower labial vibration for vocal strength.  
Energetically, it symbolizes depth, connection, and inner resonance.

##Membrane Tension Slips##  
Adjust the tension of the ventral membranes for clarity.  
Energetically, they reflect adaptability and expressive flow.

##Inferior Stabilizing Fibers##  
Maintain steady support during sustained calls.  
Energetically, they represent stability and emotional grounding.

###Function###  
This muscle supports resonance, volume, and tonal depth.  
Energetically, it strengthens authentic, grounded self‑expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Hoarseness: membrane fatigue.  
Weak projection: reduced tension control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty expressing deeper emotions.

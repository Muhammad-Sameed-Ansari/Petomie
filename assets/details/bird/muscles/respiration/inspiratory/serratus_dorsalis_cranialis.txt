##Location##
Dorsolateral thorax, arising from thoracolumbar fascia and inserting on the cranial ribs.

###Shape###
Fan-shaped slips running caudoventrally onto the 1st–several cranial ribs.

- Individual digitations to ribs 1–4 (species variable).  
- **Function:** Elevate cranial ribs for thoracic expansion.

###2. Fascia Origin###

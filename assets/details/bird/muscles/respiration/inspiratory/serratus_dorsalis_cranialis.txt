#Serratus Dorsalis Cranialis#

The serratus dorsalis cranialis lies along the cranial ribs and helps elevate them during inspiration.  
It is important for breathing rhythm and stability of the upper thorax.  
Energetically, it represents uplift, rhythm, and gentle expansion.

###Parts###

##Cranial Rib Slips##  
Attach to upper ribs and lift them during inspiration.  
Energetically, they symbolize rising energy and gentle opening.

##Thoracic Fascia Connections##  
Provide anchorage and distribute movement forces.  
Energetically, they reflect balance and integration.

##Lateral Support Fibers##  
Help maintain rib stability during flight.  
Energetically, they represent steady rhythm and ease.

###Function###  
This muscle assists inhalation, stabilizes the cranial ribs, and supports breathing rhythm.  
Energetically, it uplifts awareness and supports expanded flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted rib lift.  
Weakness: reduced inspiratory support.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty uplifting or expanding.

#Scalenus Muscles#

The bird’s scalenus muscles lie along the cervical-thoracic region and assist with inspiration by helping lift the first ribs.  
They also stabilize the neck and coordinate head–thorax movement.  
Energetically, they represent lift, transition, and clarity.

###Parts###

##Cranial Slips##  
Lift the upper ribs to assist inhalation.  
Energetically, they symbolize rising energy and upward flow.

##Cervical Attachments##  
Connect the muscle to the neck vertebrae for stability.  
Energetically, they reflect alignment and clarity.

##Thoracic Slips##  
Support coordinated movement between neck and ribs.  
Energetically, they represent fluid transition and harmony.

###Function###  
The scalenus muscles support inhalation, stabilize the neck, and guide smooth head–thorax coordination.  
Energetically, they assist lifting, clarity, and transitional movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: breathing strain or neck stiffness.  
Weakness: reduced support for inhalation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty rising or transitioning.

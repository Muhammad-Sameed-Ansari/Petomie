#Scalenus – Avian (Inspiratory)#

##Location##
Runs from the cervical vertebrae to the first ribs and cranial sternum at the thoracic inlet.

###Shape###
Slender, strap-like muscle (often with cranial and caudal portions) spanning neck to cranial ribs.

##Parts##

###1. Cervical Origin###
- Arises from transverse processes of lower cervical vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Provides leverage to lift the first ribs.

###2. First-Rib/Sternal Insertion###
- Attaches to the first ribs and cranial sternum.  
- **Function:** Elevates cranial ribs and assists forward rotation of the sternum.

##Function##
Lifts cranial ribs and facilitates forward/downward excursion of the sternum, aiding inspiratory expansion of the thorax and air sacs.

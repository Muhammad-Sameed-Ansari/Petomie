#External Intercostal – Avian (Inspiratory)#

##Location##
Occupies the outer intercostal spaces between successive ribs of the bird’s thoracic wall.

###Shape###
Thin muscular slips with fibers running caudoventrally from the cranial rib to the next caudal rib.

##Parts##

###1. Intercostal Slip Fibers###
- Span adjacent ribs, fused with external oblique aponeuroses laterally.  
- **Function:** Elevate and rotate ribs laterally during inspiration.

###2. Costochondral Attachments###
- Insert near costochondral junctions and costal cartilages.  
- **Function:** Couple rib motion to sternal excursion for thoracic expansion.

##Function##
Elevate the ribs and assist sternal excursion, expanding the thorax and air sacs during inspiration.

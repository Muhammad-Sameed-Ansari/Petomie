#External Intercostal Muscles#

The bird’s external intercostal muscles lie between the ribs and help expand the ribcage during inspiration.  
They support the lifting of the ribs and assist with airflow through the air sacs.  
Energetically, they represent expansion, openness, and receiving new energy.

###Parts###

##External Fiber Bands##  
Run obliquely between ribs, lifting them during inspiration.  
Energetically, they symbolize opening, rising, and welcoming.

##Costal Attachments##  
Secure the muscle to rib surfaces for coordinated expansion.  
Energetically, they reflect stability and supported growth.

##Thoracic Fascia##  
Connective tissue that distributes inhalation force.  
Energetically, it represents unity and harmonious breath.

###Function###  
These muscles lift the ribs, expand the thorax, and support inhalation.  
Energetically, they enhance openness, receptivity, and upward movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted inhalation.  
Fatigue: excessive breathing effort.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty receiving or expanding.

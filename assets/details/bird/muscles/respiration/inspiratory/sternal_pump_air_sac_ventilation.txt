#Sternal–Rib Pump – Air-Sac Ventilation (Avian Inspiratory Mechanism)#

##Location##
Involves the sternum, coracosternal and costovertebral joints, ribs (including uncinate processes), and associated musculature of the ventral and lateral thorax.

###Structure###
A kinetic linkage where inspiratory muscles elevate/rotate ribs and move the sternum ventrally and cranially, expanding the thoracic cavity and air sacs (birds lack a diaphragm).

##Parts##

###1. Triosseal/Sternal Excursion###
- Sternum moves via coracosternal joints.  
- **Function:** Ventral/cranial excursion increases thoracic volume.

###2. Rib Rotation with Uncinate Processes###
- Ribs rotate laterally; uncinate processes reinforce lever arms.  
- **Function:** Expands thoracic width and supports inspiratory mechanics.

###3. Costovertebral/Costosternal Coupling###
- Joint geometry coordinates bucket‑handle and pump‑handle motions.  
- **Function:** Harmonizes rib and sternal movement to fill air sacs.

##Function##
Provide the primary mechanical expansion for inspiration in birds by coordinated sternal excursion and rib rotation, ventilating anterior and posterior air sacs.

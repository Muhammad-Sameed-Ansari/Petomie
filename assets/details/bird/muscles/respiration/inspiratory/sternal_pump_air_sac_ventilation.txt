#Sternal Pump (Air Sac Ventilation) Muscles#

These muscles assist in moving the sternum during breathing, enabling airflow through the lungs and extensive air sac system.  
They are essential for the unique avian respiratory cycle, coordinating sternum depression and elevation.  
Energetically, they represent breath, rhythm, and the dynamic exchange of energy.

###Parts###

##Sternal Depressor Fibers##  
Draw the sternum downward to expand the air sacs.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding, release, and rhythmic flow.

##Sternal Elevator Fibers##  
Lift the sternum to assist expiration and stabilize movement.  
Energetically, they represent rise, clarity, and renewal.

##Thoracic Support Fascia##  
Coordinates sternum motion with rib and vertebral movement.  
Energetically, it reflects integration, harmony, and balanced exchange.

###Function###  
These muscles coordinate sternum movement, maintain efficient ventilation, and support continuous airflow during flight.  
Energetically, they sustain breath, vitality, and energetic renewal.

###Common Imbalances###  
Fatigue: strenuous flight or rapid breathing.  
Restriction: limited sternum mobility.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty with flow or renewal.

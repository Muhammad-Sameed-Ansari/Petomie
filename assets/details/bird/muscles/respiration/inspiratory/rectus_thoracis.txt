#Rectus Thoracis#

The rectus thoracis is a long, narrow muscle along the thorax that assists with rib stabilization and inspiration.  
It supports controlled rib movement and helps maintain thoracic structure during flight.  
Energetically, it represents alignment, steadiness, and rhythm.

###Parts###

##Thoracic Fibers##  
Run along the ribs to support controlled lifting.  
Energetically, they symbolize direction and structured flow.

##Costal Connections##  
Anchor the muscle to ribs for stability.  
Energetically, they reflect grounding and clarity.

##Lateral Support Slips##  
Assist with fine control of rib motion.  
Energetically, they represent precision and balance.

###Function###  
Rectus thoracis supports rib elevation and thoracic alignment during inspiration.  
Energetically, it maintains steady rhythm and structural clarity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: difficulty with rib motion.  
Weakness: reduced breathing support.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disrupted rhythm or misalignment.

#Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis#

The serratus dorsalis caudalis is a thin muscle along the caudal ribs that helps pull the ribs backward during expiration.  
It plays a key role in respiratory mechanics and trunk stability, especially during flight.  
Energetically, it represents release, grounding, and rhythmic coordination.

###Parts###

##Caudal Rib Slips##  
Muscular bands attaching to the lower ribs to assist expiration.  
Energetically, they symbolize gentle release and downward flow.

##Thoracolumbar Fascia##  
Provides anchorage and distributes movement forces.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and structural harmony.

##Lateral Support Fibers##  
Stabilize the lower ribcage during movement.  
Energetically, they represent balance and supportive flow.

###Function###  
This muscle aids expiration, stabilizes the caudal ribs, and helps maintain breathing rhythm during flight.  
Energetically, it supports grounding, release, and rhythmic alignment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: strain from repetitive breathing demands.  
Weakness: reduced expiratory strength.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty releasing or settling.

#Transversus Thoracis#

The transversus thoracis lies on the inner surface of the sternum and ribs.  
It helps pull the ribs inward during expiration and stabilizes the thoracic cavity.  
Energetically, it represents containment, centeredness, and quiet internal focus.

###Parts###

##Costosternal Fibers##  
Connect ribs to the sternum, aiding rib compression.  
Energetically, they symbolize unity, grounding, and inward support.

##Deep Thoracic Connective Tissue##  
Provides structural continuity for rib movement.  
Energetically, it reflects integration and stability.

##Medial Support Slips##  
Assist in coordinating thoracic pressure changes.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and internal balance.

###Function###  
This muscle contributes to expiration, stabilizes the sternum and ribs, and supports respiratory coordination.  
Energetically, it centers breath, fosters inner calm, and stabilizes the energetic core.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted thoracic motion.  
Weakness: reduced expiratory efficiency.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect inner tension or difficulty centering.

#Abdominal Muscles of Respiration#

The bird’s abdominal respiratory muscles assist ventilation by helping move air through the air sacs and lungs.  
They coordinate with the ribcage and sternum, supporting rhythmic breathing and pressure changes during flight.  
Energetically, they represent flow, rhythm, and the harmony between expansion and release.

###Parts###

##Expiratory Abdominal Fibers##  
Contract to assist expiration and stabilize the lower trunk.  
Energetically, they symbolize release, grounding, and letting go.

##Inspiratory Support Layers##  
Aid subtle expansion of the abdomen to support air sac filling.  
Energetically, they represent openness, receptivity, and inhaled renewal.

##Abdominal Connective Sheath##  
Provides structural continuity for respiratory movement.  
Energetically, it reflects balance, integration, and rhythmic flow.

###Function###  
These muscles assist expiration, stabilize the trunk during breathing, and support airflow during flight.  
Energetically, they help maintain balance between release and expansion.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: shallow breathing or stress.  
Weakness: reduced respiratory efficiency.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty with emotional flow or restricted expression.

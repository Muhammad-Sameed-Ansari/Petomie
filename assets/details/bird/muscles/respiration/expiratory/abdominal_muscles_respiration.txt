#Abdominal Muscles – Respiratory Role (Avian Expiratory)#

##Location##
Lateral and ventral abdominal wall surrounding the coelomic cavity.

###Components###
External oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis acting together as abdominal compressors.

##Parts##

###1. Lateral Abdominal Wall###
- Obliquus externus/internus and transversus form layered sheets.  
- **Function:** Increase intra‑coelomic pressure to expel air from air sacs.

###2. Rectus Complex###
- Rectus abdominis along the midline within the rectus sheath.  
- **Function:** Supports ventral trunk flexion and drives abdominal expiration.

##Function##
Actively compress the coelomic cavity and air sacs to drive expiration, especially during flight, calling, or strenuous activity.

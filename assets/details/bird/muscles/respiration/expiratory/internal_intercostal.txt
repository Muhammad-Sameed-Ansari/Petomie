#Internal Intercostal Muscles#

The bird’s internal intercostal muscles lie between the ribs and help move the ribcage during respiration.  
They assist expiration, stabilize the thorax, and contribute to pressure changes that move air through the air sacs.  
Energetically, they represent structure, rhythm, and the balance of inner movement.

###Parts###

##Intercostal Fiber Bands##  
Run between ribs to assist rib compression.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounded strength and rhythmic support.

##Costal Attachments##  
Anchor the muscles securely to rib surfaces.  
Energetically, they reflect stability and inner foundation.

##Thoracic Fascia##  
Connective tissue that coordinates force across the ribcage.  
Energetically, it represents unity and harmony in motion.

###Function###  
Internal intercostals assist expiration, stabilize the ribcage, and support breathing rhythm during flight and rest.  
Energetically, they sustain internal balance and rhythmic flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: restricted rib motion or shallow breathing.  
Fatigue: overuse during intense flight.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked expression or disrupted rhythm.

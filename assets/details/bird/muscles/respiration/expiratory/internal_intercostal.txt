#Internal Intercostal – Avian (Expiratory)#

##Location##
Deep intercostal layer between ribs on the inner thoracic wall.

###Shape###
Fibers run cranioventrally from the caudal rib toward the next cranial rib, opposite to the external layer.

##Parts##

###1. Intercostal Slip Fibers###
- Span adjacent ribs deep to externals.  
- **Function:** Depress ribs and narrow intercostal spaces during expiration.

###2. Parasternal Portions###
- Near the sternum blend with transversus thoracis.  
- **Function:** Couple rib depression with sternal retraction.

##Function##
Depress ribs and assist sternal retraction, actively compressing the thorax to expel air from the air sacs during expiration.

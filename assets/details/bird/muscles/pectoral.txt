#Pectoral Muscles – Avian#

##Location##
Occupy the ventral thoracic region of the bird, attaching the sternum, keel, and coracoid to the humerus. Form the major flight muscle mass on the chest and ventral wing base.

###Components###
Large, powerful muscles responsible for wing depression, elevation, and stabilization during flight.

##Parts##

###1. M. Pectoralis Major###
- Broad, triangular muscle covering the ventral thorax; originates from the keel and sternum and inserts on the deltopectoral crest of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Produces the powerful downstroke of the wing during flight.

###2. M. Supracoracoideus###
- Lies deep to the pectoralis; originates from the sternum and passes dorsally through the triosseal canal to the humerus.  
- **Function:** Elevates and rotates the wing upward during the upstroke (acts via a pulley mechanism).

###3. M. Subcoracoideus###
- Small muscle beneath the coracoid.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes the shoulder joint during flight and assists in humeral rotation.

###4. M. Sternocoracoideus###
- From sternum to coracoid.  
- **Function:** Draws the coracoid medially, stabilizing the pectoral girdle during wing movement.

###5. M. Coracobrachialis###
- Arises from the coracoid and inserts on the humerus.  
- **Function:** Supports the shoulder joint and limits excessive humeral motion.

##Function##
Generate the primary forces for the wing’s power stroke (downstroke) and recovery stroke (upstroke).  
Provide stabilization of the pectoral girdle and shoulder joint during flight, takeoff, and landing.

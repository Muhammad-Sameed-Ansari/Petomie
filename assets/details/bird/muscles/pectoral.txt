#Pectoral Muscles#

The bird’s pectoral muscles form the powerful chest group responsible for the majority of wing movement.  
They generate the force needed for flight, from strong downstrokes to controlled gliding and flapping adjustments.  
Energetically, they represent strength, momentum, and the courage to rise into new directions.

###Parts###

##Pectoralis Major##  
The largest flight muscle, powering the strong downward wingbeat for lift and propulsion.  
Energetically, it symbolizes drive, forward movement, and powerful expression.

##Pectoralis Minor (Supracoracoideus)##  
Lies beneath the pectoralis major and lifts the wing during the upstroke through a unique tendon-pulley system.  
Energetically, it reflects elevation, lightness, and rising above challenges.

##Sternocoracoideus##  
Supports the sternum and shoulder girdle during flapping and stabilizes the wing joint.  
Energetically, it represents stability, grounding, and centered action.

###Function###  
The pectoral muscles generate lift, enable takeoff, guide wingbeat strength, and stabilize the shoulder girdle.  
Energetically, they support courage, momentum, and the freedom to move upward and forward.

###Common Imbalances###  
Fatigue: repetitive strong wingbeats or long flights.  
Tension: strain from takeoff, landing, or asymmetrical wing use.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect exhaustion, hesitation, or difficulty moving forward.

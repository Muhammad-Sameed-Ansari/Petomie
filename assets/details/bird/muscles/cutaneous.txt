#Cutaneous Muscles – Avian#

##Location##
Situated immediately beneath the skin across limited regions of the bird’s body, primarily over the neck, thorax, and head. These muscles form a thin subcutaneous layer associated with feather tracts and skin movement.

###Shape###
Composed of delicate, flat sheets or small bundles of fibers closely attached to the dermis. They are discontinuous and regionally specialized, lacking the broad continuous panniculus seen in mammals.

##Parts##

###1. M. Cutaneus Colli###
- Lies along the lateral and ventral neck, extending toward the upper breast.  
- **Function:** Moves and tightens skin and feathers around the neck; assists in feather fluffing and protective retraction of the neck.

###2. M. Cutaneus Thoracicus###
- Found over the cranial breast and shoulder region.  
- **Function:** Adjusts skin tension and aids in controlling contour feathers along the chest and wing base.

###3. Facial and Palpebral Muscles###
- Include M. Depressor Palpebrae, M. Levator Palpebrae, and small facial muscles.  
- **Function:** Move eyelids and skin around the eyes; facilitate blinking and feather alignment on the head.

###4. Auricular and Frontal Cutaneous Muscles###
- Surround external ear openings and forehead regions.  
- **Function:** Adjust skin and feathers for auditory focus or visual display (especially in crested or ornamented species).

##Function##
Allow localized skin and feather movement for grooming, thermoregulation, communication, and protection of sensory regions.  
Assist in altering feather position during display or insulation control.  
Contribute to subtle facial and neck expressions unique to avian behavior.

#Rhomboideus Muscle#

The bird’s rhomboideus muscle stabilizes and retracts the scapula, anchoring the wing base to the spine.  
It supports strong wing movements, controlled gliding, and balanced posture.  
Energetically, it represents support, alignment, and the foundation behind purposeful action.

###Parts###

##Cervical Rhomboid Fibers##  
Pull the scapula toward the midline for upper wing stability.  
Energetically, they symbolize clarity and aligned intention.

##Thoracic Rhomboid Fibers##  
Anchor the scapula during powerful wingbeats.  
Energetically, they reflect strength, grounding, and dependable support.

##Scapular Insertion Slips##  
Fine‑tune scapular positioning for smooth wing motion.  
Energetically, they represent precision and harmonious movement.

###Function###  
The rhomboideus retracts and stabilizes the scapula, supporting controlled wing motion and posture.  
Energetically, it reinforces inner alignment and confidence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted scapular motion or stiff wings.  
Weakness: instability at the wing base.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect lack of support or misalignment.

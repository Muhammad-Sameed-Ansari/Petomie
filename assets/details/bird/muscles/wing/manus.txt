#Manus (Hand) Muscles#

The manus muscles control the distal wing segments, including primary feathers essential for steering and speed.  
They manage fine adjustments that allow precision in flight and communication through feather motion.  
Energetically, they represent detail, finesse, and expressive movement.

###Parts###

##Extensor Digitorum Longus##  
Extends the digits and supports feather spread.  
Energetically, it symbolizes outward expression, clarity, and precision.

##Flexor Digitorum Profundus##  
Flexes the digits and supports folding and feather control.  
Energetically, it reflects inward focus, refinement, and subtle shaping.

##Intrinsic Feather Adjusters##  
Tiny muscles that fine-tune primary feather angles.  
Energetically, they represent delicate perception, accuracy, and subtle influence.

###Function###  
Manus muscles guide primary feather control, steering, braking, and fine maneuvering.  
Energetically, they enhance precision, intuitive movement, and detailed expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: reduced steering ability or unstable primaries.  
Tension: stiff digit or feather movement.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty expressing detail or direction.

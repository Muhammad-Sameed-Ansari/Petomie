#Serratus Ventralis#

The serratus ventralis suspends the body between the shoulder girdles and supports scapular movement.  
It helps lift, rotate, and stabilize the shoulder during wing motion.  
Energetically, it represents uplift, support, and balanced connection.

###Parts###

##Cervical Slips##  
Lift and stabilize the scapula during upward motion.  
Energetically, they symbolize elevation and clarity.

##Thoracic Slips##  
Support scapular rotation during wingbeats.  
Energetically, they reflect adaptability and flowing movement.

##Scapular Anchors##  
Hold the scapula securely while allowing controlled movement.  
Energetically, they represent trust, support, and inner steadiness.

###Function###  
This muscle suspends the thorax, stabilizes the scapula, and guides upward and rotational movements.  
Energetically, it provides uplift, support, and rhythmic balance.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: sagging posture or unstable wing base.  
Tension: restricted scapular glide.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect lack of support or difficulty rising.

The bird’s levator scapulae lifts and rotates the scapula, preparing the wing for motion.  
It supports pre‑flight positioning and subtle adjustments during gliding.  
Energetically, it represents readiness, awareness, and elevated perspective.

###Parts###

##Cervical Origin Fibers##  
Lift the scapula to prepare the wing for elevation.  
Energetically, they symbolize alertness and rising intention.

##Scapular Insertion Fibers##  
Control scapular angle for smooth wing engagement.  
Energetically, they reflect precision and refined movement.

##Deep Stabilizing Slips##  
Support the scapula during subtle adjustments.  
Energetically, they represent steadiness and clarity.

###Function###  
Levator scapulae lifts and positions the scapula for efficient wing movement.  
Energetically, it supports readiness, perspective, and awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted wing elevation.  
Weakness: difficulty preparing the wing for lift.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect hesitance or lowered perspective.

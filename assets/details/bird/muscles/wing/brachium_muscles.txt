#Brachium Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **shoulder and elbow**, forming the upper section of the wing.  
These muscles extend along the humerus and control elbow flexion and extension.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, fusiform muscles** with powerful tendons extending toward the elbow joint.  
Well-developed for strength and endurance.

##Parts##

###1. Biceps Brachii###
- Runs along the cranial side of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Flexes the elbow and helps extend the wing during upstroke.

###2. Triceps Brachii###
- Large muscle group along the caudal surface of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Extends the elbow and powers the downstroke during flight.

###3. Brachialis###
- Lies deep to the biceps on the lateral side of the humerus.  
- **Function:** Assists in flexing the elbow joint.

###4. Anconeus###
- Small muscle covering the caudal elbow.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes the elbow during extension.

---

##Function##
- **Extension:** Achieved primarily by the triceps brachii.  
- **Flexion:** Performed by the biceps brachii and brachialis.  
- **Stabilization:** Maintained by the anconeus during wing movement and landing.

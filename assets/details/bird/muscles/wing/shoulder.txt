#Shoulder Muscles#

The bird’s shoulder muscles stabilize and move the wing at its base, allowing powerful lift, rotation, and precise flight control.  
They support the complex mechanics of takeoff, landing, gliding, and maneuvering.  
Energetically, they represent support, direction, and purposeful initiation.

###Parts###

##Scapulohumeralis##  
Rotates and stabilizes the humerus.  
Energetically, it symbolizes orientation, grounding, and aligned action.

##Supracoracoideus##  
Lifts the wing during the upstroke through a tendon pulley.  
Energetically, it represents elevation, freedom, and upward momentum.

##Subcoracoideus##  
Supports shoulder stability and prevents dislocation.  
Energetically, it reflects safety, foundation, and balanced movement.

###Function###  
Shoulder muscles stabilize the wing base, enable rotation, and generate controlled lifting and lowering.  
Energetically, they support purposeful action and confident direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: instability or difficulty lifting the wing.  
Tension: restricted range or stiff rotation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect lack of support or difficulty initiating movement.

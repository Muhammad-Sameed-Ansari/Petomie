#Antebrachium (Forearm) Muscles#

The antebrachium muscles control wrist movement, feather positioning, and fine adjustments during flight.  
They refine aerodynamic shape and help manage speed, gliding, and maneuvering.  
Energetically, they represent refinement, adaptability, and smooth transitions.

###Parts###

##Extensor Carpi Radialis##  
Extends the wrist for spreading the primaries.  
Energetically, it symbolizes openness, elevation, and outward flow.

##Flexor Carpi Ulnaris##  
Flexes the wrist and supports folding of the wing.  
Energetically, it reflects softness, adaptability, and graceful shaping.

##Supinator##  
Rotates the forearm for precise wing adjustments.  
Energetically, it represents alignment, adaptability, and fine control.

###Function###  
Forearm muscles guide wrist motion, feather spread, and aerodynamic shaping.  
Energetically, they support fluid transitions, adaptability, and refined expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Fatigue: prolonged gliding or rapid wingbeats.  
Tension: restricted wrist movement or stiff feather control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty adapting or flowing with change.

#Antebrachium Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **elbow and carpus (wrist)**, forming the middle section of the wing.  
These muscles control **flexion, extension, and stabilization** of the wrist and secondary feathers.

##Shape##
Composed of **elongated, strap-like muscles** arranged into **dorsal (extensor)** and **ventral (flexor)** groups.  
Tendons extend distally to control the fine positioning of feathers and the curvature of the wing.

##Parts##

###Dorsal (Extensor) Group###

###1. Extensor Metacarpi Radialis###
- Positioned along the dorsolateral surface of the forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends and stabilizes the wrist during the downstroke.

###2. Extensor Digitorum Communis###
- Runs along the dorsal surface toward the digits.  
- **Function:** Extends the primary feathers and aids in spreading the wing.

###3. Ulnimetacarpalis Ventralis###
- Extends between the ulna and carpometacarpus.  
- **Function:** Controls wing curvature and assists in flight feather tension.

###4. Supinator###
- Wraps around the proximal radius.  
- **Function:** Rotates the forearm laterally (supination) during maneuvering.

###Ventral (Flexor) Group###

###5. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris###
- Found on the caudal side of the forearm.  
- **Function:** Flexes the wrist and supports folding of the wing.

###6. Flexor Digitorum Profundus###
- Deep, multi-headed muscle connecting to digits.  
- **Function:** Flexes the digits and controls feather grip and folding.

###7. Pronator Teres###
- Small muscle on the medial side of the elbow.  
- **Function:** Rotates the forearm medially (pronation).

###8. Pronator Quadratus###
- Flat muscle between radius and ulna.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes and maintains pronation during wing positioning.

##Function##
- **Extension:** Dorsal muscles control upstroke and wing spread.  
- **Flexion:** Ventral muscles fold the wing during rest and landing.  
- **Rotation:** Supinator and pronators adjust the wing’s orientation.  
- **Stabilization:** Maintains smooth wrist and feather movement during flight.

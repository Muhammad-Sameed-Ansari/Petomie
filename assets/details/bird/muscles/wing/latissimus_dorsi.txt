#Latissimus Dorsi#

The bird’s latissimus dorsi is a broad back muscle that helps retract the wing and stabilize the shoulder girdle.  
It contributes to powerful downstrokes and controlled folding of the wing.  
Energetically, it represents strength, protection, and expansive movement.

###Parts###

##Cranial Band##  
Assists in drawing the wing backward.  
Energetically, it symbolizes direction and powerful intention.

##Caudal Band##  
Supports wing folding and stabilizes the shoulder.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and controlled release.

##Scapular Connection Fibers##  
Coordinate shoulder and wing motion.  
Energetically, they represent unity and smooth flow.

###Function###  
Latissimus dorsi retracts the wing, stabilizes the shoulder, and balances back–wing coordination.  
Energetically, it enhances strength, expansion, and protective presence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: overuse during strong flight or landing.  
Weakness: reduced power in retraction.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty controlling direction or personal space.

#Shoulder Muscles#

##Location##
Located at the **junction of the neck, thorax, and wing**, forming the upper attachment of the forelimb.  
These muscles connect the **scapula, coracoid, and clavicle** to the **humerus**, providing strength and stability for wing movement.

##Shape##
Composed of **broad, triangular, and layered muscles** adapted for the powerful upstroke and downstroke of flight.  
Fibers are short and thick, allowing efficient transfer of force from the body to the wing.

##Parts##

###1. Pectoralis Major###
- Occupies most of the ventral chest region.  
- **Function:** Depresses the wing (downstroke) and generates lift during flight.

###2. Supracoracoideus###
- Lies beneath the pectoralis major, smaller but crucial for flight.  
- **Function:** Elevates the wing during upstroke through a tendon that passes through the triosseal canal to the dorsal side of the humerus.

###3. Deltoideus###
- Covers the shoulder joint laterally.  
- **Function:** Flexes and rotates the wing forward and upward.

###4. Coracobrachialis###
- Found between the coracoid and humerus.  
- **Function:** Adducts and stabilizes the shoulder joint during flight.

###5. Subcoracoideus###
- Deep stabilizing muscle under the coracobrachialis.  
- **Function:** Supports shoulder joint integrity and assists with internal rotation of the wing.

##Function##
- **Upstroke & Downstroke:** Coordinated by supracoracoideus and pectoralis.  
- **Rotation & Flexion:** Controlled by deltoideus and coracobrachialis.  
- **Stabilization:** Maintains shoulder strength and alignment during continuous wing movement.

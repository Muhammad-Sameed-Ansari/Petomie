#Brachium (Upper Wing) Muscles#

The brachium muscles form the upper portion of the wing, powering major wing strokes and guiding strength into flight motion.  
They coordinate the humerus and support the elbow joint.  
Energetically, they represent strength, determination, and directed energy.

###Parts###

##Biceps Brachii##  
Flexes the elbow and stabilizes the wing during motion.  
Energetically, it symbolizes precision, intention, and focus.

##Triceps Brachii##  
Extends the elbow and supports strong outward wing movement.  
Energetically, it reflects expansion, action, and expressive force.

##Coracobrachialis##  
Stabilizes the humerus and supports forward movement.  
Energetically, it represents support, flow, and steady progress.

###Function###  
These muscles power elbow movement, support wing extension, and stabilize the upper wing during flight.  
Energetically, they enhance clarity, strength, and intentional direction.

###Common Imbalances###  
Strain: overuse during strong wingbeats.  
Weakness: reduced control or difficulty extending the wing.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked movement or weakened drive.

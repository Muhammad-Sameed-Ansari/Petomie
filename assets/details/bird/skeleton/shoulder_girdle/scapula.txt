#Scapula#

##Location##
Located along the **dorsal side of the thorax**, nearly parallel to the vertebral column.  
It extends from the **shoulder joint** backward over the ribs, forming part of the **shoulder girdle**.

###Shape###
A **long, narrow, and curved bone** resembling a blade.  
Unlike mammals, the avian scapula is elongated rather than flat, reducing weight and allowing smooth wing movement.

##Parts##

###1. Glenoid Cavity###
- Cup-shaped depression at the anterior end.  
- **Function:** Articulates with the coracoid and humerus, forming the shoulder joint.  

###2. Shaft###
- Long, tapering portion extending posteriorly.  
- **Function:** Provides muscle attachment and stabilizes the shoulder.  

###3. Vertebral Edge###
- Medial border near the ribs.  
- **Function:** Connects to the ribs via muscles and ligaments.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Forms part of the shoulder joint with coracoid and furcula.  
- **Muscle Attachment:** Provides surfaces for shoulder and flight muscles.  
- **Flexibility:** Maintains wing alignment and range of motion during flight.

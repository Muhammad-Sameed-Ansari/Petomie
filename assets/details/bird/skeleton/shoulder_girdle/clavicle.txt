#Clavicle (Part of the Furcula)#

##Location##
Located at the **anterior portion of the thorax**, connecting both **coracoids** and joining medially to form the **furcula (wishbone)**.  
Part of the **shoulder girdle**, linking the wings and sternum.

###Shape###
Paired **slender, curved bones** fused at their lower ends into a **V-shaped structure (furcula)**.  
Highly elastic, acting as a spring during flight.

##Parts##

###1. Lateral Ends###
- Connect to the coracoids near the shoulder joints.  
- **Function:** Stabilize wing articulation.  

###2. Medial Fusion###
- Point where the two clavicles unite (furcula).  
- **Function:** Stores and releases energy during wing movement.  

###3. Hypocleidium###
- Small projection at the fused end.  
- **Function:** Links the furcula to the sternum for added strength.  

##Function##
- **Flight Mechanics:** Serves as a spring that flexes and recoils with each wingbeat.  
- **Stability:** Supports the shoulder joint and connects both wings.  
- **Energy Efficiency:** Enhances aerodynamic motion by absorbing and releasing kinetic energy.

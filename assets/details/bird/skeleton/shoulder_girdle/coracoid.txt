#Coracoid#

##Location##
Situated between the **sternum** and the **shoulder joint**, forming the ventral part of the **shoulder girdle**.  
Connects the **sternum (breastbone)** to the **scapula and humerus**.

###Shape###
A **strong, pillar-like bone** that extends diagonally downward and inward.  
It is thick and sturdy to resist compression during the powerful downstroke of flight.

##Parts##

###1. Sternal End###
- Broad base articulating with the sternum.  
- **Function:** Transmits wing forces to the chest.  

###2. Glenoid End###
- Upper end joining the scapula and humerus.  
- **Function:** Contributes to the shoulder joint and wing articulation.  

###3. Foramen Triosseum###
- Opening formed where coracoid, scapula, and clavicle meet.  
- **Function:** Passage for the **supracoracoideus tendon**, enabling wing elevation during flight.  

##Function##
- **Flight Support:** Acts as a brace between the shoulder and sternum.  
- **Force Transmission:** Absorbs and transfers pressure from wingbeats.  
- **Protection:** Prevents thoracic collapse during flight.

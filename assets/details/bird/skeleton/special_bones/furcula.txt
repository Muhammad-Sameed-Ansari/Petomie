#Furcula (Wishbone)#

##Location##
Located at the **front of the thorax**, between the two **coracoids** and above the **sternum**.  
It connects to the **shoulder girdle** and forms part of the **avian flight apparatus**.

###Shape###
A **V-shaped bone** formed by the fusion of the two clavicles.  
Elastic and spring-like, allowing movement and recoil during wingbeats.

##Parts##

###1. Clavicular Branches###
- The two arms forming the “V.”  
- **Function:** Connect the coracoids and transmit forces between the wings.  

###2. Interclavicular Angle###
- Point where the two arms meet ventrally.  
- **Function:** Absorbs and releases energy during flight strokes.  

###3. Hypocleidium###
- Small median projection on the ventral end.  
- **Function:** Connects to the sternum and strengthens the pectoral connection.  

##Function##
- **Flight Mechanics:** Acts as a spring to store and release energy during wingbeats.  
- **Support:** Strengthens the shoulder girdle.  
- **Protection:** Shields thoracic structures from excessive wing force.

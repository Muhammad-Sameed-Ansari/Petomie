#Uncinate Processes#

##Location##
Project **backward from the ribs** along the thoracic cage.  
Present on most ribs except the first and last few.

###Shape###
Small, **hook-like projections** extending caudally from the rib shafts.  
Composed of compact bone and integrated into the rib structure.

##Parts##

###1. Rib Projection###
- Bony extension from the rib’s middle section.  
- **Function:** Overlaps the next rib to reinforce the ribcage.  

###2. Junction Point###
- Area where the uncinate process fuses with the rib.  
- **Function:** Strengthens costal articulation.  

##Function##
- **Respiratory Support:** Maintains thoracic rigidity during breathing.  
- **Muscle Attachment:** Provides anchor points for respiratory muscles.  
- **Flight Stability:** Prevents ribcage collapse during strong wing strokes.

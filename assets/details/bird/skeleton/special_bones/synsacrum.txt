#Synsacrum#

##Location##
Located in the **posterior trunk region**, forming a rigid connection between the **vertebral column** and the **pelvis**.  
Extends from the **thoracic region** to the **caudal vertebrae**.

###Shape###
A **fused structure** of multiple vertebrae — typically the last thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and some caudal segments — combined with the pelvic bones.  
Creates a stiff, lightweight platform for flight and bipedal support.

##Parts##

###1. Fused Vertebrae###
- Combination of thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and anterior caudal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Provides rigidity and reduces motion between trunk and pelvis.  

###2. Iliac Fusion###
- Lateral fusion with the ilium of the pelvis.  
- **Function:** Transmits leg forces directly to the axial skeleton.  

###3. Neural Spines###
- Dorsal ridges along the vertebral fusion.  
- **Function:** Reinforce structural stability.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Provides a strong base for walking, perching, and flight takeoff.  
- **Protection:** Shields pelvic nerves and internal organs.  
- **Efficiency:** Reduces energy loss by minimizing body flexion during motion.

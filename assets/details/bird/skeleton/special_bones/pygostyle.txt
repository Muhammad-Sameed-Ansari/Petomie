#Pygostyle#

##Location##
At the **posterior end of the vertebral column**, following the **synsacrum**.  
Formed by the fusion of the last few **caudal vertebrae**.

###Shape###
A short, **triangular or flattened bone** tapering toward the tail tip.  
Supports the **rectrices (tail feathers)** through attached muscles and connective tissue.

##Parts##

###1. Fused Caudal Vertebrae###
- Usually 4–7 vertebrae fused into one unit.  
- **Function:** Provides a stable anchor for tail movement.  

###2. Rectricial Bulb###
- Muscle complex attached to the pygostyle.  
- **Function:** Controls tail feather spread and position.  

##Function##
- **Flight Control:** Directs airflow and balance during flight.  
- **Communication:** Assists in visual tail displays.  
- **Stability:** Aids in braking and steering during landing.

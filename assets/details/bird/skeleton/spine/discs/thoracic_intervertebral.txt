#Thoracic Intervertebral Discs#

##Location##
Between thoracic vertebrae before partial fusion into the notarium (T2–T5/6 depending on species).

###Shape###
Small discs early in life; adults develop partial or full fusion forming the rigid notarium.

###Parts###

##Annulus Fibrosus##
Thin fibrocartilage ring stabilizing the joint while allowing mobility.
Energetically represents boundaries, support, and clarity.

##Nucleus Pulposus##
Soft central cushioning core enabling smooth articulation.
Energetically reflects adaptability, fluid motion, and emotional balance.

##Individual Discs##
###T1–T2 Disc###
Supports rib and wing base stability before fusion. Energetically reflects strength and structural support.

###T2–T3 Disc###
Supports rib and wing base stability before fusion. Energetically reflects strength and structural support.

###T3–T4 Disc###
Supports rib and wing base stability before fusion. Energetically reflects strength and structural support.

###T4–T5 Disc###
Supports rib and wing base stability before fusion. Energetically reflects strength and structural support.

###T5–T6 Disc###
Supports rib and wing base stability before fusion. Energetically reflects strength and structural support.


###Function###
Provide early-life cushioning; in adults, fused thoracic vertebrae support flight forces and wing loading.

#Thoracic Vertebrae#

##Location##
Situated between the **cervical** and **synsacral regions**, forming the **upper back**.  
They articulate with the ribs and support the **thoracic cage**.

###Shape###
Short, strong vertebrae often **partially fused** in the middle section for rigidity.  
Bear **facets** for rib articulation and processes for muscle attachment.

##Parts##
- **Articular Facets:** Connect with ribs.  
- **Spinous Processes:** Project dorsally for ligament and muscle attachment.  
- **Fused Segments:** Central thoracics fused for strength.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Form the framework for the ribcage.  
- **Protection:** Enclose and safeguard the thoracic organs.  
- **Stability:** Fused areas increase strength for wing movement.

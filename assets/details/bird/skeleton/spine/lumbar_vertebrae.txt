#Lumbar Vertebrae#

##Location##
Found between the **thoracic vertebrae** and the **sacral region**.  
In birds, these are **fused with sacral and some thoracic vertebrae** to form the **synsacrum**.

###Shape###
Flattened and fused bones with **broad transverse processes** that unite with the pelvis.  
This fusion provides rigidity to support flight and bipedal posture.

##Parts##
- **Fused Lumbar Elements:** Combine with sacral bones.  
- **Transverse Processes:** Extend laterally to join with the pelvis.  
- **Neural Canal:** Protects the spinal cord through the fused area.

##Function##
- **Rigidity:** Stabilizes the trunk during flight.  
- **Support:** Transfers forces between the spine and hindlimbs.  
- **Protection:** Shields the spinal cord and internal organs.

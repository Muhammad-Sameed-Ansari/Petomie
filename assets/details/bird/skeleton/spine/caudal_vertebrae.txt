#Caudal Vertebrae#

##Location##
Located at the **posterior end of the vertebral column**, behind the synsacrum.  
They lead to the **pygostyle**, which supports the tail feathers.

###Shape###
Short, tapering vertebrae that gradually decrease in size toward the tail.  
The last few fuse to form the pygostyle.

##Parts##
- **Proximal Caudals:** Allow limited tail movement.  
- **Distal Caudals:** Smaller and more rigid.  
- **Pygostyle (Fused Tip):** Supports tail feathers (rectrices).

##Function##
- **Balance:** Aids in flight maneuvering and stability.  
- **Communication:** Controls tail movements for display.  
- **Flight Control:** Adjusts airflow during braking and steering.

#Cervical Vertebrae#

##Location##
Form the **neck region**, between the **skull** and the **thoracic vertebrae**.  
Birds have between **10 and 25 cervical vertebrae**, depending on species, allowing extraordinary neck flexibility.

###Shape###
Elongated and **saddle-shaped (heterocoelous)** vertebrae that interlock to allow wide movement while preventing dislocation.  
Each vertebra is **light, hollow, and slightly curved** for balance and mobility.

##Parts##
- **Atlas (1st cervical):** Supports the skull and allows nodding.  
- **Axis (2nd cervical):** Enables rotation of the head.  
- **Middle Cervicals:** Provide bending and twisting.  
- **Posterior Cervicals:** Broader, linking to the thoracic region.

##Function##
- **Flexibility:** Provides the bird with extreme neck mobility for preening, feeding, and balance.  
- **Protection:** Encloses the spinal cord while maintaining lightness.  
- **Balance:** Adjusts head position for flight and landing control.

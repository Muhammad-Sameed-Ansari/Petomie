#Hyoid Apparatus#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral side of the skull**, extending from the **base of the tongue** backward along the **floor of the oropharynx** and into the **neck region**.  
The hyoid apparatus supports the **tongue and larynx**, and its elongated structure varies among species depending on feeding behavior.

###Shape###
Composed of **slender, paired rods and central elements** that may be elongated or curved.  
In some birds (e.g., woodpeckers), the hyoid extends far behind the skull for specialized tongue projection.

##Parts##

###1. Basihyal###
- Central anchor bone at the base of the tongue.  
- **Function:** Provides attachment for tongue muscles.  

###2. Ceratobranchials###
- Paired rods extending laterally from the basihyal.  
- **Function:** Support the sides of the tongue and laryngeal structure.  

###3. Epibranchials###
- Continue from the ceratobranchials posteriorly.  
- **Function:** Extend beneath or around the skull, aiding in tongue retraction.  

###4. Urohyal###
- Median posterior element connected to the trachea.  
- **Function:** Assists in larynx movement and swallowing.  

##Function##
- **Tongue Support:** Provides a firm base for tongue muscles.  
- **Feeding Adaptation:** Enables specialized tongue extension and retraction.  
- **Respiratory Assistance:** Coordinates tongue and larynx movement during breathing and vocalization.

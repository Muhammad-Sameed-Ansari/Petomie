Thin, paired bones that are often elongated and curved.  
They may be partially fused or separated by openings for air passages.

##Parts##

###1. Nasofrontal Suture###
- Junction with the frontal bones.  
- **Function:** Supports the beak and nasal cavity roof.  

###2. Nasal Aperture###
- Space between nasal bones.  
- **Function:** Passage for air and olfactory structures.  

###3. Maxillary Connection###
- Articulates laterally with the maxilla.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes upper beak structure.  

##Function##
- **Respiration:** Forms part of the nasal air passage.  
- **Protection:** Shields the nasal cavity.  
- **Support:** Reinforces the upper beak.

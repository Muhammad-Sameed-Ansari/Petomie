#Lacrimal Bone#

##Location##
Located at the **front of the orbit**, between the **nasal** and **frontal bones**, and above the **jugal arch**.  
Forms part of the eye socket and nasal boundary.

###Shape###
Small, delicate, often **L-shaped bone** that may bear a process extending toward the beak.  
Highly variable among species.

##Parts##

###1. Orbital Process###
- Projects into the eye socket.  
- **Function:** Forms part of the orbital wall.  

###2. Nasal Process###
- Extends toward the nasal bone.  
- **Function:** Separates the orbit from the nasal cavity.  

###3. Zygomatic Articulation###
- Connects with the jugal (zygomatic) bone.  
- **Function:** Strengthens facial framework.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Forms part of the orbit and nasal wall.  
- **Protection:** Shields the eye and lacrimal duct.  
- **Connection:** Links nasal and orbital regions structurally.

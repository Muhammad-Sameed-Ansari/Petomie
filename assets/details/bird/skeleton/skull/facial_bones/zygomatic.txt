#Zygomatic Bone (Jugal Bone)#

##Location##
Forms part of the **lateral face**, connecting the **quadrate** with the **maxilla** and **lacrimal bones**.  
Also called the **jugal bone** in birds.

###Shape###
Slender, rod-like **arched bone** extending along the side of the skull.  
Provides flexibility for cranial kinesis (movement of the upper beak).

##Parts##

###1. Anterior Process###
- Connects to the maxilla.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes the facial skeleton.  

###2. Posterior Process###
- Attaches to the quadrate.  
- **Function:** Transmits motion between the upper and lower jaw.  

###3. Lacrimal Connection###
- Joins the lacrimal bone near the orbit.  
- **Function:** Strengthens orbital structure.  

##Function##
- **Cranial Kinesis:** Transfers movement during beak elevation.  
- **Support:** Provides lateral reinforcement of the face.  
- **Protection:** Shields the orbit and underlying tissues.

#Mandible (Lower Beak)#

##Location##
Forms the **lower portion of the beak**, articulating with the **quadrate bone** on each side of the skull.  
Extends from the **beak tip** to the **jaw joint** beneath the cranium.

###Shape###
A **V-shaped bone** made of fused left and right halves (rami).  
Lightweight and rigid, often pneumatic, covered by a keratin sheath (rhamphotheca).

##Parts##

###1. Dentary###
- Main anterior part of each ramus.  
- **Function:** Supports the keratin beak and provides strength for pecking or grasping.  

###2. Articular###
- Posterior end of each ramus forming the jaw joint.  
- **Function:** Articulates with the quadrate bone for jaw movement.  

###3. Angular & Surangular###
- Small supporting bones fused along the lower border.  
- **Function:** Reinforce the mandible and distribute biting forces.  

###4. Mandibular Symphysis###
- Median fusion point where the two rami meet.  
- **Function:** Provides stability and structural rigidity.  

##Function##
- **Feeding Mechanics:** Opens and closes the beak for grasping, crushing, or filtering.  
- **Communication:** Assists in vocalization and sound resonance.  
- **Protection:** Shields underlying tongue and soft tissues.

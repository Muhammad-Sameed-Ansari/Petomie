#Auditory Ossicles#

##Location##
Located within the **middle ear cavity**, between the **tympanic membrane (eardrum)** and the **inner ear (cochlea)**.  
Birds possess a single ossicle called the **columella (stapes)**, which transmits sound vibrations.

###Shape###
A **slender, rod-like bone** with expanded ends — one attached to the eardrum and the other to the oval window of the inner ear.  
Surrounded by a small air-filled chamber continuous with the pneumatic system of the skull.

##Parts##

###1. Columella (Stapes)###
- Only auditory ossicle in birds.  
- **Function:** Conducts vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear fluid.  

###2. Extracolumella###
- Cartilaginous extension at the outer end of the columella.  
- **Function:** Connects the ossicle to the eardrum for effective sound transmission.  

###3. Footplate###
- Flattened inner end of the columella fitting into the oval window.  
- **Function:** Transmits mechanical energy to the cochlear fluids.  

##Function##
- **Sound Transmission:** Transfers and amplifies sound vibrations to the inner ear.  
- **Protection:** Dampens excessive vibrations to protect the sensory cells.  
- **Balance Integration:** Works with the inner ear to coordinate auditory and equilibrium functions.

###Shape###
Irregular and compact bone that includes **otic and squamous parts** housing the ear structures.  
Varies in shape depending on species’ auditory adaptations.

##Parts##

###1. Squamosal Region###
- Thin upper portion near the parietal bone.  
- **Function:** Contributes to the side wall of the cranium.  

###2. Otic Capsule###
- Encloses the structures of the inner ear.  
- **Function:** Protects the vestibular and auditory organs.  

###3. Quadrate Articulation###
- Site where the **quadrate bone** attaches.  
- **Function:** Enables beak and jaw movement.  

##Function##
- **Auditory Protection:** Encloses the ear and hearing mechanisms.  
- **Articulation:** Forms joint surfaces for the quadrate and jaw.  
- **Support:** Contributes to skull stability.

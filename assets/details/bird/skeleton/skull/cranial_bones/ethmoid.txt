#Ethmoid Bone#

##Location##
Located between the **orbits**, forming part of the **nasal cavity** and **anterior cranial base**.  
Connects the **nasal septum** to the frontal and sphenoid bones.

###Shape###
Light, spongy bone with multiple **air spaces**.  
Often reduced or fused with surrounding bones in birds for cranial lightness.

##Parts##

###1. Nasal Septum###
- Median plate formed partly by the ethmoid.  
- **Function:** Separates nasal chambers.  

###2. Turbinal Bones###
- Delicate scroll-like projections within the nasal cavity.  
- **Function:** Warm and filter inhaled air.  

###3. Cribriform Plate###
- Perforated region allowing passage of olfactory nerves.  
- **Function:** Transmits smell signals to the brain.  

##Function##
- **Respiration:** Supports nasal airflow and olfaction.  
- **Protection:** Separates brain from nasal cavity.  
- **Lightness:** Reduces skull weight while maintaining strength.

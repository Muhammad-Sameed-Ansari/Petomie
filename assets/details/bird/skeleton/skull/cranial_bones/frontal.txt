#Frontal Bone#

##Location##
Forms the **dorsal and anterior part of the cranium**, lying between the **orbits** and extending toward the **nasal bones**.  
Contributes to the **roof of the skull** and supports the **upper surface of the brain**.

###Shape###
Paired or fused **flat bones** that are slightly convex and elongated.  
In many birds, the frontals extend into the **supraorbital region**, forming part of the eye socket.

##Parts##

###1. Supraorbital Area###
- Upper margin of the orbit.  
- **Function:** Protects the eye and provides attachment for periocular tissues.  

###2. Nasofrontal Junction###
- Anterior end articulating with the nasal bones.  
- **Function:** Forms part of the beak base and nasal opening.  

###3. Parietofrontal Suture###
- Posterior border joining the parietal bones.  
- **Function:** Maintains cranial integrity.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Shields the brain and sensory organs.  
- **Support:** Provides structure for orbital and nasal regions.  
- **Attachment:** Serves as a site for facial muscle and membrane attachment.

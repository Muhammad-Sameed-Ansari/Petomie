#Sphenoid Bone#

##Location##
Located at the **base of the skull**, between the **frontal, temporal, and occipital bones**.  
Forms part of the cranial floor and supports the braincase.

###Shape###
A **complex, unpaired bone** consisting of multiple fused elements (presphenoid, basisphenoid).  
Contains **openings for optic and cranial nerves**.

##Parts##

###1. Presphenoid###
- Anterior portion near the orbits.  
- **Function:** Forms part of the eye socket and cranial floor.  

###2. Basisphenoid###
- Posterior part articulating with the occipital bone.  
- **Function:** Strengthens the skull base and transmits cranial nerves.  

###3. Sphenoid Sinuses###
- Air-filled spaces (if present) within the bone.  
- **Function:** Lighten the skull and improve resonance.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Forms a central base for cranial structure.  
- **Protection:** Shields cranial nerves and vessels.  
- **Balance:** Connects anterior and posterior skull bones.

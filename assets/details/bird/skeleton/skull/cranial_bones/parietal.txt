#Parietal Bone#

##Location##
Located on the **posterior roof of the cranium**, between the **frontal and occipital bones**.  
Forms the upper back portion of the skull protecting the cerebrum and cerebellum.

###Shape###
Broad, thin **paired plates** forming the dorsal aspect of the cranial vault.  
In many birds, these bones fuse along the midline.

##Parts##

###1. Parietal Crest###
- Raised ridge along the midline.  
- **Function:** Strengthens the skull and provides attachment for neck muscles.  

###2. Lateral Borders###
- Articulate with the **squamosal and frontal bones**.  
- **Function:** Maintain cranial stability.  

###3. Posterior Margin###
- Joins the occipital region.  
- **Function:** Protects the hindbrain and visual centers.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Encloses the brain’s dorsal surface.  
- **Attachment:** Supports neck and cranial muscles.  
- **Structure:** Maintains shape and rigidity of the skull roof.

#Femur#

##Location##
Located in the **thigh region** of the bird’s hindlimb, between the **pelvis** and the **tibiotarsus**.  
It articulates proximally with the **acetabulum** of the pelvis and distally with the **tibiotarsus** and **fibula**.

###Shape###
A **short, robust, and slightly curved bone**, positioned more horizontally than in most mammals.  
Contains **pneumatic openings** connected to air sacs, reducing weight while maintaining strength.

##Parts##

###1. Head###
- Rounded proximal end articulating with the acetabulum.  
- **Function:** Enables rotation and flexion of the leg.  

###2. Shaft###
- Strong and slightly curved.  
- **Function:** Supports muscle attachment and transfers forces during walking and landing.  

###3. Distal End###
- Contains condyles for articulation with the tibiotarsus and fibula.  
- **Function:** Forms the knee joint and transmits locomotor forces.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Bears the weight of the body during stance and motion.  
- **Locomotion:** Provides leverage for walking, running, and perching.  
- **Respiratory Integration:** Pneumatic openings connect to air sacs, aiding in body-lightening and thermoregulation.

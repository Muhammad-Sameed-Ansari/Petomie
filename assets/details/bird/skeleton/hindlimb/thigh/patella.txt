#Patella#

##Location##
Located at the **front of the knee joint**, embedded within the **tendon of the quadriceps femoris**.  
It lies between the **distal femur** and **proximal tibiotarsus**, forming part of the extensor mechanism of the leg.

###Shape###
A **small, flat, and elongated sesamoid bone**, varying in size among bird species.  
In strong-running or large birds (e.g., ostriches, chickens), it is more distinct and ossified, while in smaller birds it may be partially cartilaginous.

##Parts##

###1. Tendinous Connection###
- Embedded within the tendon of the quadriceps femoris.  
- **Function:** Transmits muscle force from the thigh to the leg.  

###2. Articular Surface###
- Smooth posterior side that glides over the femoral trochlea.  
- **Function:** Reduces friction at the knee joint.  

##Function##
- **Leverage:** Increases the mechanical advantage of the quadriceps tendon during leg extension.  
- **Protection:** Shields the knee joint and underlying tendon from stress.  
- **Stability:** Guides tendon motion and maintains alignment through flexion and extension.

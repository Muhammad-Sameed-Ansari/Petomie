#Central Tarsal – Avian Status#

##Location##
In mammals (e.g., cats), a **central tarsal** may be distinct.  
In birds, **no separate central tarsal** exists in adults — it is **incorporated into the fused complexes** of the ankle region.

###Shape###
The would-be central element is **integrated** within:  
- The **tibiotarsus** (proximal complex), or  
- The **tarsometatarsus** (distal complex), depending on species-specific development.

##Parts##
- Not identifiable as a discrete bone in adult birds.  
- Considered a **developmental component** of the fused tarsal mass.

##Function##
- **Structural Integration:** Contributes to joint surfaces and rigidity through fusion.  
- **Adaptation:** Eliminating separate central elements reduces weight and simplifies the ankle for efficient locomotion.

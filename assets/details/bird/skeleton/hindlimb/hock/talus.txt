#Talus (Astragalus) – Avian Equivalent#

##Location##
In birds, the **talus (astragalus)** is not a separate bone.  
It is **fused to the proximal tibia** early in development to form the **tibiotarsus** (upper ankle/leg bone).  
Functionally contributes to the **knee-to-hock linkage**, with the ankle joint occurring between the **tibiotarsus (proximal)** and **tarsometatarsus (distal)**.

###Shape###
Exists as part of the **proximal tarsal complex** incorporated into the tibiotarsus.  
Appears as **articular surfaces and ridges** rather than a free-standing bone.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal Tarsal Ossification###
- Fused into the tibial epiphysis.  
- **Function:** Forms part of the smooth joint surfaces for flexion/extension.

###2. Tibial Condyles & Crests (Related Structures)###
- Adjacent bony features of the tibiotarsus.  
- **Function:** Provide attachment for ligaments and guide ankle motion.

##Function##
- **Joint Formation:** Contributes to the proximal side of the **intertarsal (hock) joint**.  
- **Stability:** Fusion reduces bone count while maintaining strength for perching and landing.  
- **Efficiency:** Lightens the limb, an adaptation for flight.

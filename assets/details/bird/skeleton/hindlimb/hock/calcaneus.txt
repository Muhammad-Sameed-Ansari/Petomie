#Calcaneus – Avian Equivalent#

##Location##
The **calcaneus** in birds is also **not a separate bone**.  
It is **fused with the tibia** as part of the **proximal tarsals**, forming the **tibiotarsus**.  
Birds **lack a calcaneal tuber (heel)** like mammals.

###Shape###
Represented by **fused tarsal components** within the proximal end of the tibiotarsus.  
No prominent heel; surfaces are streamlined for lightweight function.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal Tarsal Elements###
- Incorporated into the tibiotarsus.  
- **Function:** Reinforce the upper ankle region.

###2. Lateral Support Region###
- Area analogous to the mammalian calcaneal side.  
- **Function:** Provides leverage for tendons and stabilizes the hock.

##Function##
- **Support:** Strengthens the ankle while minimizing mass.  
- **Force Transmission:** Helps route tendons and share load during push-off and landing.  
- **Adaptation:** Fusion improves rigidity for efficient bipedal stance and flight.

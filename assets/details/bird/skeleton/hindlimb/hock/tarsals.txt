#Tarsals – Avian Overview#

##Location##
The **tarsal bones** of birds are divided developmentally into **proximal** and **distal** sets, but in adults they are **fused** into two major bones:  
- **Proximal tarsals → TIBIOTARSUS** (fused with tibia; upper ankle)  
- **Distal tarsals → TARSOMETATARSUS** (fused with metatarsals; lower ankle/foot)

###Shape###
Instead of multiple small bones, birds have **two elongated fused elements** forming the intertarsal (hock) joint.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal Complex (Tibiotarsus)###
- Fusion of tibia + proximal tarsals.  
- **Function:** Forms the **upper** articular surface of the ankle.

###2. Distal Complex (Tarsometatarsus)###
- Fusion of distal tarsals + metatarsals.  
- **Function:** Forms the **lower** articular surface and supports the toes.

##Function##
- **Lightweight Strength:** Fewer bones reduce mass without sacrificing stability.  
- **Locomotion:** Creates a strong, spring-like **hock joint** for perching, walking, and landing.  
- **Efficiency:** Streamlined design supports flight-related energy savings.

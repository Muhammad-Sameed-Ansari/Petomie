#Tibiotarsus#

##Location##
Located in the **lower leg** of the bird, between the **femur** (above) and the **tarsometatarsus** (below).  
It forms the **main weight-bearing bone** of the hindlimb and connects the knee joint to the hock joint.

###Shape###
A **long, strong, and slightly curved bone** formed by the fusion of the **tibia** and **proximal tarsal bones**.  
This fusion makes the bone lightweight yet durable, ideal for supporting perching, walking, or landing.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal End###
- Articulates with the femur at the knee joint.  
- **Function:** Supports flexion and extension at the knee.  

###2. Shaft###
- Long and cylindrical with a nutrient foramen for blood supply.  
- **Function:** Provides attachment for leg muscles and tendons.  

###3. Distal End###
- Expanded area that connects to the tarsometatarsus.  
- **Function:** Forms the upper part of the hock joint, allowing smooth movement.  

###4. Cnemial Crests###
- Bony ridges near the proximal end.  
- **Function:** Anchor points for strong extensor muscles of the leg.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Primary bone for weight-bearing and leg stability.  
- **Locomotion:** Facilitates walking, running, and landing by transmitting muscle forces.  
- **Adaptation:** Fused design enhances strength without increasing mass, crucial for flight.

#Fibula#

##Location##
The bird’s fibula lies alongside the tibiotarsus in the lower leg.  
Unlike mammals, it is reduced in length and does not reach the ankle joint.  
It runs down the lateral side of the leg, providing structural support.

A thin, slender bone that tapers toward the lower limb.  
Its shortened form allows greater flexibility and reduces weight for flight.

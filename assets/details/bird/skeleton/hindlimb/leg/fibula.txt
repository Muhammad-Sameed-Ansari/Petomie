#Fibula#

##Location##
Located on the **lateral side of the tibiotarsus**, running parallel to it in the lower leg.  
Extends from the **femur** down toward the **hock joint**, but does **not reach the ankle** in most birds.

###Shape###
A **slender, tapering bone**, long proximally and reduced distally.  
It fuses partially with the tibiotarsus near its lower end, making it lighter than in mammals.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal End###
- Articulates with the lateral condyle of the femur.  
- **Function:** Contributes to knee stability.  

###2. Shaft###
- Long and thin, narrowing as it descends.  
- **Function:** Provides attachment points for muscles.  

###3. Distal End###
- Usually reduced and fused with the tibiotarsus.  
- **Function:** Enhances rigidity and reduces weight.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Stabilizes and guides leg movement alongside the tibiotarsus.  
- **Lightweight Adaptation:** Reduced size minimizes weight without losing strength.  
- **Muscle Attachment:** Serves as a slender anchor for lower leg muscles.

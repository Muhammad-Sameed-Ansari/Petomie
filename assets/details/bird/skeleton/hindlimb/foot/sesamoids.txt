#Sesamoid Bones#

##Location##
Small bones embedded within **tendons and ligaments** of the **joints**, especially in the **legs and feet**.  
Commonly found near the **ankle** and **toe joints**.

###Shape###
Tiny, rounded or flattened bones that form within tendons where friction or stress occurs.  
Composed of dense compact bone for strength.

##Parts##

###1. Metatarsal Sesamoids###
- Located at the metatarsophalangeal joints.  
- **Function:** Protect tendons and improve leverage.  

###2. Tarsal Sesamoids###
- Found near the ankle (tarsal) joints.  
- **Function:** Reduce friction and stabilize tendons.  

###3. Digital Sesamoids###
- Present at the toe joints.  
- **Function:** Facilitate smooth flexion and extension of the digits.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Prevent tendon wear and damage.  
- **Efficiency:** Improve mechanical advantage of tendons.  
- **Stability:** Reinforce joint strength during walking, grasping, or landing.

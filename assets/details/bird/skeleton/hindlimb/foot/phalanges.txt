#Phalanges#

##Location##
The phalanges are the small bones forming the toes of the bird.  
They lie at the end of the foot, connecting to the distal metatarsal region.

###Shape###
Short, lightweight bones arranged in segments.  
Their number and length vary depending on species and function — grasping, perching, digging, climbing, or swimming.

The first bones attached to the metatarsus.  
Energetically, symbolize initiation and connection.

##Middle Phalanges##
Intermediate segments that add length and flexibility.  
Energetically, represent movement and fluidity.

##Distal Phalanges##
The final bones at the tip of each toe, often supporting claws.  
Energetically, embody precision, grip, and purposeful action.

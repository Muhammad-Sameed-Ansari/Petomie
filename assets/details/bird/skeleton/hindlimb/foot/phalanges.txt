#Phalanges (Toe Bones)#

##Location##
Form the **distal part of the hindlimb**, extending from the **tarsometatarsus** to the **claws or nails**.  
They compose the **toes (digits)** used for perching, walking, or grasping.

###Shape###
Small, jointed bones forming a series of segments within each digit.  
The number and length of phalanges vary depending on the bird’s lifestyle (perching, raptorial, aquatic, etc.).

##Parts##

###1. Proximal Phalanges###
- Articulate with the tarsometatarsus.  
- **Function:** Provide strength for toe flexion.  

###2. Middle Phalanges###
- Intermediate bones between proximal and distal segments.  
- **Function:** Add flexibility and range of motion.  

###3. Distal Phalanges###
- Terminal bones supporting the claws or talons.  
- **Function:** Allow grasping, perching, or catching prey.  

##Function##
- **Locomotion:** Enable walking, perching, or grasping.  
- **Balance:** Maintain stability during movement or rest.  
- **Adaptation:** Shape and number vary according to species’ habits (e.g., raptors vs. perching birds).

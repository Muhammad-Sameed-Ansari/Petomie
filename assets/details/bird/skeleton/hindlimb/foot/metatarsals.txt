#Metatarsals (Tarsometatarsus)#

##Location##
Located in the **lower leg (hindlimb)** between the **distal tarsals** and the **phalanges (toes)**.  
In birds, the metatarsals are **fused with the distal tarsal bones** to form the **tarsometatarsus**.

###Shape###
A **single elongated bone** formed by the fusion of three metatarsals.  
The central shaft is strong yet lightweight, providing leverage for walking, perching, or landing.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal End###
- Articulates with the distal tarsals of the tibiotarsus.  
- **Function:** Forms the ankle joint and transmits leg forces to the foot.  

###2. Shaft###
- Long and narrow with small foramina (openings).  
- **Function:** Provides rigidity and attachment for tendons.  

###3. Distal End###
- Divides into three trochleae (condyles) for the digits.  
- **Function:** Allows controlled toe movement for perching and grasping.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Acts as the central bone of the lower limb.  
- **Locomotion:** Transmits forces from the leg to the toes during walking or landing.  
- **Adaptation:** Provides strength and elasticity suited to perching, running, or swimming species.

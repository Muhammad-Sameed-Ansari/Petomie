#Pelvis#

##Location##
Located in the **posterior trunk region**, forming the connection between the **vertebral column (synsacrum)** and the **hindlimbs**.  
It extends along the lower back and supports the legs, tail, and internal organs.

###Shape###
A **large, fused, and elongated structure** composed of the **ilium, ischium, and pubis**, united with the **synsacrum**.  
Open ventrally (no pelvic floor), allowing space for the passage of large eggs in females.  
Unlike mammals, the pelvic girdle of birds is **rigid but lightweight**, supporting upright posture and flight stability.

##Parts##

###1. Ilium###
- The broad, dorsal bone fused to the synsacrum.  
- **Function:** Transfers the forces from the hindlimbs to the spine and supports the abdominal organs.

###2. Ischium###
- The posterior bone extending beneath the ilium.  
- **Function:** Forms the rear section of the pelvis and provides attachment points for leg muscles.

###3. Pubis###
- A long, thin bone running parallel to the ischium.  
- **Function:** Supports the abdominal wall and creates the open ventral pelvic region for egg passage.

###4. Synsacral Fusion###
- Fusion of lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae with the pelvis.  
- **Function:** Provides rigidity and stability for perching, landing, and locomotion.

##Function##
- **Support:** Anchors the hindlimbs and supports internal organs.  
- **Reproduction:** Open pelvic design allows egg passage.  
- **Stability:** Fusion with the synsacrum provides strong yet lightweight support for flight and walking.  
- **Force Transmission:** Transfers leg motion forces efficiently to the trunk.

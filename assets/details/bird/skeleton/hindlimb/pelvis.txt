#Pelvis#

##Location##
The bird’s pelvis forms the strong, fused structure at the base of the spine, connecting the hind limbs to the trunk.  
It lies between the lumbar region and the tail, designed to support upright posture, perching, walking, and the forces of landing and takeoff.

###Shape###
A long, lightweight yet sturdy structure made of fused bones (synsacrum and pelvic girdle).  
Its open, elongated form accommodates internal organs and allows flexibility during movement and flight.

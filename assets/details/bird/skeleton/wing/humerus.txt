#Humerus#

##Location##
Located in the **brachium (upper arm)**, between the **shoulder girdle (scapula and coracoid)** and the **forearm (radius and ulna)**.  
It connects the **body to the wing** and serves as a major attachment point for the powerful flight muscles.

###Shape###
A **short, thick, and slightly curved bone** with expanded ends for articulation.  
The humerus is often **pneumatic**, containing air sacs that connect with the respiratory system to reduce weight.

##Parts##

###1. Head###
- Rounded proximal end articulating with the scapula’s glenoid cavity.  
- **Function:** Enables wing rotation and flexion at the shoulder joint.  

###2. Shaft###
- Slightly curved and hollow with pneumatic openings.  
- **Function:** Reduces bone weight while maintaining strength.  

###3. Deltopectoral Crest###
- Prominent ridge near the proximal end.  
- **Function:** Major attachment site for **pectoralis and supracoracoideus** flight muscles.  

###4. Distal End###
- Articulates with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.  
- **Function:** Transmits muscle forces to the forearm during wing movement.  

##Function##
- **Flight Power:** Anchors major flight muscles for wing elevation and depression.  
- **Flexibility:** Forms part of the shoulder and elbow joints for smooth motion.  
- **Respiratory Adaptation:** Houses air sacs for lighter bone structure and improved flight efficiency.

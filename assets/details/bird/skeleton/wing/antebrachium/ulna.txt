#Ulna#

##Location##
The ulna is the larger of the two bones in the bird’s antebrachium, lying on the caudal (rear) side of the wing.  
It runs parallel to the radius and supports many of the secondary flight feathers.

###Shape###
A long, slightly curved bone thicker than the radius, designed for strength and feather attachment.

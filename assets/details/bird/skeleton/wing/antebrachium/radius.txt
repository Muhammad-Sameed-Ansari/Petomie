#Radius#

##Location##
The radius is one of the two long bones of the bird’s antebrachium (forearm), located on the cranial side of the wing.  
It runs parallel to the ulna and connects the elbow joint to the wrist, contributing to wing stability and precise movement.

###Shape###
A slender, straight bone that is lighter and narrower than the ulna, adapted for aerodynamic efficiency and refined control.

###Parts###

##Proximal End##
Connects with the humerus at the elbow joint.  
Energetically, symbolizes initiation, direction, and supported beginnings.

##Shaft##
The long, narrow midsection allowing flexibility and lightweight structure.  
Energetically, represents flow, precision, and intentional movement.

##Distal End##
Connects to the carpal bones at the wrist.  
Energetically, embodies transition, coordination, and refined action.

###Function###
Stabilizes the wing during flight and assists with fine adjustments in wing shape.  
Works with the ulna to support feathers and maintain aerodynamic balance.  
Energetically, governs precision, fluid coordination, and controlled motion.

###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Solar Plexus Chakra  
Meridian: Pericardium Meridian  
Emotional Meaning: Precision, control, and purposeful direction  
Balanced Energy: Smooth, coordinated, confident movement

###Common Imbalances###
Strain from repetitive wing motion, bruising, or flight impact.  
Energetically, difficulty controlling direction or maintaining balance.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###
Colors: Yellow and light gold encourage clarity and coordination.  
Crystals: Citrine and yellow fluorite enhance focus and control.  
Element: Air promotes freedom and flow.  
Affirmation: “My movements are precise, balanced, and aligned.”

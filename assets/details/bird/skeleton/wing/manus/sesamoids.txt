#Sesamoid Bones#

##Location##
Small bones embedded within **tendons and joints** of the **wing and leg**.  
Most prominent near the **carpus** and **digits**, especially where tendons change direction.

###Shape###
Tiny, rounded or oval bones formed within tendons.  
Composed of compact bone with smooth articular surfaces.

##Parts##

###1. Carpal Sesamoids###
- Found near the wrist joint.  
- **Function:** Protect tendons and reduce friction during wing movement.  

###2. Digital Sesamoids###
- Located near the phalangeal joints.  
- **Function:** Enhance tendon leverage and reduce wear.  

###3. Patagial Sesamoids###
- Occasionally present in the **patagium (wing membrane)**.  
- **Function:** Maintain tension and smooth movement of the flight membrane.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Prevent tendon damage during repeated motion.  
- **Efficiency:** Improve muscle-tendon mechanics and reduce friction.  
- **Stability:** Reinforce joint strength during flight strokes.

#Metacarpals#

##Location##
The bird’s metacarpals are located in the wing, forming part of the manus (hand) region.  
Most species have fused metacarpals that create a lightweight yet strong structure for flight feather attachment.

###Shape###
Slender, elongated bones that may be partially or fully fused depending on species.  
Their structure maximizes strength while minimizing weight.

###Parts###

##Major Metacarpal##
The larger fused segment anchoring primary flight feathers.  
Energetically, symbolizes strength, direction, and propulsion.

##Minor Metacarpal##
The smaller segment assisting with control and feather support.  
Energetically, represents precision, balance, and subtle guidance.

##Fusion Region##
The area where carpals and metacarpals merge.  
Energetically, embodies unity, cooperation, and integrated movement.

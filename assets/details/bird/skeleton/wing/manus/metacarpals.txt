#Metacarpals (Carpometacarpus)#

##Location##
Located within the **manus (hand) region** of the wing, between the **carpus** and the **phalanges**.  
Formed by the **fusion of the metacarpal bones** with some carpal elements to create the **carpometacarpus**.

###Shape###
A single, elongated **fused bone** with projections and grooves for feather attachment.  
Lightweight yet strong, allowing flexibility and support for flight feathers.

##Parts##

###1. Major Metacarpal###
- The largest shaft on the posterior side.  
- **Function:** Supports primary feathers and articulates with the digits.  

###2. Minor Metacarpal###
- Thinner, medial portion of the carpometacarpus.  
- **Function:** Provides stability and attachment for muscles and tendons.  

###3. Alular (First Digit) Metacarpal###
- Short projection at the proximal end.  
- **Function:** Supports the alula (small thumb-like structure aiding flight control).  

##Function##
- **Support:** Acts as the structural base for the wing tip and primary feathers.  
- **Flight Mechanics:** Enables wing flexibility and maneuverability.  
- **Strength:** Combines rigidity and lightness through bone fusion.

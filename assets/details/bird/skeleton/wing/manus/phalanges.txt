#Phalanges (Wing Digits)#

##Location##
Form the **distal section of the wing**, attached to the **metacarpals** of the carpometacarpus.  
Correspond to the **digits (fingers)** in other animals, though highly reduced in birds.

###Shape###
Small, jointed bones arranged into **three primary digits** (I, II, and III).  
Lightweight and partly fused for stability during flight.

##Parts##

###1. Digit I (Alular Digit)###
- Shortest digit, supports the **alula**.  
- **Function:** Provides fine control during low-speed flight and landing.  

###2. Digit II (Major Digit)###
- Central and largest digit.  
- **Function:** Anchors the **primary flight feathers** and supports wing extension.  

###3. Digit III (Minor Digit)###
- Small and partially fused to the carpometacarpus.  
- **Function:** Adds stability to the wing tip.  

##Function##
- **Flight Control:** Fine-tunes feather positioning for lift and steering.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows limited motion for aerodynamic adjustments.  
- **Support:** Strengthens wing edges and feather alignment.

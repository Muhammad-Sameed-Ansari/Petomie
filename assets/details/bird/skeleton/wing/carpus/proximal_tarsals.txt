#Proximal Tarsals#

##Location##
Located in the **ankle region** of the bird’s **hindlimb**, between the **tibia** and **distal tarsals/metatarsals**.  
In birds, these bones are **fused with the tibia** to form the **tibiotarsus**.

###Shape###
Compact and irregular bones that become integrated into the shaft of the tibiotarsus.  
They contribute to a strong yet lightweight limb adapted for walking, perching, or landing.

##Parts##

###1. Astragalus###
- Medial proximal tarsal bone fused with the tibia.  
- **Function:** Forms part of the ankle joint and allows flexion and extension.  

###2. Calcaneus###
- Lateral proximal tarsal bone.  
- **Function:** Provides leverage for tendons and stabilizes the joint.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Strengthens the connection between the leg and foot.  
- **Movement:** Permits controlled flexion and extension during locomotion.  
- **Fusion Adaptation:** Reduces bone count for efficiency and stability.

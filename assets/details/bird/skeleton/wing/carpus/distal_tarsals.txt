#Distal Tarsals#

##Location##
Situated between the **proximal tarsals** (part of the tibiotarsus) and the **metatarsals** of the foot.  
In birds, these bones are **fused with the metatarsals** to form the **tarsometatarsus**.

###Shape###
Small, flattened bones that fuse early in development, creating a single elongated structure.  
Provide articulation for the digits and attachment for tendons.

##Parts##

###1. Distal Tarsal I–IV###
- Represent the distal series, fused to the metatarsals.  
- **Function:** Support digit alignment and strength.  

###2. Hypotarsus###
- Ridge on the proximal end of the tarsometatarsus.  
- **Function:** Guides flexor tendons to the toes.  

##Function##
- **Integration:** Combines stability and lightness through fusion.  
- **Support:** Provides the base for toe articulation.  
- **Locomotion:** Aids efficient energy transfer during walking or perching.

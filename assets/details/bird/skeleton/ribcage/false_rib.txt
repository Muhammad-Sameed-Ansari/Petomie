#False Ribs#

##Location##
Situated **caudal to the true ribs**, attaching dorsally to the **thoracic vertebrae** but not directly to the sternum.  
They may connect indirectly via cartilage or remain free ventrally.

###Shape###
Shorter and slightly flatter than true ribs, often fused or reduced in size.  
Still retain **uncinate processes** in most birds for additional support.

##Parts##

###1. Vertebral Connection###
- Joins the thoracic vertebrae dorsally.  
- **Function:** Provides partial mobility and stability.  

###2. Costal Cartilage###
- May connect indirectly to the sternum or adjacent ribs.  
- **Function:** Allows flexibility during wing motion and breathing.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Extends the protective framework of the thorax.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows thoracic expansion during respiration.  
- **Reinforcement:** Maintains strength in the posterior ribcage.

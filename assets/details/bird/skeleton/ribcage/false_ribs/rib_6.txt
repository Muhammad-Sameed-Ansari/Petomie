#Rib 6#

##Location##
Rib 6 is one of the false ribs in birds.
These ribs connect indirectly through cartilage and neighboring ribs. They provide flexibility to the thoracic cage, allowing movement needed for breathing and flight control.
Each rib also bears an uncinate process, a bony projection that overlaps the next rib, giving the bird’s chest extra strength during flight.

###Shape###
Curved, slender bones with lateral uncinate processes for reinforcement and stability.

###Function###
Protect the lungs and air sacs, assist in the bird’s breathing system, and stabilize the thorax during flight.
Energetically, they represent strength, rhythm, and the balance between movement and stability.

#Costal Cartilage#

##Location##
The costal cartilage in birds connects the ventral ends of the ribs to the sternum, also known as the keel.
These cartilages form the flexible joints that allow controlled movement of the ribcage during breathing and flight.

###Shape###
Short, slightly curved cartilage segments that provide both strength and limited elasticity.
They are firmer than in mammals, designed to support the bird’s rigid yet dynamic thoracic structure.

###Function###
Provides structural stability and limited flexibility for the thoracic cage, enabling the expansion and contraction required for the bird’s air-sac breathing system.
Energetically, represents flexibility within structure and the balance of stability and motion.

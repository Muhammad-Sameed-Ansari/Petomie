#Rib 1#

##Location##
Rib 1 is one of the true ribs in birds.
These ribs attach directly to the sternum, forming the sturdy front section of the ribcage. They support strong flight muscles and stabilize the chest during wing motion.
Each rib also bears an uncinate process, a bony projection that overlaps the next rib, giving the bird’s chest extra strength during flight.

###Shape###
Curved, slender bones with lateral uncinate processes for reinforcement and stability.

###Function###
Protect the lungs and air sacs, assist in the bird’s breathing system, and stabilize the thorax during flight.
Energetically, they represent strength, rhythm, and the balance between movement and stability.

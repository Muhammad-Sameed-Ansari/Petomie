#True Ribs#

##Location##
Located on the **thoracic region** of the bird’s trunk, attached dorsally to the **thoracic vertebrae** and ventrally to the **sternum** via **costal cartilages**.  
These ribs form the **main ribcage** that protects vital organs.

###Shape###
Curved, elongated bones with **articular heads** and **uncinate processes** — bony projections unique to birds.  
They overlap adjacent ribs, strengthening the ribcage for respiration and flight stability.

##Parts##

###1. Vertebral Segment###
- Dorsal part connected to the vertebra.  
- **Function:** Provides articulation and flexibility during breathing.  

###2. Sternal Segment###
- Ventral portion connecting to the sternum via cartilage.  
- **Function:** Transmits movement during respiration.  

###3. Uncinate Process###
- Lateral projection extending caudally over the next rib.  
- **Function:** Reinforces the ribcage and aids in muscle attachment.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Shields the heart and lungs.  
- **Support:** Maintains thoracic shape and rigidity during flight.  
- **Respiration:** Assists in air sac compression and lung ventilation.

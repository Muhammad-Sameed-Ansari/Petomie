#Sternum (Keel / Carina)#

##Location##
Forms the **ventral midline bone** of the thorax, articulating with the **true ribs** and **coracoids**.  
The sternum supports the **pectoral girdle** and the powerful **flight muscles**.

###Shape###
A broad, flat bone with a prominent **ventral keel (carina)** projecting downward.  
Highly specialized and variable among flying, swimming, and flightless birds.

##Parts##

###1. Keel (Carina)###
- Large vertical ridge along the midline.  
- **Function:** Major attachment site for the pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles used in flight.  

###2. Body (Corpus Sterni)###
- Central portion connecting ribs.  
- **Function:** Supports thoracic cavity and anchors muscles.  

###3. Costal Facets###
- Lateral articulations for ribs.  
- **Function:** Strengthen rib attachment and breathing mechanics.  

###4. Coracoid Facets###
- Dorsal articulations for the coracoid bones.  
- **Function:** Transmit wing forces to the sternum during flight.  

###5. Xiphoid Process###
- Posterior projection (sternal spine).  
- **Function:** Provides balance and protection for abdominal organs.  

##Function##
- **Flight Mechanics:** Serves as a base for powerful wing muscles.  
- **Support:** Provides structural rigidity to the chest.  
- **Protection:** Shields the heart, lungs, and air sacs.

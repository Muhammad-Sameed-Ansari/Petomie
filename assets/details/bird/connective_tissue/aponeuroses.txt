#Aponeuroses#

In birds, aponeuroses are broad, flat sheets of dense connective tissue that anchor flight and body muscles to bone.  
They distribute force efficiently while keeping the body lightweight for flight.  
Energetically, they represent **focus, strength distribution, and coordinated power**.

###Parts###

##Thoracic and Pectoral Aponeuroses##  
Support major flight muscles of the chest and wings.  
Energetically, they symbolize **power in expression and freedom**.

##Abdominal Aponeuroses##  
Stabilize the trunk and support breathing and posture.  
Energetically, they reflect **core stability and inner support**.

##Cervical Aponeuroses##  
Assist neck muscles in precise head and beak movements.  
Energetically, they embody **clarity, awareness, and direction**.

###Function###  
Aponeuroses spread muscular force over a wide area, support flight mechanics, and maintain posture with minimal weight.  
Energetically, they help **organize strength, intention, and graceful action**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension: over-effort or pressure to perform.  
Weakness: reduced support or scattered energy.  
Restrictions: limited wing or neck movement, blocked expression.

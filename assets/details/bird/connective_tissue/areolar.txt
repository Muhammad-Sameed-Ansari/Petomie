#Areolar (Loose) Connective Tissue#

##Location##
Widespread beneath **epithelial layers**, around **vessels, nerves, and organs**, and between **muscles and skin**.  
Forms the **soft packing material** throughout the body.

###Shape###
Loosely organized mesh of **collagen, elastin, and reticular fibers** with abundant **ground substance**.  
Contains **fibroblasts**, **macrophages**, and **mast cells** in a fluid matrix.

##Parts##

###1. Fibroblasts###
- Main cells producing fibers and matrix.  
- **Function:** Maintain structure and healing.

###2. Elastic & Collagen Fibers###
- Interwoven strands providing flexibility and tensile strength.  
- **Function:** Allow tissue stretch and recoil.

###3. Ground Substance###
- Gel-like matrix between fibers.  
- **Function:** Supports and nourishes surrounding cells.

##Function##
- **Support:** Cushions and connects tissues.  
- **Flexibility:** Allows movement of vessels and organs.  
- **Defense:** Site for immune cells and inflammation.  
- **Diffusion:** Permits exchange of gases and nutrients.

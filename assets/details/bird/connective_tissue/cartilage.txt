#Cartilage#

##Location##
Found at **articular surfaces of joints**, in the **tracheal rings**, **syrinx**, and at **developing bone ends** in young birds.  
Also present at sites requiring **flexible support** such as the **sternal keel–rib interfaces**.

###Shape###
Semi-rigid, **smooth and resilient** connective tissue lacking blood vessels.  
Types include **hyaline (joint surfaces, trachea)** and **elastic (syrinx, ear region)**.

##Parts##

###1. Articular (Hyaline) Cartilage###
- Covers **humerus, radius/ulna, femur, tibia** joint surfaces.  
- **Function:** Reduces friction and absorbs shock during movement.

###2. Tracheal Cartilage Rings###
- C-shaped rings along the **trachea**.  
- **Function:** Keep the airway open while allowing neck movement.

###3. Syringeal (Elastic) Cartilage###
- Plates within the **syrinx** at the tracheobronchial junction.  
- **Function:** Provides flexibility for **vocalization**.

###4. Costosternal Cartilage###
- Between **ribs and sternum/keel**.  
- **Function:** Allows rib excursion during breathing.

##Function##
- **Cushioning:** Protects bones from impact and wear.  
- **Flexibility:** Maintains open passages and movable joints.  
- **Growth Support:** Serves as a template at developing bone ends in juveniles.  
- **Sound Modulation:** Enables shape change of the syrinx for calls and song.

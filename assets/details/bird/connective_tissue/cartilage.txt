#Cartilage#

In birds, cartilage provides structural flexibility to the skeleton, especially in the sternum, beak, and airways.  
It allows for lightness and shock absorption during flight.  
Energetically, it represents **flexibility, grace, and adaptation**.

###Parts###

##Hyaline Cartilage##  
Covers joint surfaces and supports smooth movement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **flow and freedom**.

##Elastic Cartilage##  
Shapes the beak and syrinx, allowing vocalization and flexibility.  
Energetically, it reflects **expression and adaptability**.

##Fibrocartilage##  
Provides strong support in wing joints and between vertebrae.  
Energetically, it represents **stability and endurance**.

###Function###  
Cartilage maintains flexibility, supports flight mechanics, and absorbs impact.  
Energetically, it sustains **ease of movement and adaptability in life**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Rigidity: fear or resistance to change.  
Softening: lack of direction or weakness.  
Damage: energetic imbalance between control and surrender.

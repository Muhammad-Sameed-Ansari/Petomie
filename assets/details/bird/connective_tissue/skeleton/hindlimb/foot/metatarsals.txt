#Metatarsals#

##Location##
The bird’s metatarsals form the long lower section of the leg between the ankle joint and the toes.  
In most birds, these bones are fused into a single structure called the tarsometatarsus, giving strength and lightness for perching, walking, and landing.

###Shape###
An elongated, lightweight bone formed by the fusion of several metatarsals.  
Its structure varies across species, adapting to perching, running, climbing, or swimming.

###Parts###

The upper surface connecting to the tibiotarsus.  
Energetically, reflects stability and upward support.

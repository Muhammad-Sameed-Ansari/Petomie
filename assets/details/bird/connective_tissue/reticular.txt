#Reticular Connective Tissue#

##Location##
Forms the **framework (stroma)** of **lymphoid organs** such as the **spleen, thymus, and Bursa of Fabricius**, as well as **bone marrow** and parts of the **liver**.

###Shape###
Composed of **fine, branching reticular fibers** made of **type III collagen**, forming a supportive network that holds cells in place.

##Parts##

###1. Reticular Fibers###
- Fine collagen strands forming a delicate mesh.  
- **Function:** Provides internal scaffolding for organs.

###2. Reticular Cells###
- Specialized fibroblasts maintaining reticular fibers.  
- **Function:** Support and regulate tissue structure.

###3. Lymphoid Cells###
- Lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages residing within the mesh.  
- **Function:** Immune defense and filtration.  

##Function##
- **Structural Support:** Maintains organ integrity and shape.  
- **Cell Anchorage:** Provides a network for immune and blood cells.  
- **Filtration:** Retains debris and microorganisms for immune removal.

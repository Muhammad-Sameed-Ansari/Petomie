#Reticular Connective Tissue#

In birds, reticular connective tissue forms delicate networks that support lymphoid organs, bone marrow, and filtering tissues.  
It provides a framework where immune and blood cells can develop and interact.  
Energetically, it represents **subtle structure, inner protection, and community**.

###Parts###

##Reticular Fiber Network##  
Fine branching fibers create supportive meshes.  
Energetically, they symbolize **interconnection and inner order**.

##Lymphoid Support##  
Lines spleen, bursa, and lymphoid tissue to host immune cells.  
Energetically, it reflects **defense, wisdom, and discernment**.

##Marrow and Hematopoietic Framework##  
Supports blood cell formation.  
Energetically, it embodies **renewal and deep vitality**.

###Function###  
Reticular tissue gently holds sensitive cells in place, enabling filtration, immunity, and regeneration.  
Energetically, it maintains **inner safety, coherence, and quiet strength**.

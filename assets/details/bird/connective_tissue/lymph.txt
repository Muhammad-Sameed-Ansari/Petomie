#Lymph#

##Location##
A **clear fluid** within **lymphatic capillaries and vessels** throughout the body.  
Major avian lymphoid organs include the **spleen**, **thymus**, and the **Bursa of Fabricius** (unique to birds).  
Note: Most birds **lack true lymph nodes**; immune tissue is mainly **diffuse or nodular**.

###Shape###
Watery connective tissue with **lymphocytes**, few proteins, and cellular debris; flows in **thin-walled vessels** with valves.

##Parts##

###1. Lymphatic Vessels & Capillaries###
- Network draining **interstitial fluid** back to the blood.  
- **Function:** Returns fluid, transports immune cells, and removes waste.

###2. Spleen###
- Small organ near the **stomach**.  
- **Function:** Filters blood, recycles cells, and mounts immune responses.

###3. Thymus###
- Paired lobes along the **neck** in juveniles.  
- **Function:** Matures **T-lymphocytes**.

###4. Bursa of Fabricius###
- Dorsal to the **cloaca** in young birds.  
- **Function:** Site of **B-lymphocyte** development; regresses with age.

##Function##
- **Fluid Balance:** Returns tissue fluid to circulation.  
- **Immunity:** Produces, houses, and transports lymphocytes.  
- **Defense:** Removes pathogens and supports antibody production.

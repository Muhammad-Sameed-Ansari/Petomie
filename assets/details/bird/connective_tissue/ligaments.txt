#Ligaments#

In birds, ligaments connect bones and support joint stability, especially in wings and legs.  
They prevent overextension while allowing controlled flexibility.  
Energetically, they represent **support, stability, and trust in movement**.

###Parts###

##Wing Ligaments##  
Stabilize flight joints and assist in wing folding.  
Energetically, they symbolize **balance and trust in freedom**.

##Leg Ligaments##  
Maintain posture and strength for landing and perching.  
Energetically, they reflect **grounding and confidence**.

##Spinal Ligaments##  
Support the neck and back during flight and movement.  
Energetically, they embody **strength and centeredness**.

###Function###  
Ligaments stabilize joints, prevent injuries, and guide movement.  
Energetically, they maintain **balance between flexibility and security**.

###Common Imbalances###  
- Overstretching: lack of boundaries.

#Ligaments#

##Location##
Present throughout the **joints of the wings, legs, spine, and tail**, connecting **bone to bone**.  
Key sites include the **shoulder (triosseal region)**, **elbow and wrist**, **intervertebral joints**, and **pelvic–tail junction**.

###Shape###
Composed of **dense regular connective tissue** with parallel collagen fibers.  
Appear as **cord-like bands or flat sheets** that resist stretching while guiding joint motion.

##Parts##

###1. Propatagial Ligament###
- Runs along the **leading edge of the wing** within the patagium.  
- **Function:** Maintains wing shape and limits excessive extension at the shoulder and wrist.

###2. Glenohumeral (Shoulder) Ligaments###
- Surround the **scapulocoracoid–humerus joint**.  
- **Function:** Stabilize the shoulder during powerful flapping.

###3. Ulnocarpal & Radiocarpal Ligaments###
- Bind the **ulna/radius to the carpal bones**.  
- **Function:** Stabilize the wrist during wing folding and extension.

###4. Interspinous & Supraspinous Ligaments###
- Connect **adjacent vertebral spines** along the back.  
- **Function:** Prevent excessive flexion and maintain posture.

###5. Sacrocaudal Ligaments###
- Link the **pelvis** with the **first tail vertebrae/pygostyle**.  
- **Function:** Support tail positioning and feather control.

##Function##
- **Stability:** Hold bones in alignment under high flight loads.  
- **Guidance:** Direct safe joint ranges during flapping and landing.  
- **Energy Efficiency:** Store and release elastic energy to reduce muscle effort.  
- **Protection:** Resist dislocation and hyperextension.

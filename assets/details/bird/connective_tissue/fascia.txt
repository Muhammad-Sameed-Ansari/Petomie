#Fascia#

##Location##
Widespread **connective tissue sheaths and membranes** enveloping muscles, vessels, nerves, and organs.  
Includes **superficial fascia** under the skin and **deep fascia** separating muscle groups.

###Shape###
Sheets of **collagen and elastin** forming **gliding layers**.  
Ranges from thin, pliable membranes to dense aponeurotic sheets.

##Parts##

###1. Superficial Fascia###
- Lies beneath the **skin** with variable fat content.  
- **Function:** Allows skin mobility, stores fat, and supports vessels.

###2. Deep Fascia###
- Surrounds and partitions **muscle groups** (e.g., pectoral and wing compartments).  
- **Function:** Transmits force, reduces friction, and guides muscle action.

###3. Aponeuroses###
- Broad, flattened tendinous sheets (e.g., over **pectoral region**).  
- **Function:** Distribute muscle forces across wide areas.

###4. Retinacula###
- Thickened fascia at the **carpus and tarsus**.  
- **Function:** Stabilize tendons during rapid movement.

##Function##
- **Support:** Suspends and organizes tissues.  
- **Glide:** Provides low-friction planes for movement.  
- **Force Transmission:** Links muscles into functional chains.  
- **Protection:** Encloses neurovascular bundles and muscles.

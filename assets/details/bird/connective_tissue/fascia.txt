#Fascia#

In birds, fascia is a continuous web of connective tissue enveloping muscles, bones, and organs.  
It integrates movement and helps transmit energy across the body during flight.  
Energetically, it represents **unity, communication, and fluid motion**.

Lies beneath the skin, connecting feathers and muscles.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **sensitivity and flow of awareness**.

##Deep Fascia##  
Surrounds muscles, supporting coordination and flight stability.  
Energetically, it reflects **alignment and direction**.

##Visceral Fascia##  
Anchors organs and supports internal motion.

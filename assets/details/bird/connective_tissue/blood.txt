#Blood#

In birds, blood carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones through a high-efficiency circulatory system adapted for flight.  
It supports thermoregulation and rapid metabolism.  
Energetically, it represents **life force, freedom, and flow**.

###Parts###

##Red Blood Cells##  
Oval and nucleated, they transport oxygen efficiently during flight.  
Energetically, they symbolize **energy and endurance**.

##White Blood Cells##  
Defend against infections and stress.  
Energetically, they reflect **protection and purification**.

##Platelets (Thrombocytes)##  
Play a role in clotting and tissue repair.  
Energetically, they represent **healing and recovery**.

##Plasma##  
Transports nutrients and hormones.  
Energetically, it embodies **movement and vitality**.

###Function###  
Blood maintains oxygen flow, nutrient delivery, and heat distribution during flight and rest.  
Energetically, it sustains **balance, rhythm, and emotional harmony**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Anemia: depletion or low vitality.  
Clotting issues: energy stagnation.  
Infection: stress or energetic overload.

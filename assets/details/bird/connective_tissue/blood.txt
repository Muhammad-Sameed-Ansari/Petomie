#Blood#

##Location##
Circulates within the **cardiovascular system**: heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins.  
Perfuses **all tissues**, delivering gases and nutrients.

###Shape###
A fluid connective tissue composed of **plasma** and **formed elements**.  
Avian **red blood cells are oval and nucleated**; leukocytes include heterophils (granulocytes), lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils.

##Parts##

###1. Plasma###
- Liquid component carrying **water, proteins, electrolytes, and hormones**.  
- **Function:** Solvent and transport medium.

###2. Erythrocytes (RBCs)###
- Nucleated, oval cells.  
- **Function:** Transport **oxygen and carbon dioxide**.

###3. Leukocytes (WBCs)###
- Heterophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils.  
- **Function:** Immune defense and inflammation control.

###4. Thrombocytes###
- Nucleated platelet-like cells.  
- **Function:** **Clotting** and vessel repair.

##Function##
- **Transport:** Gases, nutrients, wastes, and hormones.  
- **Regulation:** pH, temperature, and fluid balance.  
- **Protection:** Clotting and immune surveillance.

#Elastic Connective Tissue#

##Location##
Found in **ligamentous sheets**, **arterial walls**, **trachea**, **bronchi**, and **specialized wing ligaments** requiring high elasticity.  
Particularly prominent in the **propatagial ligament** of the wing and **cervical region**.

###Shape###
Dense connective tissue with **parallel or branching elastic fibers** interwoven with collagen.  
Yellowish and resilient in appearance.

##Parts##

###1. Elastic Fibers###
- Composed of elastin and fibrillin.  
- **Function:** Allow stretch and recoil of tissues.

###2. Fibroblasts###
- Scattered between fibers.  
- **Function:** Synthesize and maintain matrix components.

###3. Collagen Support Fibers###
- Provide tensile strength and limit overextension.  
- **Function:** Prevent tearing during stretch.

##Function##
- **Elasticity:** Enables expansion and recoil (e.g., during flight or breathing).  
- **Resilience:** Maintains tension while permitting flexibility.  
- **Support:** Reinforces tissues exposed to mechanical stress.

#Elastic Connective Tissue#

In birds, elastic connective tissue is rich in elastic fibers, allowing tissues to stretch and recoil.  
It is crucial in arteries, air sacs, and certain ligaments involved in flight and breathing.  
Energetically, it represents **resilience, rhythm, and flexible strength**.

###Parts###

##Elastic Arterial Walls##  
Allow major arteries to expand and recoil with each heartbeat.  
Energetically, they symbolize **steady flow and adaptability**.

##Elastic Ligaments##  
Support wing and neck movements with spring-like recoil.  
Energetically, they reflect **dynamic freedom and readiness**.

##Elastic Fibers in Respiratory Structures##  
Assist air sac and bronchial movement.  
Energetically, they embody **ease of breath and life force**.

###Function###  
Elastic connective tissue maintains continuous motion with minimal effort, supporting flight, circulation, and breathing.  
Energetically, it preserves **bounce-back ability, balance, and rhythmic flow**.

###Common Imbalances###  
- Loss of elasticity: rigidity, fatigue, or burnout.  
- Overstretching: instability or overextension.  
- Tension: difficulty relaxing or trusting the flow.

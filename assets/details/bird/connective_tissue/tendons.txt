#Tendons#

##Location##
Attach **muscle to bone** across the body, especially prominent in the **wing (wrist/hand)** and **hindlimb**.  
Many avian tendons are **long and cord-like**, running through sheaths and pulleys.

###Shape###
Dense regular connective tissue with **parallel collagen fibers**; may show **tendon ossification** in legs of some species for added stiffness.

##Parts##

###1. Extensor/Flexor Carpi Tendons###
- Cross the **carpus** to control **wrist** movement.  
- **Function:** Extend/flex the wing during flight and folding.

###2. Digital Flexor/Extensor Tendons###
- Run to the **digits of the manus and foot** within sheaths.  
- **Function:** Control feathers and grasping during perching.

###3. Supracoracoideus Tendon###
- Passes through the **triosseal canal** to the dorsal humerus.  
- **Function:** Lifts the wing on the **upstroke**.

###4. Retinacula (Flexor/Extensor)###
- Fibrous bands at the **carpus and tarsus**.  
- **Function:** Hold tendons in place and prevent bowstringing.

##Function##
- **Force Transmission:** Convey muscle power to bones.  
- **Elastic Storage:** Recoil aids efficiency in flight and running.  
- **Precision:** Guide fine movements of feathers and digits.  
- **Protection:** Sheaths and pulleys reduce friction and wear.

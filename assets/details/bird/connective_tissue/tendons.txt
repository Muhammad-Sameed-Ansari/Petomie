#Tendons#

In birds, tendons attach muscles to bones, transmitting powerful energy for movement and flight.  
They are strong, elastic, and adapted for endurance.  
Energetically, they represent **willpower, resilience, and freedom of expression**.

###Parts###

##Flight Tendons##  
Enable wing motion and endurance during long flights.  
Energetically, they symbolize **strength and persistence**.

##Leg Tendons##  
Support perching, walking, and landing.  
Energetically, they reflect **grounding and stability**.

##Elastic Tendons##  
Store and release energy efficiently during takeoff and landing.  
Energetically, they embody **momentum, courage, and readiness**.

###Function###  
Tendons convert muscle power into flight and motion.  
Energetically, they sustain **direction, strength, and graceful action**.

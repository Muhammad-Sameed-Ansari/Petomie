#Vestibular System#

The bird’s vestibular system maintains balance, coordination, and spatial orientation — essential for flight.  
Energetically, it represents stability, movement harmony, and centered awareness.

###Parts###

##Semicircular Canals##
Fluid-filled loops detecting rotational movements.  
Energetically, symbolize fluidity, adaptability, and directional awareness.

##Utricle and Saccule##
Detect linear movement and gravitational pull.  
Energetically, reflect grounding, stability, and inner equilibrium.

##Vestibular Nerve##
Carries balance signals to the brain.  
Energetically, embodies coordination and connection.

###Function###
The vestibular system helps birds balance during perching, walking, and flying.  
Energetically, it anchors presence, motion harmony, and centered awareness.

###Common Imbalances###
Dizziness: infection or injury.  
Unsteady movement: nerve disruption.  
Energetically, imbalance may represent instability, overwhelm, or loss of direction.

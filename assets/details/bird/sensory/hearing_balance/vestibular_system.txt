#Vestibular System (Balance)#

##Location##
Medial to the middle ear within the **bony labyrinth** of the inner ear, continuous with the cochlear region.

###Shape###
Interconnected sacs and **three semicircular canals** oriented roughly orthogonally to detect angular and linear acceleration.

##Parts##
###1. Semicircular Canals (Anterior, Posterior, Lateral)###
Fluid-filled loops with sensory **ampullae**.  
**Function:** Detect **angular acceleration** (head rotation).

###2. Utricle###
Otolith organ connected to semicircular canals.  
**Function:** Senses **horizontal linear acceleration** and head tilt.

###3. Saccule###
Smaller otolith organ.  
**Function:** Senses **vertical linear acceleration** and vibration.

###4. Hair Cells with Otoconia###
Sensory cells topped by crystals in maculae.  
**Function:** Translate motion/tilt into neural signals.

##Function##
- **Equilibrium:** Maintains posture and gaze stabilization during flight and perching.  
- **Reflexes:** Drives vestibulo-ocular and vestibulospinal reflexes for head/eye coordination.  
- **Navigation:** Aids spatial orientation with visual and proprioceptive input.  
- **Integration:** Signals travel via vestibular branch of CN VIII to brainstem and cerebellum.

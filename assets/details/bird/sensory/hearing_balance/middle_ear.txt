#Middle Ear#

##Location##
Air-filled cavity between the **tympanic membrane** and the **inner ear (oval window)**, connected to the pharynx via the **Eustachian (pharyngotympanic) tube**.

###Shape###
Compact space containing a **single ossicle** (the **columella**, homologous to the stapes) with supporting ligaments and muscles.

##Parts##
###1. Tympanic Membrane###
Thin membrane separating external canal from middle ear.  
**Function:** Vibrates in response to sound waves.

###2. Columella (Stapes)###
Single auditory ossicle contacting the oval window.  
**Function:** Transmits and amplifies vibrations to inner ear fluids.

###3. Eustachian Tube###
Canal connecting middle ear to pharynx (often paired openings).  
**Function:** Equalizes air pressure across the tympanic membrane.

###4. Middle Ear Muscles and Ligaments###
Small stabilizing structures.  
**Function:** Tension control on the columella and membrane; protects from excessive vibration.

##Function##
- **Impedance Matching:** Efficient transfer of airborne sound to fluid-filled inner ear.  
- **Pressure Equalization:** Maintains optimal membrane motion.  
- **Protection:** Damps loud sounds and mechanical shocks.

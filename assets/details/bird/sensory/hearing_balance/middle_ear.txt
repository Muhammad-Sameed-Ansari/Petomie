#Middle Ear#

The bird’s middle ear contains a single bone that transmits sound vibrations efficiently.  
It bridges the outer and inner ear, enabling acute hearing.  
Energetically, it represents translation, understanding, and balanced perception.

###Parts###

##Columella##
The single ossicle that transfers sound from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear.  
Energetically, symbolizes clarity, communication, and inner alignment.

##Tympanic Membrane##
A thin membrane that vibrates when sound waves strike it.  
Energetically, reflects sensitivity and responsiveness.

###Function###
The middle ear amplifies and transmits sound, helping birds detect calls, danger, and environmental cues.  
Energetically, it encourages inner understanding and attunement.

###Common Imbalances###
Infection: inflammation reducing hearing ability.  
Pressure imbalance: environmental changes affecting vibration.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect miscommunication or inner tension.

#Inner Ear – Auditory (Cochlear) Part#

##Location##
Embedded within the **otic capsule** of the skull’s temporal region, medial to the middle ear.

###Shape###
A short, slightly curved **cochlear duct** (not coiled like mammals) containing the **basilar papilla** (avian equivalent of the organ of Corti).  
Ends in the **lagena**, a specialized terminal region in many birds.

##Parts##
###1. Basilar Papilla###
Sensory epithelium with hair cells on the basilar membrane.  
**Function:** Converts mechanical vibrations into nerve impulses (hearing).

###2. Tectorial Structure###
Gelatinous overlying membrane contacting hair cell stereocilia.  
**Function:** Mediates shearing forces for mechanoelectrical transduction.

###3. Oval and Round Windows###
Membrane-covered openings between middle and inner ear.  
**Function:** Admit mechanical input (oval) and allow pressure relief (round).

###4. Lagena###
Terminal specialization at the distal end of the cochlea.  
**Function:** Extends frequency sensitivity; may aid low-frequency detection (species-dependent).

##Function##
- **Auditory Transduction:** Hair cells translate vibrations to neural signals via the cochlear branch of CN VIII.  
- **Frequency Analysis:** Regional tuning along basilar papilla.  
- **Sensitivity Optimization:** Structural specializations enhance hearing relevant to species ecology.

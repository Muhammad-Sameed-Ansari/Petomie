#Inner Ear (Cochlea)#

The bird’s inner ear converts sound vibrations into electrical signals interpreted by the brain.  
It supports hearing precision and pitch detection.  
Energetically, it represents deep listening, intuition, and resonance.

###Parts###

##Cochlea##
A slightly curved structure containing sensory hair cells that detect vibrations.  
Energetically, symbolizes inner truth and subtle perception.

##Hair Cells##
Specialized receptors that transform vibrations into nerve signals.  
Energetically, reflect sensitivity and adaptability.

##Auditory Nerve##
Carries sound information to the brain for interpretation.  
Energetically, embodies communication and connection.

###Function###
The inner ear enables detailed sound recognition, communication, and spatial awareness.  
Energetically, it supports inner clarity, alignment, and intuitive hearing.

###Common Imbalances###
Hearing loss: age or infection.  
Hair cell damage: loud noise exposure.  
Energetically, imbalance may represent disconnection or difficulty hearing inner guidance.

#External Ear#

Birds lack external ear flaps, but they possess a streamlined opening hidden beneath feathers.  
It directs sound waves into the ear while reducing wind noise during flight.  
Energetically, it represents awareness, receptivity, and sensitivity to subtle signals.

###Parts###

##Ear Opening (Meatus)##
A small opening on each side of the head, protected by auricular feathers.  
Energetically, symbolizes openness and selective listening.

##Auricular Feathers##
Specialized feathers that shield the ear opening from wind and debris.  
Energetically, reflect protection, filtering, and refined perception.

###Function###
The external ear channels sound into the middle ear while minimizing noise interference.  
Energetically, it supports clear perception and conscious awareness.

###Common Imbalances###
Blocked opening: debris or feather impaction.  
Noise sensitivity: stress from loud environments.  
Energetically, imbalance may represent overwhelm or difficulty filtering information.

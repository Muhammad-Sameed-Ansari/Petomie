#External Ear#

##Location##
Located on the **lateral sides of the head**, posterior to the eyes and beneath layers of **auricular (ear covert) feathers**.  
Opens to the outside via the **external acoustic meatus** (no projecting pinna like mammals).

###Shape###
A short canal leading inward, surrounded by specialized feathers shaped to channel and protect sound entry.  
Feather arrangement can be asymmetrical in some species (e.g., owls) to aid sound localization.

##Parts##
###1. Auricular (Ear Covert) Feathers###
Specialized contour feathers over the ear opening.  
**Function:** Streamline airflow in flight and filter/guide sound into the meatus.

###2. External Acoustic Meatus###
Short tube leading to the tympanic membrane.  
**Function:** Conducts sound waves; protects the middle ear.

###3. Skin and Glands###
Lining of meatus with minimal ceruminous activity.  
**Function:** Maintains canal health and reduces debris.

##Function##
- **Sound Capture:** Directs and modulates incoming sound.  
- **Protection:** Shields tympanic membrane from dust and turbulence.  
- **Aerodynamics:** Reduces drag and noise interference during flight.

#Pecten Oculi#

##Location##
Projects from the **optic disc** into the vitreous body of the eye.  
Unique to birds and located within the posterior chamber.

###Shape###
Fan-shaped, pleated, and highly vascular structure composed of pigmented blood vessels.  
Varies in size and number of folds among species (typically 10–15 pleats).

##Parts##
###1. Vascular Folds###
Thin ridges containing dense capillaries.  
**Function:** Supply nutrients and oxygen to the retina.

###2. Pigmented Cells###
Dark melanin-rich tissue.  
**Function:** Absorbs excess light to minimize glare.

###3. Basal Attachment###
Anchored to the optic disc.  
**Function:** Supports stability and prevents movement during eye motion.

##Function##
- **Nutrition:** Delivers nutrients to the avascular retina.  
- **Optical Clarity:** Reduces retinal blood vessels, improving visual sharpness.  
- **Light Absorption:** Minimizes internal reflection and glare.  
- **Evolutionary Adaptation:** Enhances high-resolution vision without impairing transparency.

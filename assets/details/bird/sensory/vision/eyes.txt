#Eyes#

##Location##
Positioned on either side of the head within the **bony orbits**.  
Large in proportion to skull size, providing a wide field of view.  
In predatory birds, eyes are oriented more forward for enhanced depth perception.

###Shape###
Spherical to tubular, depending on species.  
Raptors have **tubular eyes** for magnified distance vision, while songbirds have more rounded eyes for a broader field of view.

##Parts##
###1. Cornea###
Transparent, curved front layer.  
**Function:** Refracts and focuses incoming light.

###2. Lens###
Soft, spherical, and highly flexible.  
**Function:** Adjusts shape to focus at varying distances.

###3. Iris###
Colored muscular ring surrounding the pupil.  
**Function:** Controls light entry; color varies by species and age.

###4. Retina###
Inner sensory layer containing photoreceptors (rods and cones).  
**Function:** Converts light into nerve signals sent to the brain.

###5. Nictitating Membrane###
Transparent third eyelid that moves horizontally across the eye.  
**Function:** Protects and moistens the eye during flight, feeding, or dust exposure without obstructing vision.

###6. Sclera###
Tough outer layer forming the white of the eye, supported by bony **sclerotic rings**.  
**Function:** Maintains eye shape and protects internal structures.

##Function##
- **Vision:** Provides high-resolution image detection and color perception.  
- **Protection:** Shields eyes from debris and desiccation during flight.  
- **Adaptation:** Eye structure varies with lifestyle (predator vs. prey).  
- **Focus Adjustment:** Rapid accommodation for sharp distance and near vision.

#Retina#

The bird’s retina contains high densities of photoreceptors, enabling extraordinary color vision, motion detection, and clarity.  
Energetically, it represents **perception, illumination, and inner truth**.

###Parts###

##Photoreceptors (Rods and Cones)##
Detect light, motion, and a wide range of colors.  
Energetically, symbolize awareness and sensitivity.

##Fovea##
A high-resolution region for detailed vision in many birds.  
Energetically, represents focus and precision.

##Retinal Layers##
Process visual information before sending it to the optic nerve.  
Energetically, reflect depth, integration, and layered understanding.

###Function###
The retina receives light, processes visual signals, and shapes a bird’s perception of the world.  
Energetically, it encourages clarity, illumination, and conscious perspective.

###Common Imbalances###
Degeneration: age-related visual decline.  
Inflammation: infection or irritants.  
Energetically, imbalance may indicate difficulty perceiving truth or loss of clarity.

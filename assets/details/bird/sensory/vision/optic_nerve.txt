#Optic Nerve#

The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain, enabling rapid perception essential for flight and survival.  
Energetically, it represents **connection, communication, and the transfer of insight**.

###Parts###

##Nerve Fibers##
Bundles of axons that transmit electrical signals.  
Energetically, symbolize communication and direction.

##Meningeal Coverings##
Protect the nerve as it travels toward the brain.  
Energetically, reflect support and safeguarding of inner truth.

###Function###
The optic nerve rapidly transfers processed light signals, enabling birds to react to movement and navigate precisely.  
Energetically, it supports clarity, awareness, and intuitive response.

###Common Imbalances###
Compression: injury or inflammation.  
Transmission issues: disease or nutritional deficits.  
Energetically, imbalance may indicate blocked communication or unclear guidance.

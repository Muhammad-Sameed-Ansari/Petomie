#Optic Nerve#

##Location##
Emerges from the **posterior surface of the eyeball**, extending toward the **optic lobes** of the midbrain.  
Crosses at the **optic chiasm**, where fibers partially decussate (cross over).

###Shape###
Thick, cylindrical bundle of nerve fibers covered by a myelin sheath.  
Adapted for rapid impulse transmission.

##Parts##
###1. Retinal Ganglion Fibers###
Axons originating from retinal neurons.  
**Function:** Transmit visual signals from retina to brain.

###2. Optic Chiasm###
Junction where optic nerves from both eyes meet and partially cross.  
**Function:** Enables binocular integration and depth perception.

###3. Optic Tract###
Continues from chiasm to optic lobes.  
**Function:** Delivers visual information for processing.

##Function##
- **Signal Transmission:** Carries visual impulses from eyes to brain.  
- **Image Integration:** Allows comparison of input from both eyes.  
- **Coordination:** Facilitates reflexes and movement responses to visual stimuli.  
- **Processing Link:** Connects directly to large optic lobes in birds for rapid response.

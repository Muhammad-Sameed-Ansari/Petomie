#Retina#

##Location##
Innermost layer of the eyeball, lining the posterior chamber.  
Connected to the optic nerve at the optic disc.

###Shape###
Thin, delicate membrane composed of photoreceptor cells, neurons, and supportive pigment epithelium.  
Highly specialized for color detection and light sensitivity.

##Parts##
###1. Rod Cells###
Sensitive to dim light and motion.  
**Function:** Enable night and low-light vision.

###2. Cone Cells###
Responsive to color and fine detail.  
**Function:** Provide color vision, including ultraviolet detection in many species.

###3. Fovea Centralis###
Area of dense cone concentration.  
**Function:** Provides sharpest visual acuity.

###4. Double Foveae###
Some birds (e.g., hawks, eagles, pigeons) have **two foveae** — one central for forward vision and one temporal for lateral vision.  
**Function:** Enables simultaneous focus on near and distant objects.  
**Note:** Not all birds possess double foveae; many species, such as owls and songbirds, have only one.

###5. Pigmented Epithelium###
Dark layer behind retina.  
**Function:** Absorbs stray light and reduces glare.

##Function##
- **Light Detection:** Converts light energy into electrical impulses.  
- **Color Perception:** Distinguishes a wide range of hues, including UV.  
- **Detail Resolution:** Ensures precision in navigation and foraging.  
- **Adaptation:** Adjusts sensitivity for day and night activity.

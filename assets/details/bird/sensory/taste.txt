#Taste System#

The bird’s taste system is simple compared to mammals but is finely tuned to detect safe foods.  
Energetically, it represents discernment, nourishment, and instinctive trust.

###Parts###

##Tongue##
Often narrow or specialized depending on species, assisting with food handling and limited taste.  
Energetically, symbolizes expression, contact, and sensory engagement.

##Taste Buds##
Scattered on the back of the tongue and throat, detecting mainly bitter, sour, and limited savory tastes.  
Energetically, reflect discernment and selective nourishment.

##Oral Cavity##
Supports food manipulation and early taste perception.  
Energetically, embodies reception, readiness, and acceptance of nourishment.

##Nerves (Glossopharyngeal and Vagus)##
Carry taste information to the brain.  
Energetically, represent communication between instinct, body, and awareness.

###Function###
The taste system protects birds from toxic plants or spoiled food and helps them choose species‑appropriate nutrition.  
Energetically, it encourages trust in instinct, nourishment choices, and connection to life‑sustaining rhythms.

###Common Imbalances###
Reduced appetite: illness, stress, or environmental change.  
Food avoidance: digestive discomfort or toxin sensitivity.  
Energetically, imbalance may represent hesitation, mistrust, or difficulty receiving nourishment.

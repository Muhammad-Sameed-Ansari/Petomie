#Taste Organs (Gustatory System)#

##Location##
Taste buds are located mainly on the **roof of the mouth (choanal region)**, **base of the oral cavity**, and along the **tongue margins** (species dependent).  
Fewer in number than mammals, often clustered near areas contacting food during swallowing.

###Shape###
Microscopic **taste buds** embedded within the oral epithelium, forming small pits or pores that open to the surface.  
Associated with gustatory nerve fibers from cranial nerves VII, IX.

##Parts##
###1. Taste Bud Pores###
Openings on the mucosal surface.  
**Function:** Allow dissolved chemicals to contact receptor cells.

###2. Receptor (Gustatory) Cells###
Specialized epithelial cells.  
**Function:** Transduce chemical stimuli (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami) into nerve signals.

###3. Supporting Cells###
Surround receptor cells.  
**Function:** Provide structural and metabolic support.

##Function##
- **Food Selection:** Distinguish palatable from harmful substances.  
- **Nutrient Detection:** Sense salts, amino acids, and sugars for diet regulation.  
- **Protective Reflexes:** Trigger rejection of bitter or toxic items.  
- **Integration:** Work with tactile cues during feeding to guide swallowing.

###Species Variation###
Number and distribution of taste buds vary widely.  
Waterfowl and chickens may have **hundreds**; parrots and pigeons often have fewer.  
Some species rely more on vision and touch than taste.

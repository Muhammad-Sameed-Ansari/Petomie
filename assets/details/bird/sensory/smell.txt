#Olfactory System (Smell)#

##Location##
Centered in the **nasal cavity**, with **olfactory epithelium** lining dorsal nasal regions and **olfactory bulbs** at the front of the brain.  
Olfactory nerves (Cranial Nerve I) pass through the skull to connect epithelium to the bulbs.

###Shape###
Consists of a **sensory epithelium** with ciliated receptor neurons, supporting cells, and mucus, plus bulb and tract structures in the brain.  
Extent and thickness vary by species depending on reliance on smell.

##Parts##
###1. Olfactory Epithelium###
Ciliated receptor neurons and supporting cells.  
**Function:** Detect airborne odor molecules.

###2. Olfactory Bulbs###
Paired neural structures at brain’s anterior.  
**Function:** Process and relay smell signals to higher centers.

###3. Olfactory Nerves (CN I)###
Bundles of axons from receptor neurons.  
**Function:** Transmit signals from epithelium to bulbs.

##Function##
- **Foraging:** Locates food sources (e.g., carrion, marine prey).  
- **Navigation:** Assists homing and migration in some species.  
- **Social/Mating Cues:** Contributes to individual and nest recognition.  
- **Integration:** Works alongside vision and hearing for environmental awareness.

###Species Variation###
Olfactory acuity differs greatly.  
**Kiwis, vultures, and seabirds** show strong smell capability, while many **songbirds and raptors** rely more on vision; their olfactory regions are proportionally smaller.

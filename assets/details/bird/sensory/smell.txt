#Smell System#

The bird’s smell system varies by species, adapted for navigation, food detection, social communication, and environmental awareness.  
Energetically, it represents intuition, orientation, and subtle perception — sensing what is unseen.

###Parts###

##Nostrils (Nares)##
Located at the base of the beak, allowing air and scent molecules to enter.  
Energetically, symbolize opening, curiosity, and perception.

##Nasal Cavity##
Filters, warms, and analyzes incoming air.  
Energetically, reflects clarity and refined awareness.

##Olfactory Epithelium##
The sensory tissue that detects scent particles.  
Energetically, represents sensitivity and subtle insight.

##Olfactory Bulbs##
Brain structures that process smell information.  
Energetically, embody intuition, decision-making, and direction.

###Function###
The smell system helps birds locate food, recognize mates or young, avoid dangers, and navigate long distances.  
Energetically, it supports orientation, instinctive wisdom, and inner guidance.

###Common Imbalances###
Reduced smell: respiratory infection or irritation.  
Misnavigation: environmental toxins or stress.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect confusion, disconnection, or dulled intuition.

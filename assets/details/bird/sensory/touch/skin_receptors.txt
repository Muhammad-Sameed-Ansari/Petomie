#Skin Receptors (Tactile)#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the **integument**—skin of the head, neck, trunk, wings, legs, and around feather follicles.  
Densities vary by region; elevated around beak base, feet, and wing edges involved in perching and flight.

###Shape###
Microscopic **mechanoreceptors** embedded in dermis and around follicles.  
Appear as encapsulated corpuscles (Grandry, Herbst) or unencapsulated endings (Merkel complexes).

##Parts##
###1. Grandry Corpuscles (Rapid‑Adapting)###
Flattened, layered end‑organs near the epidermis (especially in waterfowl).  
**Function:** Detect **light touch and low‑frequency vibration**, useful for object discrimination on wet/soft surfaces.

###2. Herbst Corpuscles (Rapid‑Adapting, Deep)###
Elongated, onion‑like encapsulated receptors around **feather follicles, periosteum, tendons**, and plantar skin.  
**Function:** Sense **pressure and high‑frequency vibration**; important for detecting airflow and substrate changes.

###3. Merkel Cell–Neurite Complexes (Slow‑Adapting)###
Superficial, disc‑like endings in epidermis.  
**Function:** Encode **sustained pressure and texture**, aiding grip and surface evaluation.

##Function##
- **Touch Detection:** Perceive pressure, vibration, and texture across the body.  
- **Grip & Posture:** Support precise foot placement and perching stability.  
- **Feather Feedback:** Provide signals from follicle bases for orientation and grooming.  
- **Flight Modulation:** Contribute to sensing airflow and wing–air interactions.

#Skin Receptors#

A bird’s skin contains sensory receptors that monitor touch, temperature, pain, and environmental changes.  
Energetically, they represent **protection, presence, and embodied awareness**.

###Parts###

##Touch Receptors##
Detect gentle contact, pressure, and texture.  
Energetically, symbolize connection, trust, and boundaries.

##Pain Receptors##
Alert the bird to injury or harmful stimuli.  
Energetically, reflect self-protection and awareness of limits.

##Temperature Receptors##
Monitor heat and cold, helping birds regulate behavior and comfort.  
Energetically, embody adaptability and balance.

###Function###
Skin receptors protect birds from harm, guide movement, and influence comfort and safety.  
Energetically, they anchor presence, self-awareness, and environmental harmony.

###Common Imbalances###
Skin irritation: parasites, dryness, or stress.  
Reduced sensitivity: injury or inflammation.  
Energetically, imbalance may represent weakened boundaries or discomfort in the environment.

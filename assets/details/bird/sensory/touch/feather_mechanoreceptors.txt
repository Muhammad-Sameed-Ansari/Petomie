#Feather Mechanoreceptors#

Bird feathers contain specialized sensors that detect air movement, position, and pressure — essential for flight control and awareness.  
Energetically, they represent **freedom, perception, and subtle energetic flow**.

###Parts###

##Filoplumes##
Hair-like feathers with sensory bases that detect feather position.  
Energetically, symbolize precision, awareness, and alignment.

##Herbst Corpuscles##
Pressure receptors located in feather follicles that sense movement and vibration.  
Energetically, reflect perception, sensitivity, and intuitive flow.

###Function###
Feather mechanoreceptors guide flight adjustments, balance, grooming, and communication.  
Energetically, they encourage harmony, fluidity, and attunement to subtle shifts.

###Common Imbalances###
Broken feathers: reduced sensing ability.  
Follicle irritation: stress or environmental triggers.  
Energetically, imbalance may indicate disrupted flow or reduced sensitivity to surrounding energies.

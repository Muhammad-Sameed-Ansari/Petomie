#Feather Mechanoreceptors#

##Location##
Associated with **feather follicles** across wings, tail, and body; densest along **leading and trailing wing edges** and at the tail for aerodynamic control.

###Shape###
Encapsulated **Herbst corpuscles** clustered around follicle bases and within follicle sheaths; specialized small feathers (**filoplumes**) closely paired to contour or flight feathers.

##Parts##
###1. Follicular Herbst Corpuscles###
Encapsulated, onion‑like receptors at feather bases.  
**Function:** Detect **minute shaft movements** and **airflow‑induced vibrations**.

###2. Filoplumes###
Slender, hair‑like feathers with a few barbs, richly innervated.  
**Function:** Act as **motion sensors** for adjacent flight feathers; report feather angle and flutter.

###3. Calamus (Feather Shaft Base) Sensory Field###
Ring of receptors and nerve endings around the calamus.  
**Function:** Provide **proprioceptive feedback** on feather position and load.

##Function##
- **Flight Control:** Rapidly report feather deflection to adjust wing/tail position.  
- **Aerodynamic Sensing:** Detect boundary‑layer changes and turbulence.  
- **Grooming & Posture:** Guide preening and feather maintenance.  
- **Communication Cues:** Sense feather vibrations during displays.

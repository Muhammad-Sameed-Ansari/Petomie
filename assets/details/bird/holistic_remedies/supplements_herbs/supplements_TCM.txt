#TCM Inspired Supplements#

###About Supplements###
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) views birds as highly sensitive beings with strong Shen, Lung, and Heart associations. TCM-inspired supplements for birds are selected very conservatively and are often best used energetically.

Alcohol-free, additive-free formulations are essential. Tinctures are generally not suitable for birds.

#Common Supplements#

###About Supplements###
Common supplements are widely used to support birds physically and nutritionally depending on species, age, environment, and health status.

For best outcomes, it is very important to choose supplements that are free from alcohol, artificial additives, fillers, colors, and flavors. Birds are highly sensitive, and clean, high-quality formulations are essential.

Supplements listed here may be used for energetic testing or, when appropriate, under professional avian veterinary guidance for physical use.

##Important Bird Safety Note##
Birds are extremely sensitive to supplements. Dosages must be very small and species-appropriate. Always consult an avian veterinarian before physical use.

#Nasal Salt Glands#

The bird’s nasal salt glands, located above the eyes, excrete excess salt through the nostrils.  
They are highly developed in seabirds but present in many species as small regulatory glands.  
Energetically, they represent **purification, balance, and adaptation**.

###Parts###

##Secretory Lobules##  
Remove salt from the blood.  
Energetically symbolize **cleansing and purification**.

##Excretory Ducts##  
Carry concentrated salt to the nostrils.  
Energetically represent **release and letting go**.

##Supraorbital Capsule##  
Protects the gland.  
Energetically reflects **stability and grounded equilibrium**.

###Function###  
Regulates salt and water balance, protecting the body from dehydration.  
Energetically supports **balance, clarity, and environmental adaptation**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivity: dehydration — energetically tied to **stress or environmental pressure**.  
Underactivity: poor salt balance — linked to **fatigue or weakened adaptation**.

#Thymus#

The bird’s thymus is a paired, elongated gland located on either side of the neck, running along the trachea.  
It plays a crucial role in early immune development by producing and training T-lymphocytes.  
Energetically, it represents purity, vitality, and the ability to stay resilient and balanced in changing environments.

###Parts###

##Cortex##  
The outer region where immature immune cells begin developing.  
Energetically, it symbolizes growth, adaptation, and forming healthy boundaries.

##Medulla##  
The inner region where T-cells mature into functional immune defenders.  
Energetically, it represents clarity, purpose, and refined inner protection.

##Thymic Lobules##  
Small, bead-like segments arranged along the gland’s length.  
Energetically, they reflect structure, guidance, and organized evolution.

###Function###  
The thymus produces and trains T-cells, forming the foundation of the bird’s adaptive immune system.  
It supports resilience against disease, environmental challenges, and stress.  
Energetically, it strengthens vitality, inner balance, and responsive awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak immunity: increased susceptibility to infection.  
Developmental issues in chicks: reduced immune development.  
Age-related atrophy: natural shrinking that limits new T-cell production.  
Energetically, imbalance may appear as sensitivity, agitation, or difficulty maintaining internal stability.

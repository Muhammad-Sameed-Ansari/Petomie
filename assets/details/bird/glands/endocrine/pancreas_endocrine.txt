#Pancreas#

The bird’s pancreas is an elongated, lobed gland located within the loop of the duodenum.  
It plays essential roles in both digestion and metabolic regulation, producing enzymes and hormones that support the bird’s high-energy physiology.  
Energetically, it represents balance, nourishment, and the flow between giving and receiving energetic resources.

###Parts###

##Exocrine Tissue##  
Produces digestive enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and proteases.  
Energetically, it symbolizes transformation, assimilation, and the ability to break down life’s experiences.

##Islets of Langerhans##  
Clusters of endocrine cells that produce insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.  
Energetically, they represent harmony, energetic regulation, and maintaining inner equilibrium.

##Pancreatic Ducts##  
Small channels that transport enzymes into the duodenum.  
Energetically, they reflect the pathways of flow, organization, and clear distribution of resources.

###Function###  
The pancreas aids digestion by releasing enzymes and regulates blood sugar through hormonal secretion.  
It ensures steady energy levels, nutrient absorption, and metabolic stability.  
Energetically, it supports adaptability, balanced vitality, and emotional steadiness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Digestive issues: poor enzyme output or malabsorption.  
Metabolic imbalance: irregular blood sugar or energy swings.  
Inflammation: stress or infection affecting digestive or hormonal balance.  
Energetically, imbalance may appear as overwhelm, depletion, or difficulty managing energetic input and output.

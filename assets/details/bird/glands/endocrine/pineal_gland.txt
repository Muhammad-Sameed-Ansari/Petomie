#Pineal Gland#

The bird’s pineal gland lies near the center of the brain and is highly light-sensitive.  
It regulates circadian rhythms, seasonal cycles, and melatonin production.  
Energetically, it represents intuition, spiritual sight, and inner rhythm.

###Parts###

##Light-Sensing Cells##  
Detect environmental light levels.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness and awakening.

##Secretory Core##  
Produces melatonin for daily and seasonal regulation.  
Energetically, it reflects harmony and natural flow.

##Neural Connections##  
Communicate timing signals to the brain.  
Energetically, they represent connection to universal cycles.

###Function###  
The pineal gland maintains sleep cycles, migration timing, and seasonal behaviors.  
Energetically, it supports intuition and spiritual balance.

###Common Imbalances###  
Cycle disruption: stress or artificial lighting.  
Low melatonin: exhaustion or imbalance.  
Energetically, this may reflect disconnection from natural rhythms.

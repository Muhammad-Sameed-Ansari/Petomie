#Cecal Tonsils#

The cecal tonsils sit at the base of the paired ceca.  
They contain lymphoid tissue that detects pathogens entering through the digestive tract.  
Energetically, they represent discernment, intuition, and protection of inner space.

###Parts###

##Lymphoid Nodules##  
Identify pathogens and activate immune responses.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness and inner vigilance.

##Mucosal Surface##  
Protects and supports digestion.  
Energetically, it reflects harmony and connection.

##Supportive Tissue##  
Anchors immune structures.  
Energetically, it represents grounding and stability.

###Function###  
The cecal tonsils guard the digestive tract and initiate immune responses.  
Energetically, they strengthen intuition and protect energetic boundaries.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: activation from pathogens.  
Weak function: lowered digestion or immunity.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty sensing what is beneficial or harmful.

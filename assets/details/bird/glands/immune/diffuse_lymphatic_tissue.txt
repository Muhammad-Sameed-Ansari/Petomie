#Diffuse Lymphatic Tissue#

Diffuse lymphatic tissue exists throughout the bird’s body, especially in the skin, respiratory tract, and digestive lining.  
It forms a widespread network of immune defense.  
Energetically, it represents overall protection, adaptability, and subtle strength.

###Parts###

##Scattered Lymphoid Cells##  
Detect pathogens and trigger responses.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness and gentle vigilance.

##Mucosal Clusters##  
Found in airways and intestines.  
Energetically, they reflect flow, sensitivity, and inner guidance.

##Support Matrix##  
Connective tissue supporting the immune cells.  
Energetically, it represents stability and resilience.

###Function###  
Diffuse lymphatic tissue provides rapid, flexible immune defense throughout the body.  
Energetically, it supports adaptability and subtle energetic protection.

###Common Imbalances###

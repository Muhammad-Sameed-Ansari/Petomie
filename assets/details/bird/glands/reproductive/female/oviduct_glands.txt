#Oviduct Glands#

The oviduct contains numerous glands that create albumen, membranes, and the shell.  
These glands support egg formation from start to finish.  
Energetically, they represent creation, development, and the shaping of new potential.

###Parts###

##Infundibulum Glands##  
Capture the ovulated yolk.  
Energetically, they symbolize receptivity and beginning.

##Magnum Glands##  
Produce albumen (egg white).  
Energetically, they reflect nourishment and supportive energy.

##Isthmus Glands##  
Form inner and outer eggshell membranes.  
Energetically, they represent structure and protection.

##Shell Gland (Uterus) Glands##  
Deposit calcium to form the shell.  
Energetically, they symbolize strengthening, manifestation, and completion.

###Function###  
These glands build the entire egg structure, layer by layer.  
Energetically, they support creation, development, and successful manifestation.

###Common Imbalances###  
Soft shells: calcium imbalance or stress.  
Egg binding: stagnation or low energy.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty completing tasks or expressing creation.

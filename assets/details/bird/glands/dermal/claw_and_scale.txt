#Claw and Scale Glands#

These small dermal glands lie within the skin of the feet, toes, and scales.  
They assist with maintaining keratin strength and provide subtle skin lubrication.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, stability, and secure movement.

###Parts###

##Micro-Glandular Units##  
Tiny clusters producing trace oils that support keratin health.  
Energetically, they symbolize subtle strength and resilience.

##Keratin Layer##  
Supports claws and scales and holds the gland ducts.  
Energetically, it reflects protection and rooted presence.

##Supportive Tissue##  
Anchors the glands within the skin.  
Energetically, it represents structural grounding.

###Function###  
These glands support claw and scale health and preserve flexibility in the skin of the feet.  
Energetically, they enhance grounding and secure movement through life.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dryness: depletion or lack of energetic grounding.  
Thickening: protective overcompensation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect instability or insecurity in one’s path.

#Skin Oil Micro-Glands#

Birds have small, scattered microscopic skin glands that support feather bases and maintain subtle moisture in the skin.  
Though minimal compared to mammals, they contribute to feather quality and comfort.  
Energetically, they represent softness, subtle nourishment, and gentle energetic balance.

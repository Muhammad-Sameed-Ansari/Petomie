#Filoplume Base Glands#

Tiny dermal glands located at the base of sensory feathers called filoplumes.  
They help condition these delicate feathers, supporting sensation and movement awareness.  
Energetically, they represent sensitivity, perception, and fine energetic tuning.

###Parts###

##Glandular Base##  
Secretes light oils for feather flexibility.  
Energetically, it signifies adaptability and responsiveness.

##Sensory Feather Root##  
Connected to nerves that detect feather movement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes awareness and intuitive perception.

##Support Cells##  
Maintain the integrity of the gland and feather.  
Energetically, they reflect balance and subtle strength.

###Function###  
These glands maintain the health of filoplumes, which help birds sense feather position and airflow.  
Energetically, they enhance awareness, attunement, and sensitivity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Feather brittleness: energetic rigidity.  
Irritation: overstimulation or environmental conflict.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty interpreting subtle cues.

#Accessory Glands#

##Location##
Located near the base of the **ductus deferens**, close to where it opens into the cloaca.
In most birds, these glands are small or absent, but in some species, they secrete fluid that helps nourish and transport sperm.

###Shape###
Tiny **lobed or tubular glands**, embedded in connective tissue around the terminal ducts.

###Parts###
Small clusters of secretory cells forming narrow ducts that open into the sperm passage.
Their size and presence vary widely among bird species.

###Function###
Produce seminal fluids that help transport and protect sperm.
Regulate moisture and pH balance within the reproductive tract.
Energetically, they create a smooth environment for life flow and creation.

###Energetic Connection###
Associated with **creativity and cooperation**.
Reflects the ability to prepare and support new beginnings.

###Common Imbalances###
Dryness or inflammation, low fertility, or disrupted sperm motility.
Energetically, blockages may show as resistance to nurturing or creative expression.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###
Support through hydration, gentle abdominal energy work, and sacral chakra alignment.
Visualize golden light flowing freely through the lower abdomen, restoring balance and flow.

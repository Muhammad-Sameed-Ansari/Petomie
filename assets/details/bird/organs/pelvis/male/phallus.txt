#Phallus#

##Location##
Located at the ventral wall of the **cloaca**, extending outward during mating.
Not all birds have a well-developed phallus — it is more distinct in species such as ducks and ostriches.

###Shape###
A **tubular, erectile organ** formed from lymphatic folds rather than blood tissue.

###Parts###
Base, body, and glans.
The lymphatic chambers within become turgid during copulation.

###Function###
Transfers sperm into the female cloaca during copulation.
Represents physical connection and continuation of life.
Energetically, it embodies creative transmission and unity.

###Energetic Connection###
Connected with **root and sacral energies**, representing vitality and grounded creation.

###Common Imbalances###
Swelling, injury, or infection.
Energetically, imbalance may appear as fear of connection or misuse of creative power.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###
Grounding energy work, pelvic release, or gentle visualization of pure golden-red light flowing through the base of the body to restore balance.

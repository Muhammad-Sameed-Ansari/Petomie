#Oviduct#

##Location##
The oviduct is a long, coiled tubular organ located on the left side of the abdominal cavity, extending from the ovary to the cloaca.
It lies parallel to the kidney and connects directly to the cloaca at its terminal end.

###Shape###
A flexible, elongated, and highly specialized tube, divided into distinct functional sections that progressively form the egg.

###Parts###

##Infundibulum##
Funnel-shaped opening near the ovary that captures the ovum after ovulation.
Energetically, represents reception and initiation.

##Magnum##
Longest section of the oviduct where albumen (egg white) is secreted.
Energetically, symbolizes nurturing and protection.

##Isthmus##
Shorter, narrower section where shell membranes are formed.
Energetically, reflects structure and boundary creation.

##Shell Gland (Uterus)##
Expands to allow shell formation and pigmentation.
Energetically, represents stability, containment, and completion.

##Vagina (Terminal Oviduct)##
Muscular passage leading to the cloaca, involved in egg laying and sperm regulation.
Energetically, symbolizes release and transition.

###Function###
Transports the ovum and sequentially forms the egg components: albumen, membranes, shell, and pigmentation.
Regulates fertilization, shell quality, and timing of egg laying.
Energetically, governs creation, protection, and rhythmic flow.

#Larynx#

##Location##
Located at the top of the trachea, just below the pharynx.

###Shape###
Small cartilaginous structure — less developed than in mammals. In birds, it functions mainly as a valve rather than a sound-producing organ.

##Function##
Regulates airflow to the trachea and prevents food from entering the airway.  
Sound in birds comes from the syrinx (further down the trachea), not the larynx.

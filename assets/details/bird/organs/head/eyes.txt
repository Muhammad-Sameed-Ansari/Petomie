#Eyes#

##Location##
Situated on the sides of the head, giving birds a wide field of vision. Some species (like owls) have forward-facing eyes for depth perception.

###Shape###
Round or slightly oval, large in proportion to the head. The shape varies depending on the bird’s lifestyle (predators have deeper eyes for sharp focus).

##Function##

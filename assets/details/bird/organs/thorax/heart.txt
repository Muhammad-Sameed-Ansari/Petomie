#Heart#

##Location##  
The bird’s heart lies within the **thoracic (coelomic) cavity**, centrally positioned on the midline, nestled between the lungs and closely associated with the **air sac system**.  
It sits just behind the sternum and is enclosed by the **pericardium**, with major vessels leaving from the base.

###Shape###  
A relatively large, strong, **cone-shaped muscular pump** (proportionally larger than in many mammals), adapted for high metabolic demand and sustained flight.  
It has four chambers — two atria and two ventricles — with a powerful left ventricle for systemic circulation.

###Parts###  

##Pericardium##  
A protective sac surrounding the heart that reduces friction and supports stable positioning.  
Energetically, represents **protection, boundaries, and emotional safety**.

##Right Atrium##  
Receives deoxygenated blood returning from the body through large veins (systemic venous return).  
Energetically, reflects **receiving support and being held**.

##Right Ventricle##  
Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the **pulmonary artery**.  
Energetically, symbolizes **release and clearing**.

##Left Atrium##  
Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the **pulmonary veins**.  
Energetically, represents **acceptance, openness, and renewal**.

##Left Ventricle##  
The strongest pumping chamber; sends oxygenated blood to the body through the **aorta**.  
Energetically, symbolizes **purpose, strength, and forward drive**.

##Interatrial Septum##  
Wall separating the right and left atria.  
Energetically, reflects **discernment and healthy separation**.

##Interventricular Septum##  
Wall separating the ventricles; supports efficient, coordinated contractions.  
Energetically, symbolizes **inner alignment and integrity**.

##Right AV Valve (Muscular Valve)##  
The valve between right atrium and right ventricle is largely **muscular** in birds (different from typical mammalian leaflet/chordae structure).  
It supports one-way flow into the right ventricle.  
Energetically, reflects **timing, trust, and clean transitions**.

##Left AV Valve (Mitral-Type Valve)##  
Between left atrium and left ventricle; ensures one-way flow into the powerful systemic ventricle.  
Energetically, symbolizes **heart-coherence and loyalty**.

##Pulmonary Valve##  
At the exit of the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery; prevents backflow from the lungs.  
Energetically, represents **cleansing and letting go**.

##Aortic Valve##  
At the exit of the left ventricle into the aorta; prevents backflow from the systemic circulation.  
Energetically, reflects **steady leadership and life-force distribution**.

##Great Vessels##  
**Cranial Venae Cavae:** return blood from head/neck/forelimbs to the right atrium.  
**Caudal Vena Cava:** returns blood from the body to the right atrium.  
**Pulmonary Artery:** carries blood from right ventricle to lungs.  
**Pulmonary Veins:** return oxygenated blood to left atrium.  
**Aorta:** carries oxygenated blood from left ventricle to the body.  
Energetically, reflect **flow, exchange, and life movement**.

##Coronary Vessels##  
Supply the heart muscle itself with oxygen and nutrients.  
Energetically, symbolize **self-nourishment and self-care**.

##Myocardium##  
Thick muscular layer that generates the pumping force, supporting the bird’s high-performance metabolism.  
Energetically, represents **courage, vitality, and emotional strength**.

##Endocardium##  
Smooth internal lining of the chambers and valves, supporting efficient blood flow.  
Energetically, reflects **clarity, purity, and smooth communication**.

##Cardiac Conduction System##  
Specialized electrical tissue coordinates heartbeat rhythm and timing for consistent circulation.  
Energetically, symbolizes **timing, harmony, and internal guidance**.

###Function###  
Pumps blood through:  
- **Pulmonary circulation:** heart → lungs → heart (oxygen exchange)  
- **Systemic circulation:** heart → body → heart (nutrients/oxygen delivery)  

Supports oxygen delivery for high energy demands, temperature regulation, and overall vitality.  
Energetically, governs **love, bonding, bravery, and emotional flow**.

###Energetic Connection###  
**Chakra:** Heart Chakra.  
**Meridian:** Heart and Pericardium Meridians.  
**Emotional Meaning:** Love, trust, connection, courage.  
**Balanced Energy:** Warmth, steadiness, resilience, open-hearted strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness, stress sensitivity, rhythm irregularities, reduced stamina.  
Energetically, **shock, fear, guardedness, or overexertion**.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###  
Provide a calm environment, gentle handling, and appropriate movement/flight time depending on the bird’s condition.  
**Colors:** Green and pink for harmony.  
**Crystals:** Rose quartz, aventurine for gentle heart support (kept safely out of reach).  
**Elements:** Air (breath/space) + Fire (warmth/vitality) to support rhythm.  
**Affirmation:** “My heart is steady, safe, and strong in loving connection.”

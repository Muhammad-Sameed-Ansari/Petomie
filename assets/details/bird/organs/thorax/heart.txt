#Heart#

##Location##
The heart lies in the **center of the chest**, between the **two lungs**, and just below the **thoracic inlet**.  
It is enclosed within the **pericardium**, positioned slightly forward compared to mammals.

###Shape###
A **cone-shaped muscular organ** proportionally larger than that of most mammals — supporting the bird’s high metabolism and flight energy.  
It consists of **four chambers** (two atria and two ventricles), ensuring efficient oxygen transport.

##Function##
- Pumps **oxygenated blood** at a high rate to sustain flight and activity.  
- Maintains **circulation** and body temperature.  
- Supports **muscle endurance** and metabolic strength.  
- Coordinates closely with the lungs and air sacs for continuous oxygen flow.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Heart Chakra (Anahata) — love, joy, and trust.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Heart and Pericardium Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The heart represents **joy of movement and emotional connection**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as fatigue, agitation, or withdrawal.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Strong rhythm, freedom, and love of life.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle handling, calm voice tones, and peaceful environments nurture heart balance.

#Lungs#

##Location##
The lungs are located within the **thoracic cavity**, attached firmly to the **ribs and vertebrae**.  
Unlike mammals, birds have **small, rigid lungs** that do not expand or contract directly — instead, air moves through them via a unique system of **air sacs**.

###Shape###
Compact, **spongy organs** with a pinkish color.  
Each lung connects to a series of **nine air sacs** distributed throughout the body, allowing continuous airflow.  
This design enables **efficient oxygen exchange** even during exhalation.

##Function##
- Absorb **oxygen** and release **carbon dioxide** efficiently through a **one-way airflow system**.  
- Maintain **steady oxygen levels** for flight and metabolism.  
- Filter and warm incoming air.  
- Work closely with the **air sacs** to cool the body and assist in vocalization.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Heart Chakra (Anahata) — freedom, openness, and breath of life.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Lung and Large Intestine Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** The lungs symbolize **freedom, expansion, and trust in movement**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as restricted breathing, fear of confinement, or sadness.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Open breath, peaceful rhythm, and lightness of being.  
- **Energetic Support:** Calm breathing, exposure to natural airflow, and gentle energy healing restore harmony.

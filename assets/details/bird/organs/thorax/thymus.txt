#Thymus#

##Location##
The thymus gland in birds is located along each side of the **neck**, just under the skin, instead of deep in the chest.  
It consists of **multiple lobes** on both sides of the trachea.

###Shape###
Several **elongated lobes** of soft lymphatic tissue that decrease in size as the bird matures.  
In young birds, these lobes are large and active; in adults, they shrink or disappear.

##Function##
- Produces **T-cells**, essential for immune defense.  
- Supports **immune development** and resistance to disease in young birds.  
- Links the **lymphatic and endocrine systems**.  
- Plays a vital role in growth and adaptation.

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** High Heart Chakra — protection, compassion, and vitality.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Lung and Heart Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Represents **innate trust, youthfulness, and the will to thrive**.  
  - Imbalance may appear as weakness, emotional stress, or lowered immunity.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Vitality, alertness, and emotional brightness.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle neck touch, calm breathing presence, and energetic warmth near the chest and neck restore thymus vitality.

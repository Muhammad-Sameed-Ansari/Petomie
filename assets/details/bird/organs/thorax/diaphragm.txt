#Diaphragm (Muscle)#

##Location##
Unlike mammals, birds **do not have a true diaphragm** separating the chest from the abdomen.  
Instead, thin **membranous walls and air sacs** perform a similar role in dividing and supporting breathing function.

###Shape###
No distinct muscle layer; instead, **air sacs and intercostal muscles** expand and contract to move air through the lungs.

##Function##
- Acts as a **respiratory partition** through air sac expansion and body wall motion.  
- Assists in **airflow and pressure balance**.  
- Coordinates movement between breathing, flight, and sound.  

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakra:** Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) — freedom, willpower, and motion.  
- **Meridian Connection:** Liver and Spleen Meridians.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Symbolizes **energetic flow and adaptability**.  
  - Imbalance may show as restlessness or difficulty grounding.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Fluid movement, steady rhythm, and openness.  
- **Energetic Support:** Gentle rhythmic motion, natural light exposure, and balance between stillness and activity enhance harmony.

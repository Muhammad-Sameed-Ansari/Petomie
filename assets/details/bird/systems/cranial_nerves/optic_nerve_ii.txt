The **optic nerve** carries visual information from the retina to the brain.  
Birds have some of the most advanced vision among all animals.  
Energetically, this nerve represents **clarity, perception, and awareness**.

###Parts###

##Retinal Fibers##
Transmit signals from photoreceptors.  
Energetically, symbolize **clarity and insight**.

##Optic Chiasm##
Where nerve fibers cross for depth and field perception.  
Energetically, represents **balance and integration**.

###Function###
Supports color vision, motion detection, navigation, hunting, and flight control.  
Energetically, governs **insight, awareness, and clear perception**.

###Common Imbalances###
Visual strain, blurred vision, or reduced tracking ability.

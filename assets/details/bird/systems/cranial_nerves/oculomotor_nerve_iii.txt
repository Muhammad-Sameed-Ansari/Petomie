#Oculomotor Nerve (III)#

The **oculomotor nerve** controls most of the bird’s eye movements and pupil response.  
It provides the fine motor control needed for precise visual tracking during flight.  
Energetically, it represents **focus, alignment, and direction**.

###Parts###

##Motor Fibers##
Control most external eye muscles.  
Energetically, symbolize **direction and purposeful movement**.

##Parasympathetic Fibers##
Regulate pupil constriction.  
Energetically, represent **adaptation and responsiveness**.

###Function###
Moves the eye, controls focus, and adjusts light intake.  
Energetically, supports **clarity, alignment, and inner focus**.

###Common Imbalances###
Difficulty tracking movement, drooping eyelid, or pupil dysfunction.  
Energetically, lack of direction or difficulty adjusting to change.

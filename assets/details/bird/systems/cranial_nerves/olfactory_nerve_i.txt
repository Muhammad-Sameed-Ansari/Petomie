#Olfactory Nerve (I)#

The **bird’s olfactory nerve** carries scent information from the nasal cavity to the brain.  
While reduced in many species, some birds—like vultures, kiwis, and seabirds—have a highly developed sense of smell.  
Energetically, this nerve represents **intuition, guidance, and subtle perception**.

###Parts###

##Olfactory Epithelium##
Receptors in the nasal cavity detecting chemical signals.  
Energetically, symbolizes **sensitivity and intuitive awareness**.

##Olfactory Bulb##
Brain region receiving scent information.  
Energetically, represents **inner knowing and direction**.

###Function###
Allows birds to detect scents, navigate environments, locate food, and identify territory.  
Energetically, supports **clarity, inner guidance, and instinctual wisdom**.

###Common Imbalances###

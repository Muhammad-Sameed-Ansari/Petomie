#Heart#

##Location##
Located in the **thoracic cavity**, between the lungs, slightly shifted to the left.  
Enclosed in a thin **pericardial sac**, supported by air sacs and the sternum.

###Shape###
A **four-chambered muscular organ**, similar to mammals but proportionally **larger and more powerful** to sustain flight.  
The walls of the left ventricle are particularly thick to pump oxygen-rich blood to the body.

##Parts##
###1. Right Atrium###
Receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the vena cavae.  
**Function:** Channels blood into the right ventricle.

###2. Right Ventricle###
Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs via pulmonary arteries.  
**Function:** Facilitates gas exchange in the lungs.

###3. Left Atrium###
Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs.  
**Function:** Directs oxygen-rich blood into the left ventricle.

###4. Left Ventricle###
Thickest chamber; pumps oxygenated blood to the entire body.  
**Function:** Supplies high-pressure flow to sustain flight muscles.

###5. Aortic Arch (Right)###
Birds retain only the right arch (unlike mammals).  
**Function:** Carries blood from the left ventricle to systemic arteries.

###6. Pericardium###
Membranous sac enclosing the heart.  
**Function:** Protects and lubricates during rhythmic movement.

##Function##
- **Circulation:** Maintains continuous blood flow through lungs and body.  
- **Oxygen Supply:** Meets high metabolic demands during flight.  
- **Temperature Control:** Assists in thermoregulation.  
- **Efficiency:** Fully separates oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

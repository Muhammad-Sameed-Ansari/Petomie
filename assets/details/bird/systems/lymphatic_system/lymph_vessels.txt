#Lymph Vessels#

##Location##
Bird lymph vessels run throughout the body, parallel to the circulatory system, collecting excess fluid from tissues and returning it to venous circulation.  
They are especially concentrated in the skin, digestive tract, and limb regions.

###Shape###
Thin, delicate channels that branch extensively, forming a semi‑transparent network of tubes with small valves.

###Parts###

Located near the skin.  
Energetically, symbolize **flow, cleansing, and gentle release**.

##Deep Lymph Vessels##
Run alongside major blood vessels.  
Energetically, represent **inner renewal and foundational balance**.

##Valves##
Ensure one‑way movement of lymph.  
Energetically, mirror **clear boundaries and directional purpose**.

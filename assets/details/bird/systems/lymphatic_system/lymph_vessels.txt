#Lymph Vessels#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the body, paralleling veins and capillaries.  
Present in the **skin, muscles, viscera, and mesenteries**, connecting to lymph hearts and veins.

###Shape###
Thin-walled transparent tubes equipped with **valves** that prevent backflow.  
Lack the distinct nodes found in mammals but form extensive drainage networks.

##Parts##
###1. Superficial Lymph Vessels###
Located under the skin.  
**Function:** Drain tissue fluid from surface regions.

###2. Deep Lymph Vessels###
Surround internal organs and muscles.  
**Function:** Collect interstitial fluid and metabolic waste.

###3. Valves###
Internal flaps ensuring one-way flow.  
**Function:** Maintain lymph direction toward veins.

##Function##
- **Fluid Balance:** Returns excess tissue fluid to venous circulation.  
- **Transport:** Carries immune cells and proteins.  
- **Support:** Works with lymph hearts to sustain steady lymph flow.  
- **Immunity:** Distributes immune factors from lymphoid tissues.

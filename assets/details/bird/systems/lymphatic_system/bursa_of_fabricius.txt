#Bursa of Fabricius#

##Location##
Situated **dorsal to the cloaca**, connected via a short duct.  
Active in juveniles and regresses in adults.

###Shape###
Pouch-like sac with folded mucosal walls lined by lymphoid follicles.  
Highly vascular and hormonally active.

##Parts##
###1. Mucosal Folds###
Contain lymphoid follicles.  
**Function:** Support B-cell development.

###2. Epithelial Covering###
Protective lining of folds.  
**Function:** Maintains internal environment for cell growth.

###3. Lymphoid Follicles###
Packed with developing B-lymphocytes.  
**Function:** Produce immune-competent B-cells.

##Function##
- **B-Cell Maturation:** Generates and trains antibody-producing cells.  
- **Immune Education:** Central to early adaptive immunity.  
- **Endocrine Interaction:** Coordinates with thymus and spleen in immune regulation.  
- **Regression:** Disappears after maturity when immune competence is established.

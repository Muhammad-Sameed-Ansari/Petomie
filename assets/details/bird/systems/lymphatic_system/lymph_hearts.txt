#Lymph Hearts#

##Location##
Found along lymph channels, typically near the **base of the tail**, **neck**, or **thighs** depending on species.  
More prominent in embryonic and juvenile birds.

###Shape###
Small, spindle-shaped or oval **contractile sacs** connected to lymph vessels and veins.  
Each has a muscular wall capable of rhythmic contraction.

##Parts##
###1. Dorsal Pair###
Located in lumbar or caudal region.  
**Function:** Propel lymph toward caudal veins.

###2. Cervical Pair###
Situated in the neck near jugular veins (in some species).  
**Function:** Assist upper body lymph drainage.

###3. Valves###
Prevent backflow into peripheral tissues.  
**Function:** Maintain directional lymph transport.

##Function##
- **Pumping:** Actively push lymph into the venous system.  
- **Circulation:** Maintain lymph flow where blood pressure is low.  
- **Embryonic Support:** Aid early immune and fluid circulation.  
- **Species Adaptation:** Support flight and upright posture by assisting return flow.

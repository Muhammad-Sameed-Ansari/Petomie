##Parts##
###1. Cortex###
Outer dense region of lymphocytes.  
**Function:** Site of T-cell proliferation.

###2. Medulla###
Inner lighter region with fewer cells.  
**Function:** Maturation of T-cells before release into circulation.

###3. Connective Capsule###
Thin fibrous covering separating lobes.  
**Function:** Protects tissue and supports blood supply.

##Function##
- **Immunity:** Produces and matures T-lymphocytes.  
- **Development:** Essential for early immune system formation.  
- **Endocrine Role:** Releases hormones regulating immune function.  
- **Involution:** Shrinks after maturity but leaves functional T-cell population.

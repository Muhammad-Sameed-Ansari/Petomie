#Diffuse Lymphoid Tissue#

##Location##
Scattered throughout the **digestive, respiratory, and integumentary systems**.  
Most abundant in **intestinal mucosa (Peyer's patches)**, **trachea**, and **skin**.

###Shape###
Irregular clusters or nodules of lymphocytes within connective tissue layers.  
May appear as organized follicles or diffuse accumulations.

##Parts##
###1. Mucosal Lymphoid Tissue###
In intestines and respiratory tracts.  
**Function:** Detects and responds to antigens entering via food or air.

###2. Cutaneous Lymphoid Clusters###
Found in skin and feather follicles.  
**Function:** Local defense and wound protection.

###3. Associated Follicles###
Around cloaca and pharynx.  
**Function:** Coordinate immune surveillance.

##Function##
- **Local Immunity:** Provides first-line defense at body surfaces.  
- **Detection:** Triggers immune responses to pathogens.  
- **Communication:** Links innate and adaptive immunity.  
- **Maintenance:** Ensures ongoing immune readiness in adult birds.

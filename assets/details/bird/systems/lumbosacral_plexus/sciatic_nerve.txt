#Sciatic Nerve (Ischiadic Nerve)#

##Location##
Emerges from the **lumbosacral plexus** deep in the pelvis and passes caudolateral to the hip into the **posterior thigh**, coursing between major thigh muscles toward the **knee** and **shank**.

###Shape###
A large, cord‑like **mixed nerve** that divides distally into **tibial** and **fibular (peroneal)** components.

##Parts##
###1. Proximal Trunk###
Formed by convergence of plexus roots.  
**Function:** Conducts high‑volume motor and sensory fibers to the hindlimb.

###2. Muscular Branches###
Branches to thigh flexors/extensors (species‑dependent).  
**Function:** Power locomotion, perching grip, and take‑off thrust.

###3. Tibial Division###
Medial continuation at the knee.  
**Function:** Innervates caudal leg and plantar foot; assists in gripping perch.

###4. Fibular (Peroneal) Division###
Lateral division near the knee.  
**Function:** Innervates craniolateral leg and dorsal foot; assists in digit extension and positioning.

##Function##
- **Motor:** Principal drive to thigh, leg, and foot musculature.  
- **Sensory:** Collects cutaneous and proprioceptive input from hindlimb.  
- **Coordination:** Enables powerful stance and precise toe control on perches.

#Hypothalamus#

##Location##
Located at the **base of the bird’s brain**, just beneath the **thalamus** and above the **pituitary gland**.  
It serves as the main link between the **nervous** and **endocrine systems**, regulating vital automatic functions.

###Shape###
A **small, almond-shaped** structure made of tightly packed nerve cells.  
It lies around the third ventricle and connects directly to the pituitary gland through neural and vascular pathways.

##Function##
Acts as the **central regulator** of internal balance in birds.  
- Controls **hormone release** through the pituitary gland.  
- Regulates **body temperature**, **thirst**, **feeding behavior**, and **sleep cycles**.  
- Balances **metabolism**, **stress response**, and **reproduction cycles** (influencing seasonal breeding).  
- Maintains **autonomic functions**, such as heart rate, respiration, and digestion.  
- Integrates environmental signals like light and temperature to guide physiological rhythms.

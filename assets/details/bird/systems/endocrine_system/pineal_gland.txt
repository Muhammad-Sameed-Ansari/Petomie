#Pineal Gland#

##Location##
Located in the **dorsal region of the brain**, near the midline above the cerebellum.  
Lies close to the skull surface to sense light.

###Shape###
Small, round to conical gland composed of light-sensitive pinealocytes.  
Highly vascular and connected to visual centers of the brain.

##Parts##
###1. Pinealocytes###
Specialized cells responsive to light.  
**Function:** Secrete melatonin.

###2. Nerve Fibers###
Connect to visual and hypothalamic regions.  
**Function:** Transmit light and circadian information.

##Function##
- **Circadian Rhythm:** Regulates sleep-wake cycles.  
- **Seasonal Behavior:** Controls migration and breeding timing.  
- **Hormonal Modulation:** Balances melatonin and reproductive hormones.  
- **Light Sensitivity:** Acts as a biological clock.

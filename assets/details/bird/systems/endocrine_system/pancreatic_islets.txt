###Shape###
Elongated, lobulated organ composed of both endocrine and exocrine tissue.  
Endocrine cells form small clusters known as islets of Langerhans.

###1. Alpha Cells###
Secrete glucagon.  
**Function:** Raise blood glucose by stimulating glycogen breakdown.

###2. Beta Cells###
Secrete insulin.  
**Function:** Lower blood glucose by promoting uptake into cells.

###3. Delta Cells###
Secrete somatostatin.  
**Function:** Inhibit other pancreatic secretions.

##Function##
- **Glucose Regulation:** Balances blood sugar levels.  
- **Energy Metabolism:** Supports sustained muscle activity.

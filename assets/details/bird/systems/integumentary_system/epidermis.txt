#Integumentary System – Epidermis (Bird)#

##Location##
The epidermis forms the **outermost layer** of the bird’s skin, covering the entire body, legs, feet, and head.  
It lies above the dermis and forms the base for feathers, scales, and beak coverings.

##Shape##
A **thin, keratinized layer** of epithelial cells that continuously renews.  
Thicker in areas exposed to friction such as feet and thinner on wings and abdomen.

##Parts##

###1. Stratum Corneum###
- Outermost layer of flattened keratinized cells.  
- **Function:** Provides waterproof protection and reduces water loss.  

###2. Stratum Basale###
- Deep layer where new skin cells form.  
- **Function:** Generates new cells and anchors feathers and scales.  

###3. Keratinocytes###
- Major cell type of the epidermis.  
- **Function:** Produce keratin for feathers, scales, and beak.  

##Function##
- **Protection:** Shields the body from dehydration and injury.  
- **Keratin production:** Forms feathers, scales, and beak coverings.  
- **Regeneration:** Replaces old or damaged cells.

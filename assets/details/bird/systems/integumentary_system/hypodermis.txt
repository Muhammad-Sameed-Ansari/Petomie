#Integumentary System – Hypodermis (Bird)#

##Location##
Lies **beneath the dermis**, attaching the skin to underlying muscles and bones.

##Shape##
A **thin, flexible layer** of loose connective tissue and fat deposits.  
Fat distribution varies between species and seasons.

##Parts##

###1. Adipose Tissue###
- Fat deposits under the skin.  
- **Function:** Provides insulation and stores energy.  

###2. Connective Tissue###
- Loose fibers that bind the skin to the body.  
- **Function:** Allows flexibility and movement.  

###3. Air Sacs (Adjacent)**  
- Present near some skin regions.  
- **Function:** Aid in thermoregulation and respiration.  

##Function##
- **Insulation:** Maintains body temperature.  
- **Energy reserve:** Stores fat for migration or breeding.  
- **Flexibility:** Attaches skin without restricting motion.

#Syrinx#

##Location##
The syrinx is located at the base of the trachea where it divides into the primary bronchi.  
It rests deep within the thoracic cavity, positioned at the key junction between upper and lower airflow pathways.

###Shape###
A complex, hollow structure formed from modified tracheal and bronchial rings.  
It includes vibrating membranes, supporting cartilages, and chambers that vary widely between bird species.

###Parts###

##Tympanum##
The modified tracheal ring that forms the upper portion of the syrinx.

##Bronchial Rings##

Energetically: embody **stability and grounded expression**.

##Interclavicular Air Sac Connection##
Surrounds and influences the syrinx's resonance.  
Energetically: symbolizes **amplification and inner expansion**.

###Function###
Produces sound by vibrating membranes as air flows through from the lungs and air sacs.

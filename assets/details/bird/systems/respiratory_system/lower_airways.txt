#Lower Respiratory System#

##Location##
Begins at the **bifurcation of the trachea (syrinx)** and extends into the **thoracic cavity**, encompassing the **lungs and air sacs**.  
Closely associated with ribs, vertebrae, and certain bones that connect to air sacs.

###Shape###
Composed of **small, rigid lungs** and a network of **thin-walled air sacs**.  
Lungs are non-expandable; air sacs act as bellows for airflow.  
Designed for lightweight structure and maximum oxygen exchange.

##Parts##

###1. Primary Bronchi###
Two main branches from the syrinx entering each lung.  
**Function:** Carry air to and from the lungs and air sacs.

###2. Secondary Bronchi###
Branch from primary bronchi into the lung tissue (medioventral, laterodorsal, etc.).  
**Function:** Distribute air evenly within lungs.

###3. Parabronchi###
Tiny parallel air capillaries connecting bronchi.  
**Function:** Site of gas exchange through unidirectional flow.

###4. Lungs###
Small, compact, and partially fused to ribs.  
**Function:** Facilitate oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange across parabronchial walls.

###5. Air Sacs###
Thin-walled extensions of the bronchi located throughout the body cavity and even into some bones.

**Types of Air Sacs (9 total):**
1. **Cervical Air Sacs (2)** – Neck region; connected to vertebrae.  
   **Function:** Cushion neck organs; aid cooling.  
2. **Clavicular Air Sac (1)** – Between collarbones; connects to humerus.  
   **Function:** Assists flight muscle ventilation; reduces weight.  
3. **Anterior Thoracic Air Sacs (2)** – In front of lungs.  
   **Function:** Receive exhaled air; assist unidirectional flow.  
4. **Posterior Thoracic Air Sacs (2)** – Behind lungs.  
   **Function:** Receive fresh air during inhalation; push it through lungs.  
5. **Abdominal Air Sacs (2)** – Extend into pelvic region.  
   **Function:** Aid breathing and regulate body temperature.

###6. Air Capillaries###
Microscopic tubules within parabronchi.  
**Function:** Exchange gases efficiently using cross-current flow.

##Airflow Pattern##
Bird respiration is **unidirectional**, ensuring continuous gas exchange even during exhalation.  
- **Inhalation 1:** Air enters posterior air sacs.  
- **Exhalation 1:** Air moves from posterior sacs → lungs (gas exchange).  
- **Inhalation 2:** Air moves from lungs → anterior sacs.  
- **Exhalation 2:** Air exits anterior sacs → trachea → outside.  
This two-cycle system provides constant oxygen flow through lungs.

##Function##
- **Gas Exchange:** Maintains continuous oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.  
- **Thermoregulation:** Aids cooling during flight.  
- **Buoyancy:** Reduces body density for efficient flight.  
- **Sound Support:** Maintains airflow for vocalization.  
- **Metabolic Efficiency:** Supports high-energy demands of flight.

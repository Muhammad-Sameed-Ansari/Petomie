#Upper Respiratory System#

##Location##
Extends from the **external nares (nostrils)** to the **syrinx** at the base of the trachea.  
Occupies the upper head and neck region, connecting the external environment to the lower respiratory tract.

###Shape###
A series of hollow passages and cartilaginous tubes lined with ciliated epithelium and mucus-secreting glands.  
Adapted to filter, warm, and moisten inhaled air before it reaches the lungs.

##Parts##

###1. External Nares###
Openings on the beak, often protected by a keratinized rim or operculum.  
**Function:** Admit and filter air entering the nasal cavity.

###2. Nasal Cavity###
Divided into chambers by **nasal conchae (turbinates)**.  
**Function:** Warm and humidify incoming air; trap dust and pathogens.

###3. Infraorbital Sinus###
Large cavity below the eyes connected to the nasal passages.  
**Function:** Equalizes pressure, reduces skull weight, and can aid in sound resonance.

###4. Glottis###
Opening into the larynx; lacks an epiglottis.  
**Function:** Controls airflow to the trachea.

###5. Larynx###
Cartilaginous structure at the base of the tongue.  
**Function:** Regulates airflow but does not produce sound (unlike in mammals).

###6. Trachea###
Long tube supported by complete cartilaginous rings.  
**Function:** Conducts air to the syrinx and lower system.

###7. Syrinx###
Located at the junction of the trachea and bronchi.  
**Function:** Primary organ of sound production; varies in complexity among species.

##Function##
- **Air Filtration:** Removes dust and microorganisms.  
- **Conditioning:** Warms and moistens inhaled air.  
- **Protection:** Mucus and cilia trap and expel debris.  
- **Communication:** Produces vocalizations through the syrinx.  
- **Conduction:** Directs air efficiently to the lower respiratory system.

#Gizzard (Ventriculus)#

##Location##
Located caudal to the **proventriculus**, between it and the **duodenum**.  
Prominent in granivorous birds, smaller in carnivorous ones.

###Shape###
A **thick-walled, muscular organ** lined with a **tough keratinized cuticle** (koilin layer).  
Contains grit or small stones used to grind food mechanically.

##Parts##
###1. Muscular Walls###
Powerful circular and longitudinal muscles.  
**Function:** Contract to crush and grind food particles.

###2. Koilin Lining###
Tough inner coating that protects from abrasion.  
**Function:** Enhances grinding efficiency.

###3. Grit Content###
Small stones or sand particles.  
**Function:** Aid mechanical breakdown of hard seeds.

##Function##
- **Grinding:** Mechanically processes food.  
- **Protection:** Prevents self-damage from friction.  
- **Assistance:** Works with proventriculus for complete digestion.  
- **Efficiency:** Replaces chewing function of teeth.

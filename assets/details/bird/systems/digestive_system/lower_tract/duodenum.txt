#Duodenum#

##Location##
Begins at the **pylorus of the gizzard** and forms a loop around the **pancreas**, continuing to the jejunum.

###Shape###
Forms a U-shaped loop with two parallel limbs.  
Has thin, folded mucosa to maximize absorption and facilitate enzyme mixing.

##Parts##
###1. Descending Limb###
Receives bile and pancreatic secretions.  
**Function:** Mixes digestive fluids with partially digested food.

###2. Pancreatic Loop###
Encircles the pancreas.  
**Function:** Integrates enzyme flow for chemical digestion.

###3. Ascending Limb###
Connects to jejunum.  
**Function:** Continues nutrient absorption.

##Function##
- **Digestion:** Mixes bile and pancreatic enzymes.  
- **Absorption:** Begins nutrient uptake.  
- **Integration:** Coordinates flow between gizzard and small intestine.

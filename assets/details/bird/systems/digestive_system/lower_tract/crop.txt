#Crop (Ingluvies)#

##Location##
Located on the **right side of the lower neck**, as an expansion of the esophagus before the thoracic inlet.  
Varies in size and shape depending on the species and diet.

###Shape###
A **thin-walled, sac-like structure** lined with mucus-secreting epithelium.  
Highly elastic and capable of large expansion for temporary food storage.

##Parts##
###1. Inlet (Esophageal Opening)###
Connects to the esophagus.  
**Function:** Allows food to enter from the upper digestive tract.

###2. Body of Crop###
Main storage chamber.  
**Function:** Temporarily holds and softens food.

###3. Outlet###
Connects to the lower esophagus or directly to the proventriculus.  
**Function:** Releases food gradually for digestion.

##Function##
- **Storage:** Holds food before digestion.  
- **Softening:** Moistens and partially ferments material.  
- **Feeding Young:** In some species, produces "crop milk."  
- **Regulation:** Controls food flow into the stomach.

#Esophagus#

##Location##
Extends from the **pharynx** to the **stomach (proventriculus)**, passing along the right side of the neck and thorax.  
In many species, the esophagus expands into the **crop** before entering the thoracic cavity.

###Shape###
A long, muscular tube with **folded mucosa** and **elastic walls**, allowing passage of variable-sized food items.  
The inner lining contains mucus-secreting glands to ease swallowing.

##Parts##
###1. Cervical Esophagus###
Upper section running through the neck.  
**Function:** Transports food to the crop or directly to the stomach.

###2. Thoracic Esophagus###
Lower section within the chest cavity.  
**Function:** Connects crop (if present) to proventriculus.

##Function##
- **Transport:** Moves food from mouth to stomach via peristalsis.  
- **Lubrication:** Mucus glands moisten and protect lining.  
- **Storage Support:** Feeds material into the crop when present.  
- **Adaptability:** Expands for large prey or grains.

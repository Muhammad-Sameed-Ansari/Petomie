#Oviduct#

##Location##
Extends from the **ovary to the cloaca** along the left side of the abdominal cavity.  
Highly coiled and suspended by a thin mesentery.

###Shape###
Long, muscular tube divided into **five distinct regions**, each with specialized glands and functions for egg formation.

##Parts##
###1. Infundibulum###
Funnel-shaped opening near the ovary.  
**Function:** Receives ovum; site of fertilization.

###2. Magnum###
Longest section of oviduct.  
**Function:** Secretes albumen (egg white).

###3. Isthmus###
Narrow middle segment.  
**Function:** Adds shell membranes around the egg.

###4. Shell Gland (Uterus)###
Thicker-walled portion near cloaca.  
**Function:** Deposits calcium shell and pigments.

###5. Vagina###
Muscular terminal section.  
**Function:** Expels egg into cloaca.

##Function##
- **Egg Formation:** Sequentially forms egg layers.  
- **Transport:** Moves egg toward cloaca via peristaltic movement.  
- **Fertilization:** Occurs in infundibulum before albumen is added.  
- **Protection:** Coats ovum with multiple protective layers.

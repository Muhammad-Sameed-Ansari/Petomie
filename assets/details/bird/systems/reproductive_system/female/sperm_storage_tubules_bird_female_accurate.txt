#Sperm Storage Tubules (SSTs)#

##Location##
Located at the **uterovaginal junction**, where the **vagina** meets the **shell gland (uterus)**.  
Found as small invaginations in the epithelial lining of this region.

###Shape###
**Microscopic, tubular structures** that form clusters within the mucosal folds.  
They are elongated and slightly coiled, extending from the vaginal wall into the tissue.

##Parts##

###1. Tubular Epithelium###
Lined with **columnar epithelial cells** that secrete nutrients to maintain sperm viability.

###2. Lumen###
The central cavity where **sperm are stored** after mating.

###3. Muscular Layer###
Thin smooth muscle layer that can contract slightly to help release sperm.

###Function###
Serves as the **primary sperm storage site** in female birds.  
Allows sperm to remain viable for several days or even weeks after copulation.  
Releases small numbers of sperm into the oviduct to fertilize successive eggs.  
Ensures **continuous fertilization** over a laying period without repeated mating.

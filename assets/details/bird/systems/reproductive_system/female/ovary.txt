###2. Germinal Epithelium###
Outer layer covering ovary.  
**Function:** Produces new follicles.

###3. Stromal Tissue###
Connective tissue framework.  
**Function:** Supports blood vessels and hormone production.

##Function##
- **Oogenesis:** Produces ova for fertilization.  
- **Hormone Secretion:** Releases estrogen and progesterone.  
- **Yolk Formation:** Provides nutrients to developing egg.

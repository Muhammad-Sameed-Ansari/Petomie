#Cloacal Region (Female)#

##Location##
Posterior end of the reproductive tract shared with the urinary and digestive systems.  
Divided into **coprodeum, urodeum, and proctodeum** regions.

###Shape###
A chamber-like structure with muscular walls and internal folds.  
Continuously connected to oviduct and cloacal sphincter.

##Parts##
###1. Urodeum###
Middle cloacal compartment receiving the oviduct, ureters, and reproductive openings.  
**Function:** Common passage for eggs, urine, and sperm.

###2. Coprodeum###
Anterior section connected to rectum.  
**Function:** Stores fecal material before elimination.

###3. Sperm Storage Tubules###
Present only in certain birds (e.g., hens, ducks, pigeons).  
**Function:** Store viable sperm for several days post-mating to allow delayed fertilization.

###4. Proctodeum###
Posterior segment leading to vent.  
**Function:** Serves as exit passage for all cloacal contents.

##Function##
- **Reproductive Junction:** Coordinates passage of eggs during oviposition.  
- **Sperm Storage (Selective Species):** Allows prolonged fertility after single mating.  
- **Excretory Integration:** Combines reproductive and waste elimination functions.  
- **Muscular Expulsion:** Facilitates cloacal opening during egg laying.

#Infundibulum#

##Location##
Most cranial and funnel-shaped region of the **oviduct**, lying close to the ovary.  
Opens into the body cavity to receive the ovum directly from the follicle.

###Shape###
Thin-walled funnel or trumpet-shaped tube lined with cilia.  
Measures about 7–10 cm in hens but varies with species.

##Parts##
###1. Fimbriae###
Fringed edges at the funnel’s mouth.  
**Function:** Sweep released ovum into oviduct.

###2. Tubular Portion###
Narrow section connecting to magnum.  
**Function:** Site of sperm entry and fertilization.

###3. Ciliated Epithelium###
Inner lining with moving cilia.  
**Function:** Propels ovum toward magnum.

##Function##
- **Ovum Reception:** Captures released egg.  
- **Fertilization:** First contact between ovum and sperm occurs here.  
- **Transport:** Moves fertilized ovum to magnum.  
- **Protection:** Prevents egg loss into body cavity.

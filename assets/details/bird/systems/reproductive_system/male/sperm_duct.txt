#Sperm Duct#

##Location##
Extends from the **epididymis** along the kidneys to the **cloaca**, running parallel to the ureters.  
Opens into the **urodeum**, the middle section of the cloaca.

###Shape###
A **long, slender, coiled tube** that becomes thicker and more convoluted during the breeding season.  
The wall is muscular and lined with ciliated epithelium.

##Parts##

###1. Proximal Segment###
Receives sperm from the epididymis.

###2. Middle Segment###
Acts as a **temporary storage site** and transports sperm toward the cloaca.

###3. Terminal Segment###
Leads to the cloaca and participates in sperm release during ejaculation.

###4. Seminal Glomus###
The **terminal enlargement** of the sperm duct that serves as the main **sperm storage organ**.  
Becomes swollen and gland-like during the breeding season.  
Releases sperm into the cloaca during copulation.

###Function###
Stores and transports **mature sperm** during the breeding season.  
Uses **muscular contractions** to expel sperm during ejaculation.  
Provides a pathway from the testes to the cloaca for sperm release.  
Acts as a **seasonal sperm reservoir**, maintaining sperm viability until mating occurs.

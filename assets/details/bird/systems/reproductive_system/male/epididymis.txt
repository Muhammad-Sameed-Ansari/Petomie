#Epididymis#

##Location##
Situated on the **dorsomedial surface** of each testis within the abdominal cavity.  
Connects the testis to the **vas deferens** via short efferent ducts.

###Shape###
A **small, flattened, and compact structure** consisting of short, coiled ducts.  
It is much smaller than in mammals but serves similar functions.

##Parts##

###1. Efferent Ducts###
Carry sperm from the seminiferous tubules into the epididymis.

###2. Epididymal Duct###
A single, coiled duct where **sperm concentration and maturation** occur.

###Function###
Collects sperm from the testes.  
Facilitates **maturation and temporary storage** of sperm.  
Transports sperm into the vas deferens for ejaculation.

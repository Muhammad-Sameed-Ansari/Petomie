#Testes#

##Location##
Located within the **abdominal cavity**, attached to the dorsal wall in front of the kidneys.  
They lie close to the lungs and the aorta, surrounded by connective tissue and fat.

###Shape###
**Oval or elongated organs**, pale in color and smooth in texture.  
Their size varies greatly depending on the breeding season — they enlarge during the reproductive period and shrink afterward.

##Parts##

###1. Seminiferous Tubules###
Highly coiled tubes responsible for **sperm production (spermatogenesis)**.

###2. Interstitial Cells (Leydig Cells)###
Located between the seminiferous tubules, producing **testosterone** for secondary sexual characteristics and behavior.

###3. Tunica Albuginea###
A thin connective tissue capsule enclosing and supporting the testes.

###Function###
Produce **spermatozoa** for reproduction.  
Secrete **testosterone**, regulating mating behavior and plumage.  
Change size seasonally based on reproductive activity.

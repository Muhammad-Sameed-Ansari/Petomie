#Seminal Glomus#

##Location##
Located at the **terminal end of the sperm duct**, just before it opens into the cloaca.  
Found on both sides of the body, running parallel to the ureters and closely associated with the cloacal wall.

###Shape###
A **coiled, gland-like enlargement** of the sperm duct.  
Its size and prominence vary seasonally, enlarging during the breeding season and regressing afterward.

##Parts##

###1. Muscular Wall###
Thickened smooth muscle tissue that contracts to release sperm during ejaculation.

###2. Glandular Epithelium###
Lined with columnar cells that help maintain sperm viability and moisture.

###3. Lumen###
The central cavity where **sperm are stored** prior to copulation.

###Function###
Serves as the **primary sperm storage organ** before ejaculation.  
Regulates sperm release during mating through muscular contractions.  
Maintains sperm temperature and viability until transfer to the female.  
Swells visibly during the breeding season as an indicator of reproductive readiness.

#Phallus (Penis Equivalent)#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral wall of the cloaca**, near the urodeum.  
Present only in certain bird species such as **ducks, geese, swans, and ratites**.  
Absent in most songbirds and parrots, which mate through cloacal contact.

###Shape###
A **spiral or tubular protrusion** formed from the cloacal wall.  
Erection occurs by **lymphatic engorgement**, not blood, as in mammals.

##Parts##

###1. Base###
Attached to the cloacal wall and supported by connective tissue.

###2. Body###
Contains **lymphatic spaces** that fill during erection to extend the phallus.

###3. Groove (Sulcus Spermaticus)###
A longitudinal groove along which sperm travels during copulation.

###Function###
Transfers **sperm directly into the female cloaca** during mating.  
Enables **successful fertilization** through intromission.  
Varies in size and form among bird species depending on mating behavior.

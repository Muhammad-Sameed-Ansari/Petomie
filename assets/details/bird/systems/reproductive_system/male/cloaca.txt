#Cloaca#

##Location##
Located at the **posterior end of the digestive and urogenital tracts**, opening externally as the vent.  
It serves as the **common chamber** for feces, urine, and reproductive materials.

###Shape###
A **muscular cavity** divided into three main regions, each serving different systems.  
It is lined with mucosa that changes slightly during the breeding season.

##Parts##

###1. Coprodeum###
The most anterior section that receives fecal matter from the intestines.

###2. Urodeum###
The middle chamber receiving sperm and urine from the vas deferens and ureters.

###3. Proctodeum###
The posterior section leading to the vent, through which all materials are expelled.

###Function###
Acts as a **shared exit** for the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems.  
Serves as the **ejaculatory outlet** for sperm during mating.  
In species without a phallus, facilitates **cloacal contact** for sperm transfer.

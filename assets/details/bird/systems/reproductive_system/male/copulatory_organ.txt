#Copulatory Organ#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral wall of the cloaca**, near the urodeum.  
Present only in certain bird species such as **ducks, geese, swans, and ratites**.  
Absent in most songbirds, parrots, and other perching birds, which mate via cloacal contact.

###Shape###
A **spiral or tubular protrusion** formed from the cloacal wall.  
Erection occurs through **lymphatic engorgement**, not blood as in mammals.  
When retracted, it lies folded within the cloaca.

##Parts##

###1. Base###
Anchored to the cloacal wall and supported by connective tissue.

###2. Body###
Composed of **lymphatic spaces** that fill to extend the organ during copulation.

###3. Groove (Sulcus Spermaticus)###
A narrow channel along which sperm travels from the cloaca into the female during mating.

###Function###
Acts as the **intromittent organ** in species that perform internal fertilization.  
Transfers sperm directly into the female’s cloaca during mating.  
Becomes erect through **lymphatic pressure** and retracts after copulation.  
Enhances reproductive success in species mating in aquatic or unstable environments.

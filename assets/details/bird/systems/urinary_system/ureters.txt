#Ureters#

##Location##
Two narrow ducts extending from the **caudal end of each kidney** to the **urodeum of the cloaca**.  
They run parallel to the ureters of the reproductive system (sperm duct or oviduct).

###Shape###
Thin, slightly curved tubes with muscular walls.  
Lined by a mucous epithelium resistant to uric acid crystals.  
Unlike mammals, they do not connect to a urinary bladder.

##Parts##
###1. Proximal Segment###
Arises from kidney lobes.  
**Function:** Collects urine (uric acid suspension) from renal tubules.

###2. Middle Segment###
Extends along dorsal body wall.  
**Function:** Transports urine via peristalsis.

###3. Terminal Segment###
Opens into urodeum of cloaca.  
**Function:** Directs urine into cloaca for excretion.

##Function##
- **Transport:** Moves uric acid and small volumes of water from kidneys to cloaca.  
- **No Storage:** Lacks bladder connection; excretion is continuous.  
- **Water Conservation:** Prevents backflow and limits water loss.  
- **Coordination:** Works with cloacal reflexes to control elimination timing.

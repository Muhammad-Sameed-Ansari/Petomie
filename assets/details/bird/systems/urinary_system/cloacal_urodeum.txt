#Urodeum (Cloacal Region)#

##Location##
The urodeum is the middle compartment of the bird’s cloaca, positioned between the coprodeum (digestive waste chamber) and the proctodeum (final exit chamber).  
It receives the ureters and reproductive ducts, acting as the central passage for urine and reproductive fluids.

###Shape###
A smooth-walled chamber with a rounded, softly folded interior designed to direct fluid flow efficiently.

###Parts###

##Ureteral Openings##
Entry points for urine from the kidneys.  
Energetically: symbolize **release, cleansing, and flow**.

##Reproductive Duct Openings##
Receive fluids from the reproductive tract.  
Energetically: represent **creation, transformation, and merging energies**.

##Sphincter Region##
Controls movement to the proctodeum.  
Energetically: embodies **boundaries and direction**.

###Function###
Collects urine, receives reproductive fluids, and directs them toward excretion.  
Plays a key role in moisture conservation, as most water is absorbed before waste reaches this chamber.  
Energetically, it governs **clearing, release, boundaries, and transitions**.

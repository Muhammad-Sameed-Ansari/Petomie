#Cloacal Urodeum#

##Location##
Middle compartment of the **cloaca**, situated between the coprodeum (anterior) and proctodeum (posterior).  
Serves as a shared passage for urinary and reproductive tracts.

###Shape###
Short, muscular chamber lined with mucosa and glandular tissue.  
Opens dorsally to receive **ureters** and ventrally to communicate with **coprodeum** and **proctodeum**.  
Wall is smooth and capable of limited expansion.

##Parts##
###1. Ureteral Openings###
Two small openings from the ureters on the dorsal wall.  
**Function:** Deliver urine (semi-solid uric acid) from kidneys.

###2. Genital Openings###
- **Males:** Openings of the sperm ducts.  
- **Females:** Opening of the oviduct.  
**Function:** Common passage for reproductive and urinary output.

###3. Cloacal Sphincter###
Circular muscle controlling cloacal release.  
**Function:** Coordinates timing of excretion with digestive system.

##Function##
- **Urine Reception:** Collects excretory material from ureters.  
- **Excretion Pathway:** Directs waste toward vent during defecation.  
- **Integration:** Combines urinary and reproductive outflow.  
- **Adaptation:** Prevents water loss by allowing partial reabsorption through cloacal wall.  

###Note###
In both sexes, the **urodeum** also serves as the **junction for reproductive tracts** —  
receiving the **sperm ducts in males** or the **oviduct in females**, before all contents exit through the vent.

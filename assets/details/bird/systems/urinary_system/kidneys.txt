#Kidneys#

##Location##
Paired organs located deep within the **synsacral cavity** of the pelvis, fitting into bony depressions on either side of the vertebral column.  
Each kidney lies along the dorsal wall of the body cavity, extending from the thoracic to the pelvic region.

###Shape###
Elongated and **three-lobed** (cranial, middle, and caudal lobes).  
Dark reddish-brown in color with a granular appearance due to dense vascularization.  
The kidneys are compact and fixed in position, unlike those of mammals.

##Parts##
###1. Renal Lobes###
Each kidney is divided into three lobes.  
**Function:** Independent filtration and excretion units.

###2. Nephrons###
Microscopic functional units, of two types:  
- **Cortical (reptilian type):** Lack loops of Henle; produce concentrated uric acid.  
- **Medullary (mammalian type):** Limited loops of Henle; assist water reabsorption.  
**Function:** Filter blood and regulate osmotic balance.

###3. Renal Portal System###
Unique vascular network that brings blood from the hindlimbs to the kidneys.  
**Function:** Allows dual blood supply for efficient filtration.

##Function##
- **Filtration:** Removes nitrogenous wastes from blood.  
- **Excretion:** Produces uric acid instead of urea, minimizing water loss.  
- **Osmoregulation:** Maintains ionic and fluid balance.  
- **Adaptation:** Supports water conservation for flight and arid habitats.

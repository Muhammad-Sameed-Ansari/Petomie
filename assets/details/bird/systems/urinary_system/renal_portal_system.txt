#Renal Portal System#

##Location##
The renal portal system is a specialized network of veins located in the hindquarters of birds.  
It collects blood from the legs, tail, and lower body and channels it toward the kidneys **before** it returns to the heart.

###Shape###
A branching venous system made of paired renal portal veins, tributaries from the hind limbs, and connections that pass through or around the kidneys.

###Parts###

##Renal Portal Veins##
Carry blood from the hind limbs directly toward the kidneys.  
Energetically: symbolize **flow, direction, and filtration**.

##Valve System##
Controls whether blood flows through the kidneys or bypasses them.  
Energetically: represents **choice, adaptability, and regulation**.

##Hind Limb Tributaries##
Veins collecting blood from the legs and tail region.  
Energetically: embody **support and grounding**.

##Kidney Capillary Network##
Where filtration may occur depending on valve position.  
Energetically: reflects **cleansing, refinement, and renewal**.

###Function###
Regulates blood flow through the kidneys, allowing birds to filter or redirect blood depending on hydration, stress, or metabolic needs.  
Helps maintain stable kidney pressure and supports efficient detoxification.  
Energetically, the renal portal system governs **adaptive flow, grounding, and deep energetic cleansing**.

#Veins#

The **bird’s veins** return deoxygenated blood back to the heart, completing the circulatory cycle.  
Their thin, flexible walls and valves ensure smooth, steady flow even during rapid movement or flight.  
Energetically, veins represent **return, reflection, and inner balance** — the inward movement of life force that restores and recalibrates.

###Parts###

###Function###
Veins return blood to the heart at low pressure, aided by valves and muscle movement.  
Energetically, they support **restoration, emotional return, and internal balance**.

###Common Imbalances###
Poor venous return: swelling or fatigue.  
Valve weakness: pooling or heaviness.  
Energetic stagnation: emotional heaviness or difficulty letting go.  
Energetic overload: internal pressure or overwhelm.

#Capillaries#

The **bird’s capillaries** are microscopic vessels where oxygen, nutrients, and waste products are exchanged between blood and tissues.  
Their network is incredibly dense, supporting the high metabolic demands of flight.  
Energetically, capillaries represent **connection, exchange, and intimate communication** between all parts of the system.

###Parts###

##Arterial Capillaries##
Receive high-oxygen blood from arterioles.  
Energetically, symbolize **activation and nourishment**.

##Venous Capillaries##
Pass deoxygenated blood to venules.  
Energetically, represent **release, completion, and transition**.

##Exchange Membrane##
The thin walls through which diffusion occurs.  
Energetically, embody **openness, sensitivity, and permeability**.

###Function###
Capillaries perform gas exchange, nutrient delivery, and waste removal—every cell depends on them.  
Energetically, they reflect **communication, flow, and interconnectedness**.

###Common Imbalances###
Reduced perfusion: cold tissues or fatigue.  
Capillary fragility: bruising or weakness.  
Energetic imbalance: difficulty connecting or exchanging energy with the environment.

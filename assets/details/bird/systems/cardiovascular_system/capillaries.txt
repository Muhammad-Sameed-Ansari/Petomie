#Capillaries#

##Location##
Microscopic vessels connecting arteries and veins throughout all tissues.  
Extremely dense in **flight muscles**, lungs, and brain.

###Shape###
Tiny, one-cell-thick tubes forming intricate networks.  
Walls consist of **endothelial cells** for rapid exchange.

##Parts##
###1. Pulmonary Capillaries###
Surround air capillaries in lungs.  
**Function:** Exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.

###2. Systemic Capillaries###
Spread through organs and muscles.  
**Function:** Deliver oxygen and nutrients, remove wastes.

###3. Hepatic Capillaries###
Located within the liver.  
**Function:** Filter and process absorbed nutrients.

###4. Renal Capillaries###
Located in the kidneys.  
**Function:** Assist in filtration and excretion.

##Function##
- **Exchange:** Transfer gases, nutrients, and waste.  
- **Efficiency:** Dense networks ensure rapid oxygen delivery.  
- **Temperature Control:** Adjust blood flow as needed.  
- **Metabolic Support:** Sustain tissue function during flight.

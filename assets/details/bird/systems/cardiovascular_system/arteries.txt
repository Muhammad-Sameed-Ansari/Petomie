#Arteries#

##Location##
Arteries extend throughout the body, originating from the **right aortic arch** and branching into major vessels that supply the head, wings, organs, and legs.

###Shape###
Thick-walled, elastic tubes that carry **oxygen-rich blood** under high pressure.  
Walls contain smooth muscle and elastic fibers for strength and flexibility.

##Parts##
###1. Aorta###
Main artery leaving the heart.  
**Function:** Distributes oxygenated blood to all body regions.

###2. Carotid Arteries###
Extend to the head and brain.  
**Function:** Supply oxygen and nutrients to the brain, eyes, and face.

###3. Subclavian Arteries###
Branch to the wings and thorax.  
**Function:** Deliver oxygenated blood to pectoral muscles and flight structures.

###4. Celiac and Mesenteric Arteries###
Originate from the aorta near the abdomen.  
**Function:** Supply digestive organs with oxygen and nutrients.

###5. Renal and Iliac Arteries###
Branch near the kidneys and pelvis.  
**Function:** Supply the kidneys and hindlimbs.

##Function##
- **Transport:** Carry oxygen and nutrients to tissues.  
- **Pressure Maintenance:** Sustain high pressure for efficient flow.  
- **Thermoregulation:** Adjust blood supply during flight.  
- **Flight Support:** Ensure oxygen delivery to muscles.

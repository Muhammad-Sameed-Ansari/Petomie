#Arteries#

The **bird’s arteries** form a high-pressure network that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to all organs, muscles, and feathers.  
Adapted for the intense metabolism required for flight, they are strong, elastic vessels built for efficiency and endurance.  
Energetically, the arteries represent **drive, direction, and outward flow** — the propulsion of life force that sustains vitality and movement.

###Parts###

##Aorta##
The largest artery, emerging from the left ventricle.  
Carries oxygen-rich blood to the entire body.  
Energetically, symbolizes **purpose, direction, and the main channel of life force**.

##Pulmonary Arteries##
Carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation.  
Energetically, represent **transformation and renewal**.

##Carotid Arteries##
Deliver blood to the head, brain, eyes, and sensory organs.  
Energetically, embody **clarity, awareness, and communication**.

##Coronary Arteries##
Supply the heart muscle itself.  
Energetically, reflect **self-sustenance, care, and inner nourishment**.

##Femoral, Iliac, and Brachial Arteries##
Transport blood to the wings and legs, enabling flight, perching, and locomotion.  
Energetically, represent **movement, flow, and empowered action**.

###Function###
Arteries transport oxygen-rich blood under high pressure, maintaining circulation, supporting organ function, and fueling flight.  
Energetically, they symbolize **vitality, expansion, and the active expression of life force**.

###Common Imbalances###
Constriction: reduced warmth or circulation.  
Inflammation: arterial strain or heat.  
Blockage: fatigue or poor oxygenation.  
Energetic blockage: fear of forward movement or resistance to flow.  
Energetic weakness: low drive or diminished vitality.  
Energetic overload: tension, pressure, or inner force imbalance.

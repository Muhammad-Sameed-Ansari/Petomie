#Bile Canaliculi#

Bile canaliculi are microscopic channels that run between hepatocytes inside the liver.  
They collect newly produced bile and guide it toward the bile duct system.  
Energetically, they represent subtle movement, inner flow, and the first step of release.

###Parts###

##Canalicular Network##  
A fine web of tiny channels connecting liver cells.  
Energetically, it reflects interconnectedness and gentle circulation.

##Canalicular Walls##  
Cell membranes that form the boundaries of each canaliculus.  
Energetically, they symbolize integrity and safe containment of flow.

###Function###  
Collect and transport bile from hepatocytes into larger bile ducts.  
Energetically, they initiate the process of cleansing and energetic release.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blockage: suppressed detoxification or emotional holding.  
Sluggish flow: fatigue, stagnation, or reduced vitality.  
Leakage: loss of energetic boundaries or overload.

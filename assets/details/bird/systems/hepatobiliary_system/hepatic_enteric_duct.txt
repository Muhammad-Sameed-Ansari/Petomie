#Hepatic Enteric Duct#

The hepatic enteric duct is a direct bile pathway from the liver to the intestine that is unique to birds.  
It allows bile to flow continuously into the digestive tract without being stored in a gallbladder.  
Energetically, it represents steady cleansing, uninterrupted flow, and constant renewal.

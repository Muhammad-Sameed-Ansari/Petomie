#Bile Ducts#

Bile ducts form the transport network that carries bile from the liver into the intestine.  
In birds, this system includes both a direct liver–intestine pathway and, in some species, a gallbladder pathway that merges before entering the duodenum.  
Energetically, bile ducts represent pathways of release, cleansing, and forward movement.

###Parts###

##Intrahepatic Bile Ducts##  
Small ducts inside the liver that collect bile from the canaliculi.  
Energetically, they reflect inner clearing and subtle detox flow.

##Hepatic Ducts##  
Ducts that carry bile out of the liver.  
Energetically, they symbolize outward movement and expression.

##Hepatic–Enteric Duct##  
A direct bile pathway from the liver to the intestine that is unique to birds.  
Energetically, it represents continuous cleansing and steady release.

##Terminal Bile Channel##  
The final segment where bile from all pathways enters the duodenum.  
Energetically, it reflects completion and final letting go.

###Function###  
Transport bile from the liver to the digestive tract to support fat digestion and toxin elimination.  
Energetically, they support flow, release, and energetic purification.

###Common Imbalances###  
Obstruction: resistance to letting go or internal stagnation.  
Spasm: tension or stress around release.  
Weak flow: sluggish detoxification and low vitality.

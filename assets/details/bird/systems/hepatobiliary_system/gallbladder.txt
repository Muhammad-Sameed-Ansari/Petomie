#Gallbladder#

The gallbladder is a small storage organ for bile in bird species that possess one.  
Many birds do not have a gallbladder and release bile continuously instead.  
Energetically, it represents timing, reserve, and the ability to hold and release at the right moment.

###Parts###

##Fundus##  
The main body where bile is stored.  
Energetically, it reflects reserve energy and holding capacity.

##Neck##  
The narrow exit leading to the cystic duct.  
Energetically, it symbolizes the decision to release.

##Gallbladder Wall##  
Muscular lining that contracts to release bile.  
Energetically, it represents control and responsiveness.

###Function###  
Stores and concentrates bile until it is needed for digestion.  
Energetically, it supports pacing, timing, and controlled release.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stagnation: rigidity or emotional holding.  
Overactivity: impulsive release or irritability.  
Inflammation: stress and internal tension.

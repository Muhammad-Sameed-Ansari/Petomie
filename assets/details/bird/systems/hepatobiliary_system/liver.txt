#Liver#

The liver is the central metabolic and detoxifying organ of the avian hepatobiliary system.  
It produces bile, filters the blood, and processes nutrients, hormones, and toxins.  
Energetically, it represents cleansing, emotional flow, adaptability, and the ability to transform what is taken in.

###Parts###

##Right Liver Lobe##  
The larger lobe that performs most metabolic and bile-producing activity.  
Energetically, it reflects active processing and outward transformation.

##Left Liver Lobe##  
The smaller balancing lobe that supports regulation and storage.  
Energetically, it represents inner harmony and stability.

##Hepatic Lobules##  
Microscopic structural units that organize liver tissue into functional zones.  
Energetically, they symbolize order within continuous change.

##Hepatocytes##  
Primary liver cells that produce bile, detoxify blood, and metabolize nutrients.  
Energetically, they represent cellular intelligence and energetic self-regulation.

##Kupffer Cells##  
Specialized immune cells that remove pathogens and debris from the blood.  
Energetically, they symbolize protection, discernment, and immune awareness.

##Hepatic Sinusoids##  
Wide blood channels that allow close contact between blood and liver cells.  
Energetically, they represent fluid exchange, circulation, and energetic flow.

##Portal Triads##  
Clusters containing a bile duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein branch.  
Energetically, they represent coordination between nourishment, cleansing, and circulation.

###Function###  
Filters blood, produces bile, processes nutrients, and neutralizes toxins.  
Energetically, it supports purification, emotional balance, and energetic clarity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Congestion: stagnation, unresolved emotion, or toxic overload.  
Inflammation: excessive stress or chemical burden.  
Weakness: reduced detoxification capacity or energetic fatigue.

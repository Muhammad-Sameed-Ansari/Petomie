#Cystic Duct#

The cystic duct connects the gallbladder to the bile duct system.  
It allows stored bile to move from the gallbladder into the main bile pathways.  
Energetically, it represents controlled release and the transition from holding to letting go.

###Parts###

##Cystic Duct Lumen##  
The hollow channel through which bile flows.  
Energetically, it reflects openness to release.

##Duct Wall##  
Muscular and elastic tissue that regulates bile flow.  
Energetically, it symbolizes balance between holding and releasing.

###Function###  
Carries bile from the gallbladder into the bile ducts.  
Energetically, it supports timing, coordination, and appropriate release.

###Common Imbalances###  
Blockage: suppressed expression or emotional holding.  
Spasm: fear of letting go.  
Weak tone: loss of regulation or exhaustion.

#Hepatic Lobules#

Hepatic lobules are the microscopic structural and functional units of the liver.  
They contain hepatocytes, sinusoids, bile canaliculi, and central veins arranged in an organized pattern.  
Energetically, they represent inner order, coordinated flow, and efficient transformation.

###Parts###

##Hepatocyte Plates##  
Rows of liver cells arranged around the central vein.  
Energetically, they symbolize organized cellular intelligence.

##Hepatic Sinusoids##  
Wide blood channels that run between hepatocyte plates.  
They allow blood to come into close contact with liver cells for detoxification and nutrient exchange.  
Energetically, they represent circulation, openness, and energetic exchange.

##Bile Canaliculi##  
Microscopic channels between hepatocytes that collect bile.  
Energetically, they reflect subtle movement and the beginning of release.

##Central Vein##  
The main vessel that collects filtered blood from the lobule.  
Energetically, it symbolizes completion and gathering.

###Function###  
Organize blood flow, bile movement, and cellular processing within the liver.  
Energetically, they support harmony, efficiency, and balanced energy flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Congestion: stagnation or overload.  
Disorganization: inefficient detoxification.  
Poor flow: reduced cellular communication.

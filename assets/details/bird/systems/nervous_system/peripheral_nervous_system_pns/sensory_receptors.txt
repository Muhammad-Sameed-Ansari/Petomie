#Sensory Receptors#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the **skin, feathers, muscles, eyes, ears, beak, and internal organs**.  
Concentrated in wings, head, and feet for flight and balance control.

###Shape###
Specialized nerve endings or sensory cells adapted to detect specific stimuli such as light, vibration, or pressure.

##Parts##
###1. Visual Receptors###
Located in the retina of the eye.  
**Function:** Detect light and color; provide acute vision for flight navigation.

###2. Auditory and Vestibular Receptors###
In the inner ear (cochlea and semicircular canals).  
**Function:** Detect sound and maintain balance and spatial orientation.

###3. Tactile Receptors###
In skin, beak, and tongue (Herbst and Grandry corpuscles).  
**Function:** Detect touch, vibration, and pressure during feeding and perching.

###4. Proprioceptors###
Within muscles and tendons.  
**Function:** Sense body and wing position for balance and flight control.

###5. Visceral Receptors###
Embedded in internal organs.  
**Function:** Monitor stretch, pressure, and chemical conditions.

##Function##
- **Sensory Detection:** Transmit information about environment and body state.  
- **Flight Adjustment:** Enable precise control of wing and tail movement.  
- **Balance Maintenance:** Integrate visual and vestibular input.  
- **Environmental Awareness:** Guide navigation, feeding, and communication.

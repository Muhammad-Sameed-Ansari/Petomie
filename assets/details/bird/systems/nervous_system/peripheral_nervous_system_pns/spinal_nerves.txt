#Spinal Nerves#

###Location###
Emerge in pairs from each segment of the **spinal cord**, passing through the intervertebral foramina of the vertebrae.  
Extend to wings, trunk, legs, and tail.

###Shape###
Paired **mixed nerves** (both sensory and motor) dividing into dorsal and ventral branches.  
Cervical and lumbosacral enlargements form major nerve plexuses.

###Parts###
##1. Cervical Nerves##
Arise from neck region.  
**Function:** Supply neck, wings, and forelimbs via the brachial plexus.

##2. Thoracic Nerves##
Run between ribs and body wall.  
**Function:** Control trunk muscles and skin sensation.

##3. Lumbosacral Nerves##
Emerge from fused synsacrum.  
**Function:** Supply hindlimbs and pelvic organs via the lumbosacral plexus.

##4. Caudal Nerves##
Extend toward tail.  
**Function:** Control tail feathers and cloacal reflexes.

###Function###
- **Motor Transmission:** Drives limb, trunk, and tail muscles.  
- **Sensory Transmission:** Carries input from skin and muscles.  
- **Integration:** Links CNS reflex centers to peripheral organs.  
- **Coordination:** Enables flight posture, walking, and perching responses.

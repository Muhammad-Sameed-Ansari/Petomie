#Peripheral Ganglia#

##Location##
Found along **spinal nerves** and **autonomic chains**, positioned outside the central nervous system.  
Located near vertebrae, internal organs, and major blood vessels.

###Shape###
Small, round or oval clusters of neuron cell bodies enclosed in connective tissue.  
Appear singly or in chains depending on type.

##Parts##
###1. Sensory (Dorsal Root) Ganglia###
Attached to spinal nerves.  
**Function:** Contain sensory neurons transmitting signals to the spinal cord.

###2. Autonomic Ganglia###
Linked with sympathetic or parasympathetic fibers.  
**Function:** Relay signals for involuntary organ control.

###3. Visceral Ganglia###
Found near or within organs.  
**Function:** Modulate local functions like gut motility or heart rate.

##Function##
- **Signal Relay:** Act as intermediate processing centers for nerve transmission.  
- **Reflex Coordination:** Support rapid responses without brain input.  
- **Integration:** Connect sensory and motor pathways in periphery.  
- **Adaptation:** Adjust organ activity to internal and external changes.

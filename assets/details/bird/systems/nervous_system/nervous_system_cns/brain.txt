#Brain#

##Location##
Enclosed within the **cranial cavity**, protected by skull bones and meninges.  
Occupies a large portion of the head, with prominent optic lobes and cerebellum adapted for flight coordination and vision.

###Shape###
Elongated and compact, with smooth hemispheres and highly developed midbrain regions.  
Lacks extensive cortical folding as in mammals, but dense neuron clusters support advanced sensory and motor integration.

##Parts##
###1. Forebrain (Prosencephalon)###
Composed of **cerebrum** and **diencephalon**.  
**Function:** Higher processing, learning, instinct, and hormonal control.
- **Cerebrum:** Controls voluntary movement, navigation, and memory.  
- **Diencephalon (Thalamus, Hypothalamus):** Relays sensory information and regulates temperature, hunger, and endocrine activity.

###2. Midbrain (Mesencephalon)###
Dominated by large **optic lobes**.  
**Function:** Processes vision and coordination between eyes and muscles.

###3. Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon)###
Includes **cerebellum**, **pons**, and **medulla oblongata**.  
**Function:** Maintains balance, flight coordination, respiration, and heartbeat control.
- **Cerebellum:** Fine-tunes balance and movement during flight.  
- **Medulla Oblongata:** Controls vital reflexes such as respiration and circulation.

###4. Pituitary Connection###
Located at brain base via infundibulum.  
**Function:** Links nervous and endocrine systems.

##Function##
- **Sensory Integration:** Receives and interprets visual, auditory, and vestibular signals.  
- **Motor Coordination:** Controls flight, walking, perching, and feeding.  
- **Autonomic Regulation:** Manages heart rate, temperature, and glandular activity.  
- **Cognition and Behavior:** Supports learning, vocalization, and spatial awareness.

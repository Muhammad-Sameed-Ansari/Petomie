#Brain Meninges and Cerebrospinal Fluid#

##Location##
Surround the **brain and spinal cord**, forming protective coverings within the cranial and vertebral cavities.

###Shape###
Three layered membranes enclosing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within subarachnoid spaces.  
Adapted for lightweight protection suitable for avian skulls.

##Parts##
###1. Dura Mater###
Tough outer fibrous layer attached to skull.  
**Function:** Provides mechanical protection and structure.

###2. Arachnoid Mater###
Middle thin membrane forming CSF-filled space.  
**Function:** Allows CSF circulation and shock absorption.

###3. Pia Mater###
Delicate inner layer adhering to brain and spinal surface.  
**Function:** Supplies blood vessels and nutrients to nervous tissue.

###4. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)###
Clear fluid circulating through ventricles and central canal.  
**Function:** Cushions brain, maintains pressure, and removes waste.

##Function##
- **Protection:** Absorbs shocks during flight and movement.  
- **Nutrition:** Delivers oxygen and nutrients to CNS tissue.  
- **Waste Removal:** Clears metabolites and supports ionic balance.  
- **Pressure Maintenance:** Keeps consistent intracranial environment.

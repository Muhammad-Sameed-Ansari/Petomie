#Spinal Cord#

##Location##
Extends from the **medulla oblongata** through the **vertebral canal** of the synsacrum, ending near the tail.  
Protected by vertebrae and meninges.

###Shape###
Elongated, cylindrical structure with **two enlargements**—cervical and lumbosacral—for wing and leg control.  
Central canal runs through its length carrying cerebrospinal fluid.

##Parts##
###1. Cervical Enlargement###
Located in the neck region.  
**Function:** Supplies nerves to wings and shoulder muscles.

###2. Lumbosacral Enlargement###
Found within the synsacral region.  
**Function:** Supplies hindlimbs and tail; integrates balance and walking.

###3. Gray Matter###
Central butterfly-shaped region.  
**Function:** Contains neuron cell bodies for reflexes and coordination.

###4. White Matter###
Surrounds gray matter.  
**Function:** Conducts ascending (sensory) and descending (motor) impulses.

###5. Central Canal###
Hollow core filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  
**Function:** Cushions and nourishes spinal tissue.

##Function##
- **Transmission:** Conducts nerve signals between brain and body.  
- **Reflex Control:** Mediates automatic postural and movement reflexes.  
- **Coordination:** Integrates input from limbs during flight or walking.  
- **Protection:** Encased in bone and meninges for mechanical safety.

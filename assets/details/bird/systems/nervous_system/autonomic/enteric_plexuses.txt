#Enteric Plexuses (Intrinsic Gut Nervous System)#

##Location##
Embedded in the **walls of the digestive tract** from the esophagus to the cloaca.  
Most prominent in the **gizzard, intestines, and cloacal region**.

###Shape###
Two main interconnected networks of nerve cells and fibers within the intestinal wall:  
- **Myenteric (Auerbach’s) Plexus** – between muscle layers  
- **Submucosal (Meissner’s) Plexus** – beneath mucosal lining

##Parts##
###1. Myenteric Plexus###
Located between circular and longitudinal muscle layers.  
**Function:** Controls peristaltic movements and gut motility.

###2. Submucosal Plexus###
Situated beneath mucosal lining.  
**Function:** Regulates secretion and local blood flow.

###3. Interneurons and Ganglia###
Small clusters linking local reflex arcs.  
**Function:** Coordinate digestion without central input.

##Function##
- **Autonomous Control:** Manages digestion independently of CNS.  
- **Peristalsis:** Generates rhythmic contractions for food propulsion.  
- **Secretion:** Controls mucus and enzyme release.  
- **Integration:** Communicates with vagus and sympathetic nerves for overall digestive harmony.

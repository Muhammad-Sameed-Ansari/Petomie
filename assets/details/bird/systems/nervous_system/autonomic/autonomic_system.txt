#Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)#

##Location##
Distributed throughout the body, connecting the **central nervous system** to internal organs such as the heart, lungs, digestive tract, and glands.  
Lies along the vertebral column and within visceral walls.

###Shape###
A network of **nerve chains, ganglia, and plexuses** extending from the neck to the cloacal region.  
Divided into **sympathetic**, **parasympathetic**, and **enteric** components.

##Parts##
###1. Sympathetic Division###
Arises from the thoracolumbar spinal cord and runs along the vertebral column.  
**Function:** Prepares the body for activity ("fight or flight").

###2. Parasympathetic Division###
Originates from cranial (especially vagus) and sacral regions.  
**Function:** Conserves energy and maintains normal bodily functions ("rest and digest").

###3. Enteric Division###
Embedded within digestive tract walls.  
**Function:** Controls intestinal motility and secretion independently.

##Function##
- **Involuntary Control:** Regulates heart rate, respiration, digestion, and pupil size.  
- **Coordination:** Maintains balance between excitation (sympathetic) and relaxation (parasympathetic).  
- **Adaptation:** Enables rapid physiological shifts between flight activity and resting states.  
- **Autonomy:** Supports vital organ function without conscious input.

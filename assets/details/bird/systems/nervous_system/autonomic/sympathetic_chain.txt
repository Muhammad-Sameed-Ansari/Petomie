#Sympathetic Chain#

##Location##
Runs along both sides of the **vertebral column**, extending from the neck to the cloacal region.  
Closely associated with spinal nerves and blood vessels.

###Shape###
A longitudinal chain of **ganglia** connected by interganglionic fibers.  
Prominent near the cervical, thoracic, and abdominal regions.

##Parts##
###1. Cervical Ganglia###
Include superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglia.  
**Function:** Supply head, neck, and heart with sympathetic fibers.

###2. Thoracic Ganglia###
Located near ribs and lungs.  
**Function:** Regulate heart rate, bronchodilation, and flight muscle blood flow.

###3. Abdominal Ganglia###
Distributed around kidneys and intestines.  
**Function:** Control vasoconstriction and glandular secretion.

###4. Interganglionic Fibers###
Connect ganglia in a continuous chain.  
**Function:** Coordinate signals along the trunk.

##Function##
- **Flight Response:** Increases heart rate and respiration.  
- **Circulation Control:** Diverts blood to muscles during activity.  
- **Thermoregulation:** Adjusts feather and skin blood flow.  
- **Coordination:** Synchronizes visceral organ responses to stress.

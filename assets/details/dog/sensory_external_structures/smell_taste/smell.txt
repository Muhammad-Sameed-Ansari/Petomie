#Smell – Olfactory Structures#

##Parts##
Nasal Cavity – Lined with specialized olfactory epithelium containing sensory cells.
Olfactory Epithelium – Tissue with millions of olfactory receptor neurons that detect odor molecules.
Olfactory Receptor Neurons – Nerve cells with cilia that bind to scent molecules.
Olfactory Bulb – Brain structure that processes scent signals received from receptor neurons.
Olfactory Nerve (Cranial Nerve I) – Transmits odor information from the nasal cavity to the brain.
Vomeronasal Organ (Jacobson’s Organ) – Accessory olfactory organ in the nasal septum detecting pheromones and social/chemical cues.
Turbinates (Nasal Conchae) – Scroll-like bones that increase surface area to filter, warm, and direct airflow toward olfactory receptors.

##Function##
Dogs have an exceptionally developed sense of smell, enabling them to detect tiny concentrations of scent molecules. Olfaction is critical for hunting, navigation, social communication, detecting danger, and forming emotional memory.

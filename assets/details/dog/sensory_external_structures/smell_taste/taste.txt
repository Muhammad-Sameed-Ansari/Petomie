#Taste – Gustatory Structures#

##Parts##
Tongue – Muscular organ covered in papillae, housing most of the taste buds.
Taste Buds – Clusters of gustatory receptor cells located on papillae that detect different flavors.
Gustatory Receptor Cells – Specialized cells that respond to tastants (chemicals in food).
Papillae Types – Fungiform, vallate, and foliate papillae contain taste buds; filiform papillae provide texture but no taste.
Facial Nerve (Cranial Nerve VII) – Transmits taste signals from the front two-thirds of the tongue.
Glossopharyngeal Nerve (Cranial Nerve IX) – Transmits taste signals from the back one-third of the tongue.
Vagus Nerve (Cranial Nerve X) – Transmits taste signals from the throat and epiglottis.

##Function##
Taste helps dogs evaluate food quality and safety, recognizing flavors such as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Though less developed than smell, taste works together with olfaction to guide dietary choices, detect spoiled food, and support survival.

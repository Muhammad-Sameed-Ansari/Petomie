#Touch – Proprioceptive Structures#

##Parts##
Muscle Spindles – Stretch receptors within muscles that detect changes in length and tension.
Golgi Tendon Organs – Receptors in tendons that sense muscle force and load.
Joint Receptors – Sensory endings in ligaments and joint capsules that detect position and movement.
Spinal Cord Pathways – Carry proprioceptive signals from body to brain.
Somatosensory Cortex – Brain region that processes tactile and proprioceptive input.

##Function##
Proprioception provides awareness of body position, balance, and movement coordination. It works with the tactile system to guide precise movements, posture control, and spatial orientation.

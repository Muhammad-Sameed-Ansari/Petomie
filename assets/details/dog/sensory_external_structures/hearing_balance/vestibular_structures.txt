#Vestibular Structures#

##Parts##
Semicircular Canals – Three fluid-filled loops in the inner ear that detect rotational head movements.
Vestibule (Utricle and Saccule) – Detect linear acceleration and head position relative to gravity.
Vestibular Nerve – Carries balance information from the inner ear to the brainstem.
Hair Cells (Mechanoreceptors) – Specialized sensory receptors within the vestibular system that detect movement of inner ear fluid.
Eustachian Tube – Connects middle ear to pharynx, equalizing air pressure on both sides of the tympanic membrane.

##Function##
Maintain balance, posture, and spatial orientation by detecting head position and movement. The vestibular system coordinates with eyes and muscles to stabilize vision and control body movement.

#Vestibular Structures#

##Parts##
###Semicircular Canals###
Three fluid-filled loops in the inner ear that detect rotational head movements.
###Vestibule (Utricle and Saccule)###
Detect linear acceleration and head position relative to gravity.
###Vestibular Nerve###
Carries balance information from the inner ear to the brainstem.
###Hair Cells (Mechanoreceptors)###
Specialized sensory receptors within the vestibular system that detect movement of inner ear fluid.
###Eustachian Tube###
Connects middle ear to pharynx, equalizing air pressure on both sides of the tympanic membrane.

##Function##
Maintain balance, posture, and spatial orientation by detecting head position and movement. The vestibular system coordinates with eyes and muscles to stabilize vision and control body movement.

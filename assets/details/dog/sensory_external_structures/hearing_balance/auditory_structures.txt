#Auditory Structures#

##Parts##
External Ear (Pinna/Auricle) – Funnel-shaped flap that collects and directs sound waves into the ear canal.
External Auditory Canal – Tubular passage leading to the eardrum; lined with glands producing protective cerumen (earwax).
Tympanic Membrane (Eardrum) – Thin membrane that vibrates in response to sound waves.
Ossicles (Malleus, Incus, Stapes) – Small bones in the middle ear that amplify and transmit vibrations to the inner ear.
Cochlea – Spiral, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear housing hair cells that convert sound vibrations into nerve signals.
Auditory (Cochlear) Nerve – Transmits auditory information from cochlea to the brain.

##Function##
Capture, amplify, and convert sound waves into electrical signals. These signals travel to the brain where they are interpreted as sound, allowing dogs to detect a wide range of frequencies and directional cues.

#Structures#

##Parts##
Cornea – Transparent, curved outer layer that refracts incoming light.
Sclera – Opaque, protective outer coat providing shape and support.
Iris – Colored muscular structure controlling pupil size.
Pupil – Central opening that regulates the amount of light entering.
Ciliary Body – Produces aqueous humor and adjusts lens curvature.
Lens – Transparent, elastic structure focusing light on the retina.
Retina – Light-sensitive tissue containing photoreceptors (rods and cones).
Optic Nerve – Transmits visual signals from retina to the brain.

##Function##
Capture and focus light onto the retina, regulate light entry, and convert light into electrical signals for processing in the brain.

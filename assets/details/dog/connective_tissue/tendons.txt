#Tendons#

##Location##
Tendons are strong, flexible bands of connective tissue that connect muscles to bones throughout the dog’s body.
They are found everywhere a muscle attaches to a bone — especially in the legs, shoulders, and paws — and help transmit muscle power to create movement.

##Shape##
They are smooth, shiny cords or flat sheets made mostly of collagen fibers.
Tendons are tough but slightly elastic, which helps absorb shock and allow smooth, coordinated motion.

##Parts##

###1. Achilles (Calcaneal) Tendon###

Found at the back of the hind leg, from the calf muscles to the point of the hock.

Function: Extends the hock joint and helps the dog jump, run, and push off the ground.

###2. Common Digital Extensor Tendon###

Runs along the front of the forelimb and hindlimb.

Function: Straightens (extends) the toes and foot during walking and running.

###3. Deep Digital Flexor Tendon###

Lies deep within the limb, attaching to the toes.

Function: Bends (flexes) the toes and helps grip surfaces.

###4. Superficial Digital Flexor Tendon###

Found above the deep flexor tendon.

Function: Bends the lower joints of the leg and supports the paw during movement.

###5. Biceps Tendon###

Found in the front of the shoulder joint.

Function: Stabilizes the shoulder and flexes the elbow.

###6. Triceps Tendon###

Located at the back of the upper forelimb, inserting into the elbow.

Function: Extends the elbow joint.

###7. Quadriceps Tendon###

Found at the front of the thigh, above the kneecap.

Function: Straightens the hind leg by extending the stifle (knee) joint.

###8. Patellar Tendon###

Connects the kneecap (patella) to the tibia.

Function: Works with the quadriceps tendon to extend and stabilize the leg.

###9. Long Digital Extensor Tendon###

Runs from the upper hind leg to the toes.

Function: Extends the toes and aids in forward movement.

###10. Lateral Digital Extensor Tendon###

Along the outer side of the limb.

Function: Assists in extending and stabilizing the toes and paw.

##Function##

Movement: Transmit force from muscles to bones to produce motion.

Support: Stabilize joints during running, jumping, and standing.

Shock absorption: Reduce stress on muscles and joints during activity.

Energy storage: Act like springs, storing and releasing energy during stride.

Protection: Prevent overextension and help maintain balance.

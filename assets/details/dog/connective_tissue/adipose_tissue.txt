#Adipose Tissue#

##Location##
Adipose tissue is fat-storing connective tissue found beneath the skin, around internal organs, between muscles, and inside bone marrow.
It is especially visible in areas like the abdomen, chest, neck, and around the kidneys.
There are two main types in dogs — white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue.

##Shape##
It appears as soft, spongy, yellowish tissue made of round fat cells (adipocytes).
These cells store energy as fat and are surrounded by blood vessels and connective fibers.
The amount and thickness depend on the dog’s diet, activity, and temperature regulation needs.

##Parts (Types of Adipose Tissue)##

###1. White Adipose Tissue###

The main fat tissue in adult dogs.

Found under the skin (subcutaneous fat), around organs, and in the abdominal cavity.

Function: Stores extra energy, cushions organs, and helps control body temperature.

###2. Brown Adipose Tissue###

Found mostly in young dogs or puppies, around the shoulders, spine, and neck.

Function: Generates body heat by burning fat, keeping puppies warm before they can regulate temperature on their own.

###3. Subcutaneous Fat###

Found directly beneath the skin.

Function: Provides insulation, stores energy, and maintains body shape.

###4. Visceral Fat###

Found deeper inside the body, around organs such as the liver and kidneys.

Function: Protects organs from impact and supports internal cushioning.

##Function##

Energy storage: Stores calories from food for later use.

Protection: Cushions and shields organs, muscles, and joints from injury.

Insulation: Keeps body temperature stable by reducing heat loss.

Metabolism: Releases hormones and signals that regulate appetite and energy use.

Healing and repair: Provides energy for recovery and tissue regeneration.

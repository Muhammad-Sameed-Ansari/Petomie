#Fascia#

##Location##
Fascia is a thin, stretchy layer of connective tissue found throughout the entire body.
It lies under the skin, around muscles, between organs, and even surrounds nerves and blood vessels.
In dogs, fascia helps hold everything in place while still allowing smooth movement.

##Shape##
It looks like a shiny, web-like sheet that can be thin or thick depending on the body part.
There are several layers that connect to each other, forming one continuous system from head to tail.

##Parts##

###1. Superficial Fascia###

Found right under the skin.

Function: Connects the skin to muscles and lets it move freely; stores fat and helps with insulation.

###2. Deep Fascia###

Surrounds and separates muscles and groups of muscles.

Function: Keeps muscles in their proper place, helps transmit movement, and reduces friction.

###3. Visceral (Internal) Fascia###

Surrounds organs like the heart, lungs, and digestive organs.

Function: Holds organs in position and allows them to move smoothly during breathing or digestion.

###4. Fascial Planes###

Thin spaces between layers of fascia.

Function: Allow nerves, blood vessels, and lymph to pass easily through the body.

##Function##

Support: Holds muscles, bones, and organs in their correct position.

Movement: Allows muscles to slide smoothly and work together.

Protection: Cushions and supports delicate structures.

Connection: Links all body parts together into one continuous network.

Healing: Plays a role in tissue repair and inflammation control.

#Ulna#

##Location##
Located on the caudal (posterior) side of the forearm, parallel to the radius.
Extends from the elbow joint to the carpus, forming part of the antebrachium.
In dogs, the ulna remains a complete and separate bone (unlike in horses, where it is fused with the radius).

##Shape##
A long, slender bone with three main parts:
Proximal end: forms the olecranon process, the bony prominence of the elbow, providing attachment for the triceps muscle.
Shaft: narrower middle portion running parallel and slightly caudal to the radius.
Distal end: forms the styloid process, articulating with the ulnar carpal bone and the radius.

##Function##
Forms the elbow joint together with the humerus and radius, allowing flexion and extension of the forelimb.
Serves as an attachment site for muscles controlling elbow and paw movement.
Provides stability to the forearm and contributes to pronation and supination (rotational movements) — functions that are more pronounced in dogs than in horses.
Acts as a lever for powerful extension of the elbow via the triceps muscle.

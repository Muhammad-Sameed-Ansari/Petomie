#Scapula#

##Location##  
The scapula forms the **shoulder blade**, located on the lateral side of the thorax.  
It connects the forelimb to the trunk through muscular attachments rather than a bony joint.  
It lies between the second and seventh ribs, providing a wide surface for muscle connection.

###Shape###  
A **flat, triangular bone** with a prominent spine dividing its surface into two regions — supraspinous and infraspinous fossae.  
The distal end bears the glenoid cavity, which articulates with the humerus to form the shoulder joint.

###Parts###

#Blood#

##Location##
Blood flows through the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries, reaching every part of the dog’s body.
It delivers oxygen, nutrients, and hormones, and removes carbon dioxide and waste products.

##Shape##
Blood is a red fluid tissue made of cells suspended in plasma (a clear liquid).
It’s slightly thicker than water and has a metallic scent due to iron in the red blood cells.

##Parts##

###1. Plasma###

The liquid portion of blood.

Function: Carries nutrients, hormones, proteins, and waste through the body.

###2. Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)###

Round cells filled with hemoglobin.

Function: Transport oxygen from lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide back to the lungs.

###3. White Blood Cells (Leukocytes)###

Immune system cells.

Function: Protect the body by fighting infection and removing harmful substances.

###4. Platelets (Thrombocytes)###

Tiny cell fragments in the blood.

Function: Help the blood clot and repair damaged vessels.

###5. Capillaries###

Tiny blood vessels connecting arteries and veins.

Function: Allow oxygen and nutrients to move into tissues and collect waste products.

###6. Arteries###

Strong, thick vessels carrying blood away from the heart.

Function: Deliver oxygen-rich blood to tissues.

###7. Veins###

Thin-walled vessels carrying blood back to the heart.

Function: Return oxygen-poor blood to the lungs for re-oxygenation.

##Function##

Transport: Moves oxygen, nutrients, and hormones throughout the body.

Protection: White blood cells defend against infection.

Healing: Platelets seal wounds to prevent blood loss.

Regulation: Maintains body temperature and pH balance.

Waste removal: Carries toxins and carbon dioxide to organs for elimination

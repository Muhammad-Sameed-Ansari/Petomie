#Cartilage#

In dogs, cartilage is a flexible connective tissue that cushions joints, supports ears and nose, and allows smooth motion.  
It prevents friction and absorbs shock.  
Energetically, it represents **flexibility, adaptability, and harmony**.

###Parts###

##Hyaline Cartilage##  
Lines joint surfaces for smooth movement.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **flow and ease**.

##Elastic Cartilage##  
Shapes the ears and parts of the larynx, giving flexibility.  
Energetically, it reflects **adaptability and openness**.

##Fibrocartilage##  
Provides firm cushioning in intervertebral discs.  
Energetically, it embodies **grounded strength and stability**.

###Function###  
Cartilage maintains joint integrity, allows painless motion, and supports body form.  
Energetically, it governs **balance between strength and flexibility**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness: fear of movement or resistance.

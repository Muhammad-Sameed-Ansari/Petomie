#Cartilage#

##Location##
Cartilage is a smooth, flexible connective tissue found in many parts of the dog’s body.
It is located in the joints, ears, nose, rib cage, larynx, and trachea.
It helps cushion movement, shape body structures, and protect bones from friction.

##Shape##
Cartilage is firm yet slightly bendable, appearing as a white or bluish, shiny material.
It does not contain blood vessels — it gets nutrients through nearby tissues, which makes healing slower than in other body parts.

##Parts (Types of Cartilage)##

###1. Hyaline Cartilage###

The most common type.

Found in joints (articular cartilage), ribs, nose, and trachea.

Function: Provides smooth movement at joints and supports flexible structures like the nose and windpipe.

###2. Elastic Cartilage###

Found in the ears, epiglottis, and some parts of the larynx.

Function: Gives shape and flexibility to body parts that need to bend and return to position.

###3. Fibrocartilage###

Found in intervertebral discs, menisci of the stifle (knee), and around tendons.

Function: Acts as a shock absorber and provides strong support where pressure is high.

##Function##

Cushioning: Reduces friction between bones in joints.

Support: Maintains structure in flexible areas like the ears and nose.

Shock absorption: Protects joints and spine during running and jumping.

Movement: Allows smooth, pain-free motion in the limbs and back.

Protection: Shields bones and prevents wear in high-movement areas.

#Ligaments#

##Location##
Ligaments are strong, flexible bands of connective tissue that connect bones to other bones throughout the dog’s body.
They are found in every joint — such as the shoulder, knee (stifle), elbow, and spine — and are essential for stability and controlled movement.

##Shape##
They are dense, fibrous cords or sheets made mostly of collagen.
While similar to tendons, ligaments connect bone to bone (not muscle to bone) and are slightly less elastic, keeping joints stable while still allowing natural motion.

##Parts##

###1. Cruciate Ligaments (Cranial & Caudal)###

Found inside the stifle (knee) joint.

Function: Prevent forward and backward sliding of the tibia under the femur and stabilize the knee.

Note: The cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) is one of the most commonly injured in dogs.

###2. Collateral Ligaments###

Located on either side of most joints, including the stifle, elbow, and hock.

Function: Prevent excessive side-to-side movement and provide joint stability.

###3. Patellar Ligament###

Extends from the kneecap (patella) to the tibia.

Function: Aids in extending the leg and helps keep the kneecap in position.

###4. Nuchal Ligament###

Runs along the top of the neck, connecting the skull to the upper back.

Function: Supports the head and reduces muscle effort when holding it upright.

###5. Supraspinous Ligament###

Continues from the nuchal ligament down the spine.

Function: Stabilizes and supports the back during movement.

###6. Dorsal & Ventral Longitudinal Ligaments###

Run along the spine, attaching vertebrae together.

Function: Keep the spine aligned and protect the spinal cord.

###7. Intervertebral Ligaments###

Found between vertebrae.

Function: Allow flexibility and cushion spinal movement.

###8. Annular Ligaments###

Found around certain joints, like the carpus (wrist).

Function: Hold tendons close to the bones and guide smooth movement.

###9. Plantar & Palmar Ligaments###

Located on the underside of the paws and limbs.

Function: Support joints and prevent overextension when walking or running.

###10. Sacrotuberous Ligament###

Connects the pelvis to the femur region.

Function: Supports the hind limb and stabilizes the pelvis.

##Function##

Stabilization: Keep joints in proper alignment during movement.

Support: Prevent overextension and injury during activity.

Flexibility: Allow limited, controlled motion between bones.

Shock absorption: Help cushion joints during running or jumping.

Protection: Maintain joint integrity and reduce wear on cartilage.

#Ligaments - Hindlimb#

##Location##
Stifle, hock, digits, pelvis.

##Shape##
Dense fibrous cords, some broad (collateral) and some short and strong (cruciate).

##Parts##
Patellar Ligament – Connects patella to tibial tuberosity.
Collateral Ligaments of Stifle – Medial and lateral; stabilize joint.
Cruciate Ligaments (Cranial & Caudal) – Inside stifle; prevent tibial displacement.
Meniscal Ligaments – Anchor menisci.
Collateral Ligaments of Hock – Medial and lateral; stabilize hock.
Plantar Ligaments – Resist hyperextension of hock.
Collateral Ligaments of Digits – Stabilize toe joints.
Sacrotuberous Ligament – From sacrum to ischiatic tuberosity; stabilizes pelvis.

##Function##
Stabilize hindlimb joints, resist abnormal motion, allow efficient propulsion.

#Lymph#

##Location##
Lymph is a clear fluid that moves through a network of lymph vessels, nodes, and ducts across the body.
It flows through the lymphatic system, which runs alongside blood vessels.
Major lymph nodes are found in the neck, chest, armpits, groin, and behind the knees.

##Shape##
Lymph is a transparent or slightly yellow fluid made of water, proteins, and immune cells (especially lymphocytes).
It travels slowly through thin vessels with valves that keep it moving in one direction — toward the heart.

##Parts##

###1. Lymph Fluid###

Clear, watery fluid collected from tissues.

Function: Removes waste, toxins, and excess fluid from tissues.

###2. Lymph Nodes###

Small, bean-shaped filters found throughout the body.

Function: Trap and destroy bacteria, viruses, and abnormal cells.

###3. Lymph Vessels###

Thin tubes similar to veins.

Function: Carry lymph fluid back to the bloodstream.

###4. Lymphocytes###

White blood cells (B and T cells).

Function: Identify and destroy infections and help the immune system remember threats.

###5. Spleen###

Located in the upper abdomen.

Function: Filters blood, removes damaged cells, and stores white blood cells.

###6. Thymus###

Small gland in the chest, larger in young dogs.

Function: Helps develop T cells (immune defense cells).

###7. Tonsils###

Found at the back of the throat.

Function: Trap germs entering through the mouth or nose.

##Function##

Immune defense: Protects the body against infections and diseases.

Filtration: Cleans fluids before they return to the bloodstream.

Fluid balance: Removes extra fluid from tissues and prevents swelling.

Waste removal: Helps clear out bacteria, cell debris, and toxins.

Transport: Moves immune cells throughout the body.

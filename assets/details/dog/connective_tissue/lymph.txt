#Lymph#

##Location##
Flows through the lymphatic system: lymphatic capillaries, vessels, nodes, and ducts, returning to venous circulation.

##Shape##
Clear to slightly yellow fluid, lower in proteins than plasma, rich in lymphocytes.

##Parts##
Lymphatic Capillaries – Collect interstitial fluid from tissues.
Lymph Vessels – Transport lymph back toward the thoracic duct and venous system.
Lymph Nodes – Filter lymph, produce lymphocytes, mount immune responses.
Lymph Organs – Spleen, thymus, tonsils, Peyer’s patches.
Thoracic Duct & Right Lymphatic Duct – Return lymph to venous circulation.

##Function##
Maintain fluid balance by returning interstitial fluid to the blood.
Transport lipids absorbed from the intestine.
Provide immune surveillance and defense.
Filter pathogens and present them to lymphocytes.

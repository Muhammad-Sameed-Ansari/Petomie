#Sebaceous Glands#

##Location##
Sebaceous glands are located throughout the dog’s skin, most abundantly around the face, back, tail base, and paws.
They open into hair follicles, where they release their oily secretion.

###Shape###
Tiny sac-like glands clustered around hair roots, filled with cells that produce oil (sebum).

##Function##
Produce sebum, a natural oil that keeps the skin and coat soft, shiny, and slightly waterproof.
Help protect against bacteria, dryness, and cracking.
Contribute to the dog’s natural scent used for communication and territory marking.

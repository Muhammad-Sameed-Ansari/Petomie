#Eccrine Glands#

##Location##
Eccrine glands in dogs are found only in paw pads and nose leather (the moist part of the nose).
They open directly onto the surface of the skin.

###Shape###
Tiny coiled glands embedded deep within the paw pads and nasal tissue.

##Function##
Produce watery sweat that helps cool the body and increase traction on smooth surfaces.
Keep the nose moist, enhancing the sense of smell.
Help the dog leave scent traces on the ground when walking.

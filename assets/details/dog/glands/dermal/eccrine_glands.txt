#Eccrine Glands#

The dog’s eccrine glands are true sweat glands found mainly on the paw pads and the nose.  
They help provide traction and assist in scent signaling.  
Energetically, they represent grounding, awareness, and sensitivity to the environment.

###Parts###

##Paw Pad Glands##  
Located in the pads of the feet, secreting moisture that improves grip.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding, stability, and connection to the earth.

##Nasal Glands##  
Found in the nose, helping keep the surface moist for scent detection.  
Energetically, they reflect intuition, alertness, and clear perception.

##Duct Openings##  
Tiny pores that release watery sweat onto skin surfaces.  
Energetically, they represent openness and adaptability to environmental change.

###Function###  
Eccrine glands aid in traction, temperature moderation, and scent marking.  
They also maintain nasal moisture for sharp olfactory performance.  
Energetically, they promote grounded awareness and sensory balance.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dry pads: dehydration or overactivity.  
Over-sweating: nervous energy or stress.  
Cracked pads: disconnection from grounding or environmental imbalance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect restlessness or a need for reconnection with stability.

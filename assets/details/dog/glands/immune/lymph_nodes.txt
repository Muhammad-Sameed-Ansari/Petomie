#Lymph Nodes (Lymph Glands)#

The dog’s lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped glands distributed throughout the body.  
They filter lymph fluid and support the immune system’s defense.  
Energetically, they represent purification, discernment, and energetic boundaries.

Located in the neck, armpits, and groin.  
Energetically, they symbolize awareness and external balance.

##Deep Nodes##  
Surround internal organs and large blood vessels.  
Energetically, they reflect deep stability and protection.

##Lymphatic Channels##

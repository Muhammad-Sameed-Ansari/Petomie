#Lymph Glands (Lymph Nodes)#

The dog’s lymph glands, or lymph nodes, are small immune glands located throughout the body.  
They filter lymph fluid, trapping pathogens and supporting immune defense.  
Energetically, they represent purification, discernment, and protection.

###Parts###

##Superficial Nodes##  
Located beneath the skin around the neck, armpits, and groin.  
Energetically, they symbolize external awareness and connection.

##Deep Nodes##  
Situated along internal organs and blood vessels.  
Energetically, they represent inner strength and resilience.

##Lymphatic Vessels##  
Transport fluid between nodes.  
Energetically, they reflect flow, cleansing, and release.

###Function###  
Lymph glands purify lymph, produce immune cells, and protect the body from infection.  
Energetically, they maintain clarity, cleansing, and balanced defense against negativity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: immune activation or stress.  
Tenderness: detoxification or tension.  
Blockage: stagnation or unresolved emotion.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect overwhelm, lack of release, or holding onto others’ energy.

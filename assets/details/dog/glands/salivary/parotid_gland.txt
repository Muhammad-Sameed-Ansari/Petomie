#Parotid Glands#

The dog’s parotid glands are the largest salivary glands, located below the ears on each side of the face.  
They secrete a watery saliva rich in enzymes that begin digestion and keep the mouth clean.  
Energetically, they represent clarity, joy, and expression through communication.

###Parts###

Energetically, they embody enthusiasm and creative flow.

##Parotid Duct (Stensen’s Duct)##  
Carries saliva forward to open near the upper premolars.  
Energetically, it symbolizes release, verbal flow, and emotional cleansing.

##Surrounding Fascia##

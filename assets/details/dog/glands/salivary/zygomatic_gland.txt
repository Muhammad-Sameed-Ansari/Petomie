#Zygomatic Glands#

The dog’s zygomatic glands are unique to carnivores and lie deep behind the upper jaw near the last molars.  
They secrete saliva to lubricate and protect the back of the mouth during chewing.  
Energetically, they represent perception, awareness, and connection between seeing and speaking truth.

###Parts###

##Gland Body##  
Flattened lobes beneath the zygomatic arch inside the orbit of the eye.  
Energetically, they symbolize inner observation and thoughtful clarity.

##Zygomatic Ducts##  
Small openings near the molars that release saliva into the mouth.  
Energetically, they reflect the flow between insight and expression.

##Connective Support##  
Fibrous layer anchoring the gland behind the upper jaw.  
Energetically, it represents stability, focus, and grounded awareness.

###Function###  
Zygomatic glands moisten the mouth’s rear region, ease chewing, and support oral comfort.  
They contribute to taste, protection, and smooth swallowing.  
Energetically, they promote mindful communication and harmony between intuition and speech.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: unspoken truth or emotional overload.  
Inflammation: irritation from repressed perception.  
Blockage: conflict between awareness and expression.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect seeing too much without release or holding back insight.

#Mandibular Glands#

The dog’s mandibular glands are paired salivary glands located beneath the lower jaw.  
They produce a mix of watery and mucous saliva that lubricates food, protects oral tissues, and assists swallowing.  
Energetically, they represent balance, communication, and grounded emotional flow.

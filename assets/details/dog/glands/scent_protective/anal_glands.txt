#Anal Glands#

The dog’s anal glands, also called anal sacs, are paired scent glands located on either side of the anus at approximately the four and eight o’clock positions.  
They produce a strong-smelling secretion used for marking territory and communication.  
Energetically, they represent boundaries, grounding, and the release of suppressed tension.

###Parts###

##Right and Left Sacs##  
Small oval pouches beneath the skin beside the anus.  
Energetically, they symbolize dual aspects of expression and protection.

##Ducts##  
Tiny openings that allow secretion to pass into the anal canal.  
Energetically, they represent release and energetic clearing.

##Glandular Lining##  
Secretory cells producing an oily, musky fluid unique to each individual.  
Energetically, it reflects authenticity and self-identification.

###Function###  
Anal glands secrete scent material used in social communication and territory marking.  
They also play a role in lubricating stool passage.  
Energetically, they help ground instinctive energy and establish healthy energetic boundaries.

###Common Imbalances###  
Impaction: holding on to emotions or stress.  
Infection or abscess: irritation, fear, or repressed aggression.  
Over-secretion: anxiety or overstimulation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty asserting oneself or releasing built-up tension.

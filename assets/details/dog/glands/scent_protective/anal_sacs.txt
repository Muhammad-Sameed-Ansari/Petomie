#Anal Sacs#

In dogs, the anal sacs are two small glands located on either side of the anus beneath the skin.  
They secrete a strong-smelling fluid used for scent marking, recognition, and emotional communication.  
Energetically, they represent **release, boundaries, and self-expression**.

###Parts###

##Left Anal Sac##  
Positioned around the 4 o’clock side of the anus.  
Stores and releases scent material when pressure is applied during defecation or stress.  
Energetically, it symbolizes **expression of identity and emotional release**.

##Right Anal Sac##  
Located around the 8 o’clock side of the anus.  
Works together with the left gland for marking and balance.  
Energetically, it reflects **stability, balance, and controlled release**.

##Ducts##  
Tiny channels leading from each sac to the anus, allowing secretion to exit.  
Energetically, they represent **clear pathways for emotional flow and release**.

###Function###  
The anal sacs produce pheromones for communication, marking territory, and expressing emotional state.  
They help dogs identify one another and convey subtle energetic messages.  
Energetically, they govern **healthy release, personal boundaries, and recognition of self**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Impaction: emotional holding or fear of expression.  
Infection: irritation due to stress or boundary invasion.  
Leakage or overactivity: anxiety or overstimulation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **difficulty letting go, fear of exposure, or loss of energetic boundaries**.

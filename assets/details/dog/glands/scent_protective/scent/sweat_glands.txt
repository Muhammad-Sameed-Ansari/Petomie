#Sweat Glands#

The dog’s sweat glands are primarily apocrine glands distributed across most of the skin.  
They play a minor role in thermoregulation but a major role in scent communication.  
Energetically, sweat glands represent **release, expression, and subtle emotional signaling**.

###Parts###

##Apocrine Secretory Cells##  
Produce sweat with scent molecules.  
Energetically symbolize **communication, release, and emotional presence**.

##Sweat Ducts##  
Transport sweat to the surface.  
Energetically reflect **movement, expression, and energetic clearing**.

##Skin Surface Pores##  
Allow sweat to exit the body.  
Energetically represent **openness, freedom, and expression**.

###Function###  
Assist in scent communication, mild cooling, and waste release.  
Energetically support **letting go, expressing emotion, and restoring balance**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess odor: energetically linked to **stress, tension, or emotional heaviness**.  
Reduced secretion: tied to **stagnation or suppressed expression**.

#Sebaceous Glands#

The dog’s sebaceous glands are oil-producing glands found throughout the skin, closely associated with hair follicles.  
They secrete sebum to protect, waterproof, and condition the coat.  
Energetically, they represent **self-protection, identity, and healthy boundaries**.

###Parts###

##Sebocytes##  
Cells that produce and release sebum.  
Energetically symbolize **nourishment, comfort, and self-support**.

##Follicle Duct##  
Carries sebum to the skin surface.  
Energetically represents **flow, expression, and clarity in identity**.

##Glandular Capsule##  
Connective tissue supporting the gland.  
Energetically reflects **structure, containment, and grounded presence**.

###Function###  
Lubricates skin and coat, prevents dryness, and creates a microbial barrier.  
Energetically maintains **self-worth, ease, and balanced boundaries**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overproduction: oily coat, acne — energetically tied to **overwhelm or blurred boundaries**.  
Underproduction: dryness, dull coat — linked to **depletion or lack of self-nourishment**.

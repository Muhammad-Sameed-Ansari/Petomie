#Ceruminous Glands#

The dog’s ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands in the ear canal.  
They produce earwax that traps dust, repels water, and prevents infection.  
Energetically, they represent listening, intuition, and inner clarity.

###Parts###

##Sebaceous Components##  
Mix with earwax to maintain moisture.  
Energetically, they symbolize comfort and flexibility.

##Apocrine Units##  
Produce wax and antimicrobial substances.  
Energetically, they represent discernment and protection.

##Ear Canal Lining##  
Guides wax outward for cleansing.  
Energetically, it reflects openness and awareness.

###Function###  
Ceruminous glands protect the ear canal by maintaining hygiene and moisture balance.  
Energetically, they support listening — to both outer guidance and inner truth.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess wax: overstimulation or emotional overload.  
Dryness: avoidance or disconnection.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect refusal to listen or blocked intuition.

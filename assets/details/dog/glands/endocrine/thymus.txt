#Thymus#

The dog’s thymus is a soft, lobed gland located in the upper chest, just in front of the heart.  
It plays a crucial role in early life by developing and training immune cells, especially T-lymphocytes.  
Energetically, it represents vitality, protection, courage, and the heart-centered foundation of immunity.

###Parts###

##Cortex##  
The outer region where immature immune cells develop.  
Energetically, it symbolizes growth, strengthening boundaries, and building inner resilience.

##Medulla##  
The inner region where T-cells mature into functional immune defenders.  
Energetically, it represents clarity, purpose, and refined protective force.

##Thymic Lobules##  
Small organized compartments that guide immune development.  
Energetically, they reflect structure, guidance, and inner harmony.

###Function###  
The thymus trains T-cells, develops core immunity, and protects young dogs during their most vulnerable stages.  
It supports long-term immune memory, resilience, and defense against infections.  
Energetically, it strengthens courage, emotional steadiness, and balanced responsiveness to stress.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakened immunity: frequent illness or slow recovery.  
Underdevelopment in puppies: reduced immune strength.  
Age-related atrophy: natural shrinking that decreases T-cell production.  
Energetically, imbalance may show as insecurity, emotional sensitivity, difficulty adapting, or weakened boundaries.

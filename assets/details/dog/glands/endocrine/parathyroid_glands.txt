#Parathyroid Glands#

The dog’s parathyroid glands are four small nodules located on the surface of the thyroid gland.  
They regulate calcium and phosphorus balance in the body.  
Energetically, they represent structure, stability, and self-support.

###Parts###

##Chief Cells##  
Secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) to increase calcium levels.  
Energetically, they symbolize activation and strength.

##Oxyphil Cells##  
Help regulate hormonal output and metabolism.  
Energetically, they reflect resilience and stability.

##Capsule and Blood Network##  
Provide structure and communication with the thyroid.  
Energetically, they represent grounded connection and nourishment.

###Function###  
Parathyroid glands maintain calcium balance for bone health, nerve conduction, and muscle function.  
Energetically, they support inner strength, grounding, and adaptability.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivity: muscle twitching, restlessness, or anxiety.  
Underactivity: weakness, cramps, or fragility.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect instability, self-doubt, or imbalance in support systems.

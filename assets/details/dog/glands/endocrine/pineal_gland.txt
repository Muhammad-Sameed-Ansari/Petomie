#Pineal Gland#

The dog’s pineal gland is a small, cone-shaped gland deep in the brain that regulates circadian rhythm and light cycles.  
It secretes melatonin and influences sleep, mood, and seasonal patterns.  
Energetically, it represents intuition, inner vision, and spiritual awareness.

###Parts###

##Pinealocytes##  
Cells that produce melatonin in response to darkness.  
Energetically, they symbolize alignment with natural rhythm and rest.

##Nerve Connections##  
Receive signals from the eyes to regulate light perception.  
Energetically, they represent harmony between outer light and inner truth.

##Capillary Network##  
Delivers melatonin into the bloodstream.  
Energetically, it reflects the flow of insight into physical calm.

###Function###  
The pineal gland maintains sleep cycles, seasonal behavior, and internal balance with daylight.  
Energetically, it promotes peace, intuition, and connection to natural timing.

###Common Imbalances###  
Disturbed sleep: overstimulation or lack of rhythm.  
Mood changes: imbalance in light exposure or emotional disconnection.  
Calcification: rigidity or loss of intuitive clarity.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect disconnection from inner guidance or overstimulation by external light.

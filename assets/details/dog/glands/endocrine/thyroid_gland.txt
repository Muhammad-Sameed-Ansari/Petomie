#Thyroid Gland#

The dog’s thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located on either side of the trachea in the neck.  
It controls metabolism, energy, and growth through thyroid hormones.  
Energetically, it represents voice, authenticity, and vitality.

###Parts###

Paired glands along the trachea that produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).  
Energetically, they symbolize balance between giving and receiving energy.

##Isthmus##  
A narrow bridge connecting both lobes.  
Energetically, it represents unity and communication between polarities.

##Follicles##  
Microscopic sacs that store thyroid hormones.  
Energetically, they reflect preparation, timing, and balanced release.

###Function###  
The thyroid regulates metabolic rate, growth, and temperature control.  
Energetically, it governs personal truth, creative expression, and alignment with life’s pace.

###Common Imbalances###  
Hypothyroidism: fatigue, weight gain, depression, slowed rhythm.  
Hyperthyroidism: restlessness, weight loss, anxiety, excessive heat.

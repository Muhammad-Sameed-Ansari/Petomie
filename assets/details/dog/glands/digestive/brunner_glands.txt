#Brunner’s Glands#

The dog’s Brunner’s glands are found in the submucosa of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.  
They secrete alkaline mucus that protects the intestinal lining from stomach acid.  
Energetically, they represent protection, balance, and gentle transitions.

###Parts###

##Submucosal Glands##  
Clusters that secrete mucus and bicarbonate.  
Energetically, they symbolize grounding and neutrality.

##Ducts##  
Tiny channels leading to the duodenal surface.  
Energetically, they reflect smooth flow and communication.

##Glandular Lobules##  
Groupings that maintain constant secretion.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and emotional balance.

###Function###  
Brunner’s glands protect the intestinal walls from acid and help create an optimal environment for enzyme activity.  
Energetically, they ease transitions and maintain calm between change and movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Irritation: tension or poor boundaries.  
Low secretion: vulnerability or weakness in adaptation.  
Inflammation: stress or imbalance in processing.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect loss of calm or protection during transitions.

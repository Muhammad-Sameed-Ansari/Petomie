#Gastric Glands#

The dog’s gastric glands are microscopic glands within the stomach lining.  
They produce digestive acids and enzymes that break down food before it enters the intestines.  
Energetically, they represent inner transformation and the ability to process both nourishment and emotion.

###Parts###

##Cardiac Glands##  
Located near the stomach entrance, secreting protective mucus.  
Energetically, they symbolize openness and preparation for transformation.

##Fundic Glands##  
Found in the central stomach, releasing hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes.  
Energetically, they represent inner fire and strength.

##Pyloric Glands##  
Near the stomach exit, secreting gastrin hormone and mucus.  
Energetically, they reflect timing, release, and emotional closure.

###Function###  
Gastric glands produce enzymes like pepsin and acids that digest proteins.  
They protect the stomach wall and maintain pH balance.  
Energetically, they enable transformation, resilience, and clear inner processing.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivity: acidity, stress, or frustration.  
Underactivity: fatigue or weak digestion.  
Inflammation: irritation or emotional overload.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty digesting experiences or inner tension.

#Lacrimal Glands#

The dog’s lacrimal glands lie in the upper outer corner of each eye, within the bony orbit.  
They produce the watery layer of tears that nourish and cleanse the eye surface.  
Energetically, they represent emotional release, compassion, and renewal.

###Parts###

##Main Lacrimal Gland##  
The primary tear-producing gland above each eye.  
Energetically, it embodies release and gentle cleansing.

##Accessory Lacrimal Glands##  
Smaller glands that maintain tear volume.  
Energetically, they symbolize consistent emotional support and balance.

##Lacrimal Ducts##  
Carry tears to the eye surface for even distribution.  
Energetically, they reflect flow, purification, and emotional circulation.

###Function###  
Lacrimal glands keep the eye hydrated, wash away debris, and protect against infection.  
They contribute to comfort, vision clarity, and overall eye health.  
Energetically, they allow emotions to flow freely and restore balance after tension.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dry eyes: suppressed emotion or grief.  
Watery eyes: overactive emotion or stress.  
Swelling or pain: blocked tears or inner resistance.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect unexpressed sadness or emotional overwhelm.

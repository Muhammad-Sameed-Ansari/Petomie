#Conjunctival Glands#

The dog’s conjunctival glands are small mucous glands within the membrane that lines the inner eyelids and covers the white of the eye.  
They produce mucus that forms part of the tear film, keeping the eye surface smooth and protected.  
Energetically, they represent clarity, adaptability, and emotional transparency.

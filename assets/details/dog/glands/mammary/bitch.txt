#Mammary Glands – Bitch#

##Location##
In the female dog (bitch), the mammary glands are arranged in two rows along the underside of the body, from the chest to the groin area. 
Most dogs have five pairs (ten glands), each with a nipple.

###Shape###
Soft, rounded glands beneath the skin, which enlarge during pregnancy or lactation. 
Each gland contains alveoli (milk-producing cells) and ducts that lead to the nipple.

##Function##
- Produce milk to feed puppies after birth.
- Secrete colostrum right after delivery — rich in antibodies for immune protection.
- Respond to hormonal changes during heat, pregnancy, and nursing.
- Reflect the bitch’s emotional comfort and sense of safety, as stress or fear can inhibit milk letdown.

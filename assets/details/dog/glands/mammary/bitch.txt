#Mammary Glands (Bitch)#

The bitch’s mammary glands are arranged in two rows along the ventral abdomen and chest, extending from the thorax to the groin.  
Most bitches have five pairs of glands that produce milk and provide nourishment to puppies.  
Energetically, they represent nurturing, compassion, and balance between giving and receiving.

###Parts###

##Thoracic Glands##  
Located on the chest, smaller and less active except during lactation.  
Energetically, they symbolize heart-centered care and love through protection.

##Abdominal Glands##  
Situated along the midline of the body, often the most functional during nursing.  
Energetically, they reflect nourishment, grounding, and the flow of maternal energy.

##Inguinal Glands##  
Found near the groin, typically the largest pair.  
Energetically, they represent fertility, rooted stability, and nurturing connection.

###Function###  
Mammary glands produce and secrete milk after birth under the influence of hormones such as prolactin and oxytocin.  
They nourish newborn puppies and strengthen the maternal bond.  
Energetically, they support creative flow, compassion, and emotional fulfillment.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling or mastitis: overgiving, stress, or emotional pressure.  
Lumps or tumors: suppressed care, resentment, or imbalance in self-nurturing.  
Reduced milk flow: fatigue, anxiety, or blocked emotional flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect exhaustion, boundary strain, or difficulty receiving love.

#Mammary Glands#

##Location##
Arranged in two parallel rows along the ventral thorax and abdomen, extending from the chest to the inguinal region. Dogs typically have 8–10 mammary glands (4–5 pairs), though the number can vary.

##Parts##
Glandular Tissue produces milk and consists of alveoli connected by ducts.
Teats (Nipples) are the external openings for milk secretion.
Supporting Connective Tissue provides anchorage and protection for the glands.

##Function##
Modified sweat glands that produce and secrete milk to nourish puppies. They are essential for maternal care, neonatal survival, and play a role in mother–offspring bonding.

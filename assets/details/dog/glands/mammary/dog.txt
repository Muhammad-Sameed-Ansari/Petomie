#Mammary Glands – Male#

##Location##
In the male dog, small, undeveloped mammary glands are found along the same line as in females, from the chest to the groin. 
They are non-functional and lie flat beneath the skin.

###Shape###
Tiny, inactive gland areas beneath the nipples, without ducts or milk-producing tissue.

##Function##
- Do not produce milk or secrete fluid.
- Represent a developmental remnant — all mammals start with similar gland structures before hormones define sex.
- Carry symbolic and energetic meaning of balance between masculine protection and gentle empathy.

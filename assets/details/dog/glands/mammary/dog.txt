#Mammary Glands (Male Dog)#

The male dog’s mammary glands are small and undeveloped, lying along the same ventral line as the bitch’s but remaining inactive.  
Though they serve no functional purpose, they share embryonic origin with the female glands.  
Energetically, they represent balance, compassion, and integration of nurturing energy within strength.

###Parts###

##Thoracic and Abdominal Glands##  
Tiny, flat glands beneath the skin of the chest and abdomen.  
Energetically, they symbolize latent care, empathy, and emotional awareness.

##Inguinal Glands##  
Small paired structures near the groin, often barely visible.  
Energetically, they reflect harmony between gentleness and grounded masculinity.

##Nipples##  
Visible along the ventral midline but nonfunctional in milk production.  
Energetically, they represent balance between giving and receiving.

###Function###  
In males, mammary glands are vestigial and do not produce milk.  
They remain hormonally dormant but share structural similarity with the bitch’s glands.  
Energetically, they express the potential for empathy and caring presence without losing strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling or enlargement: hormonal imbalance or endocrine stress.  
Sensitivity: energetic confusion or over-identification with others’ emotions.  
Infection: irritation or internal conflict.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect resistance to tenderness or fear of emotional openness.

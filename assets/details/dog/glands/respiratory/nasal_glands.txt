#Nasal Glands#

The dog’s nasal glands are small mucous and serous glands inside the nasal cavity.  
They keep the nose moist and aid in scent detection.  
Energetically, they represent intuition, perception, and awareness of the unseen.

###Parts###

##Lateral Nasal Glands##  
Located along the sides of the nasal cavity.  
Energetically, they symbolize sensory awareness and adaptability.

##Maxillary Glands##  
Produce watery secretion to maintain moisture.  
Energetically, they represent clarity and sensitivity.

##Septal Glands##  
Situated along the nasal septum for even hydration.  
Energetically, they reflect balance and centered awareness.

###Function###  
Nasal glands moisten the nasal passages and enhance the dog’s ability to smell.  
Energetically, they promote clear perception and intuitive sensitivity.

###Common Imbalances###  
Dry nose: dehydration or emotional dullness.  
Over-secretion: irritation or overstimulation.  
Infection: imbalance in boundaries or overwhelm.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect confusion, sensory overload, or disconnection from intuition.

#Bronchial Glands#

The dog’s bronchial glands are found in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles within the lungs.  
They produce mucus and fluid that moisten, protect, and cleanse the airways.  
Energetically, they represent release, peace, and renewal through breath.

###Parts###

##Mucous Cells##  
Produce thick mucus that traps dust and microorganisms.  
Energetically, they symbolize protection and grounding, helping release built-up tension.

##Serous Cells##  
Secrete watery fluid to balance the thickness of mucus.  
Energetically, they represent clarity, fluidity, and adaptability.

##Ducts##  
Carry the secretions into the bronchial passages.  
Energetically, they reflect direction, flow, and purification.

###Function###  
Bronchial glands maintain the moisture of the airways, filter debris, and support immune defense.  
They ensure smooth airflow and healthy lung function.  
Energetically, they help the dog let go of tension, grief, and heavy emotions, restoring ease of breathing and calm presence.

###Common Imbalances###  
Excess mucus: inflammation, irritation, or emotional heaviness.  
Dryness: stress, dehydration, or blocked flow.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect difficulty releasing sadness, emotional congestion, or fear of vulnerability.

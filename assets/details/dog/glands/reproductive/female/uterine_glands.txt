#Uterine Glands#

The dog’s uterine glands line the inner surface of the uterus.  
They produce nourishing secretions essential for embryo development before the placenta forms.  
Energetically, they represent creation, nurturing depth, and the quiet cultivation of new life.

###Parts###

##Glandular Tubules##  
Produce uterine milk (histotrophe) to support early embryos.  
Energetically, they symbolize nourishment, inner growth, and creative flow.

##Secretory Cells##  
Release proteins, nutrients, and protective factors.  
Energetically, they reflect generosity, care, and fertile potential.

##Stromal Support##  
Provides structural integrity within the uterine lining.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, stability, and readiness for creation.

###Function###  
Uterine glands nourish embryos, maintain uterine health, and support fertility.  
Energetically, they sustain creative intention, nurturing energy, and deep feminine power.

###Common Imbalances###  
Low secretion: hormonal imbalance or infertility.  
Inflammation: infection or irritation.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect blocked creative flow or disrupted nurturing.

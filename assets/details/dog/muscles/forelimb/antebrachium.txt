#Antebrachium Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the **elbow and carpus (wrist)**, forming the middle section of the forelimb.  
These muscles control **flexion and extension** of the carpus and digits, and also assist in **rotation and stabilization** of the forearm.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, strap-like and tendinous muscles** arranged into **cranial (extensor)** and **caudal (flexor)** groups.  
Their elongated tendons continue into the manus to control precise paw and claw movements.

##Parts##

###Cranial (Extensor) Group###

###1. Extensor Carpi Radialis###
- On the dorsolateral forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends carpus and stabilizes wrist during movement.  

###2. Common Digital Extensor###
- Along dorsal midline of forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends digits II–V and carpus.  

###3. Lateral Digital Extensor###
- Lateral to the common digital extensor.  
- **Function:** Extends digits III–V independently.  

###4. Ulnaris Lateralis###
- On caudolateral forearm.  
- **Function:** Extends or flexes carpus depending on position.  

###5. Supinator###
- Wraps around proximal radius.  
- **Function:** Rotates paw laterally (supination).

###Caudal (Flexor) Group###

###6. Flexor Carpi Radialis###
- Medial side of forearm.  
- **Function:** Flexes carpus and stabilizes forelimb.  

###7. Flexor Carpi Ulnaris###
- Has humeral and ulnar heads.  
- **Function:** Flexes carpus and supports weight.  

###8. Superficial Digital Flexor###
- Between carpal flexors.  
- **Function:** Flexes proximal interphalangeal joints and carpus.  

###9. Deep Digital Flexor###
- Deepest layer, with three heads.  
- **Function:** Flexes digits and retracts claws.  

###10. Pronator Teres###
- Medial side of elbow.  
- **Function:** Rotates paw medially (pronation).  

###11. Pronator Quadratus###
- Flat muscle between radius and ulna.  
- **Function:** Maintains pronation and stabilizes forearm.

##Function##
- **Extension:** Dorsal group extends carpus and digits.  
- **Flexion:** Ventral group flexes carpus and digits.  
- **Rotation:** Supinator and pronators rotate paw for grooming and coordination.  
- **Stability:** Supports carpal and digital joints during movement.

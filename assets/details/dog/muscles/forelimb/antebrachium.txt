#Antebrachium#

The dog’s antebrachium forms the **forearm region**, between the elbow and the carpus.  
It contains muscles that control paw flexion, extension, and rotation.  
Energetically, it represents **action, coordination, and balance between control and expression**.

###Parts###

##Extensor Group##  
Located dorsally, responsible for extending the carpus and digits.  
Energetically, symbolizes **strength and outward expression**.

##Flexor Group##  
Located palmarly, responsible for flexing the carpus and digits.  
Energetically, reflects **adaptability and receiving energy**.

##Radial Muscles##  
Stabilize and guide the paw during motion.  
Energetically, represent **direction and centered focus**.

###Function###  
Coordinates limb movement, absorbs impact, and ensures smooth gait transitions.  
Energetically, anchors **fluid control and purposeful action**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: stiffness or shortened stride.  
Weakness: reduced grip or instability.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of precision or tension in expression**.

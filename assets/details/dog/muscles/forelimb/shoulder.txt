#Shoulder Muscles#

##Location##
Located around the **scapular region**, connecting the **neck, thorax, and upper limb**.  
These muscles provide movement and stabilization of the **scapulohumeral (shoulder) joint**.

##Shape##
Composed of **broad, powerful muscles** surrounding the scapula and humerus.  
Arranged into extrinsic (connecting limb to trunk) and intrinsic (within the shoulder girdle) groups.

##Parts##

###Extrinsic Muscles###

###1. Trapezius###
- Two parts: cervical and thoracic.  
- **Function:** Elevates and advances the scapula.  

###2. Rhomboideus###
- Lies deep to the trapezius.  
- **Function:** Draws the scapula upward and medially, supports shoulder elevation.  

###3. Serratus Ventralis###
- Fan-shaped, between cervical vertebrae and scapula.  
- **Function:** Suspends trunk between forelimbs and assists scapular rotation.  

###4. Omotransversarius###
- Narrow strap-like muscle from atlas to shoulder.  
- **Function:** Advances the limb and flexes neck laterally.  

###Intrinsic Muscles###

###5. Deltoideus###
- Covers lateral scapular region.  
- **Function:** Flexes the shoulder joint.  

###6. Supraspinatus###
- Occupies the supraspinous fossa.  
- **Function:** Extends and stabilizes the shoulder.  

###7. Infraspinatus###
- Occupies infraspinous fossa.  
- **Function:** Flexes and stabilizes the shoulder joint.  

###8. Subscapularis###
- Found on the medial scapula.  
- **Function:** Adducts and stabilizes shoulder.  

###9. Teres Major###
- Caudal to subscapularis.  
- **Function:** Flexes and rotates humerus medially.  

##Function##
- **Support:** Suspend the trunk and stabilize the scapula.  
- **Movement:** Allow limb protraction, retraction, and rotation.  
- **Stability:** Maintain shoulder alignment and absorb impact during motion.

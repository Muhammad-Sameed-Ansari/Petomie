#Deltoid Group#

The dog’s deltoid group lies over the shoulder joint, controlling abduction and flexion of the forelimb.  
These muscles stabilize and move the scapula and humerus.  
Energetically, they represent **freedom, strength, and fluid coordination**.

###Parts###

##Acromial Deltoid##  
Originates from the acromion and inserts on the humerus.  
Abducts and flexes the shoulder.  
Energetically, symbolizes **freedom and fluid power**.

##Scapular Deltoid##  
Originates from the scapular spine and assists in flexion.  
Energetically, reflects **balance between stability and expansion**.

###Function###  
Supports shoulder rotation and outward limb motion.  
Energetically, harmonizes **strength and graceful movement**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted shoulder lift or stiffness.  
Weakness: reduced coordination or poor limb placement.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **inner resistance or hesitancy to move forward**.

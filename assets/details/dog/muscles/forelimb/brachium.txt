#Brachium Muscles#

##Location##
Situated between the **shoulder and elbow (humerus region)**.  
These muscles control **flexion and extension of the elbow**, aiding forelimb movement and stability.

##Shape##
Composed of **long, cylindrical muscles** surrounding the humerus.  
Divided into **cranial (extensor)** and **caudal (flexor)** groups.

##Parts##

###Cranial (Extensor) Group###

###1. Biceps Brachii###
- Long muscle on cranial surface of humerus.  
- **Function:** Flexes elbow and extends shoulder.  

###2. Brachialis###
- Lies lateral and spirals around humerus.  
- **Function:** Flexes elbow joint.

###Caudal (Extensor) Group###

###3. Triceps Brachii###
- Large muscle with long, lateral, and medial heads.  
- **Function:** Extends elbow and supports weight during stance.  

###4. Tensor Fasciae Antebrachii###
- Lies medial to triceps.  
- **Function:** Extends elbow and tightens antebrachial fascia.  

##Function##
- **Flexion:** Biceps and brachialis flex the elbow.  
- **Extension:** Triceps and tensor fasciae extend elbow and bear weight.  
- **Support:** Maintain limb extension during standing and propulsion.

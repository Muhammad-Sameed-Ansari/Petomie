#Supinator Muscle#

The dog’s supinator muscle rotates the forearm outward, turning the paw upward.  
It works opposite to the pronator group, balancing rotational control.  
Energetically, it represents **openness, balance, and readiness for action**.

###Parts###

##Supinator##  
Encircles the radius, pulling it into external rotation.  
Energetically, symbolizes **expansion and balanced control**.

##Lateral Stabilizers##  
Assist with outward turning of the forelimb.  
Energetically, reflect **freedom and adaptive balance**.

###Function###  
Rotates the forearm and stabilizes the paw during turning or shifting direction.  
Energetically, aligns **physical precision with mental readiness**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted outward rotation.  
Weakness: reduced limb control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **hesitation or suppressed expression**.

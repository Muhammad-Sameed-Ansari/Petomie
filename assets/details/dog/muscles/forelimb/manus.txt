#Manus Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **distal forelimb**, forming the structure of the **paw**.  
Includes small intrinsic muscles controlling fine digital movements and claw control.

##Shape##
Composed of **short, tendinous and interwoven muscles** beneath the carpal and metacarpal fascia.  
They are organized into **extensor**, **flexor**, and **interosseous** groups.

##Parts##

###1. Interossei (Lumbrical) Muscles###
- Between metacarpal bones.  
- **Function:** Flex metacarpophalangeal joints and extend interphalangeal joints.  

###2. Extensor Tendons###
- Terminal portions of digital extensors.  
- **Function:** Extend digits and stabilize claws.  

###3. Flexor Tendons###
- Continue from superficial and deep digital flexors.  
- **Function:** Flex digits and aid claw retraction.  

###4. Abductor Pollicis Longus###
- Small lateral muscle near radius.  
- **Function:** Abducts first digit.  

###5. Palmar Interossei###
- Deep to digital tendons.  
- **Function:** Support paw arch and assist flexion.  

##Function##
Control **fine motor movements** of the paw and claws.  
Provide **grip, traction, and surface balance** during locomotion.  
Assist in **shock absorption** and paw stabilization during weight-bearing.

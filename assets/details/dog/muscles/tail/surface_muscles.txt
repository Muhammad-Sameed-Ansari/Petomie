#Tail Muscles – Surface Layer#

##Location##
Located on the **outer aspect of the tail and tail base**, just beneath the skin.  
These muscles lie over the caudal vertebrae and blend with the superficial fascia around the rump.

###Shape###
Composed of **thin, strap-like or sheet-like muscle slips** that follow the tail’s length.  
They are closely associated with the **cutaneous trunci** and superficial fibers of dorsal and ventral tail movers.

##Parts##

###1. Caudal Extension of Cutaneous Trunci###
- Superficial sheet over the lateral tail base.  
- **Function:** Aids fine skin movement and assists subtle tail positioning.

###2. Superficial Slips of Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Lateralis###
- Run along the **dorsolateral tail**.  
- **Function:** Elevate and slightly abduct the tail.

###3. Superficial Slips of Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Lateralis###
- Run along the **ventrolateral tail**.  
- **Function:** Depress and adduct the tail.

###4. Superficial Intertransversarii Caudae###
- Short segments between adjacent caudal vertebrae.  
- **Function:** Assist **side-to-side** tail motion and surface stabilization.

##Function##
Provide **fine surface control** of the tail for signalling and balance.  
Assist deeper muscles in **elevation, depression, and mild abduction/adduction**.  
Contribute to **skin movement**, comfort, and subtle adjustments at the tail base.

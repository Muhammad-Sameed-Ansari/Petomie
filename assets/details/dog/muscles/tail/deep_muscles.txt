#Tail Muscles – Deep Layer#

##Location##
Closest to the **caudal vertebrae**, lying beneath the main dorsal and ventral tail muscles.  
Concentrated at the **tail base** and along the vertebral column for segmental control.

###Shape###
Composed of **short, segmental muscles** attaching between neighboring vertebrae (spines, laminae, and transverse processes).  
Designed for **fine stabilization** rather than large movements.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidi Caudae (Deep Part of Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis)###
- Short fascicles linking vertebral spines along the dorsal tail.  
- **Function:** **Stabilize** and finely **extend** individual tail segments.

###2. Interspinales Caudae###
- Small muscles between adjacent dorsal spines.  
- **Function:** Provide **segmental extension** and midline stability.

###3. Intertransversarii Caudae Profundi###
- Deep slips between transverse processes.  
- **Function:** **Control lateral micro-movements** and resist unwanted side-bending.

##Function##
Ensure **segment-by-segment stability** of the tail for smooth, coordinated motion.  
Allow **fine-tuned adjustments** during balance, turning, and communication.  
Support the **tail base and pelvic outlet** by controlling shear and torsion at the caudal vertebrae.

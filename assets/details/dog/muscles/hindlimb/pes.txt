#Pes Muscles#

The dog’s pes muscles form the **distal hindlimb**, controlling the hock, digits, and paw.  
They are key for traction, propulsion, and precise footing.  
Energetically, they represent **grounding, balance, and connection with the Earth**.

###Parts###

##Digital Flexors##  
Flex the toes and stabilize stance.  
Energetically, symbolize **connection and adaptability**.

##Digital Extensors##  
Extend toes for propulsion.  
Energetically, reflect **expansion and readiness**.

##Suspensory Ligaments##  
Prevent overextension and maintain balance.  
Energetically, embody **protection and endurance**.

###Function###  
Provide balance, grip, and motion control during movement.  
Energetically, link **physical grounding with energetic flow**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted paw flexion.  
Weakness: instability or slippage.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **disconnection from grounding**.

#Hip and Thigh Muscles#

##Location##
Situated between the **pelvis and stifle (knee)**, surrounding the femur.  
These muscles are responsible for limb power and joint movement during locomotion.

##Shape##
Long, cylindrical muscles forming the bulk of the upper hindlimb.  
Grouped along the cranial, caudal, and medial sides for coordinated hip and stifle action.

##Parts##

###1. Biceps Femoris###
- Large muscle on the lateral thigh.  
- Extends hip and stifle, flexes hock.  

###2. Semitendinosus###
- Caudal thigh muscle running to the tibia.  
- Extends hip and hock, flexes stifle.  

###3. Semimembranosus###
- Lies medial to semitendinosus.  
- Extends hip and adducts limb.  

###4. Quadriceps Femoris###
- Large muscle group on the cranial thigh.  
- Extends stifle and flexes hip.  

###5. Sartorius###
- Thin, strap-like muscle on the medial thigh.  
- Flexes hip and stifle.  

###6. Gracilis###
- Broad muscle on the inner thigh.  
- Adducts limb and extends hip and hock.  

###7. Pectineus###
- Small medial muscle.  
- Adducts and stabilizes the femur.  

###8. Adductor###
- Deep muscle of the medial thigh.  
- Draws limb inward and stabilizes stance.  

##Function##
Extend and flex hip, stifle, and hock joints.  
Provide power for propulsion, stability, and balance during running or jumping.  
Maintain limb alignment and posture.

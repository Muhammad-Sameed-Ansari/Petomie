#Hip and Thigh Muscles#

The dog’s hip and thigh muscles connect the pelvis to the femur, stabilizing and powering hindlimb motion.  
They control hip flexion, extension, and rotation.  
Energetically, they represent **strength, alignment, and grounded purpose**.

###Parts###

##Hamstring Group##  
Includes biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus.  
Extends the hip and flexes the stifle.  
Energetically, symbolizes **drive and stability**.

##Quadriceps Femoris##  
Extends the stifle and stabilizes the limb.  
Energetically, reflects **determination and forward energy**.

##Tensor Fasciae Latae##  
Stabilizes the hip and assists limb movement.  
Energetically, embodies **fluid strength and adaptability**.

###Function###  
Coordinates hindlimb propulsion, posture, and control.  
Energetically, balances **movement with purpose**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: shortened stride or restricted hip motion.  
Weakness: poor posture or reduced propulsion.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **tension between movement and intention**.

#Popliteus#

The dog’s popliteus is a small triangular muscle at the back of the stifle.  
It rotates the tibia inward and stabilizes the knee joint during movement.  
Energetically, it represents **adaptability, grounding, and precise control**.

###Parts###

##Body##  
Triangular muscle running from femur to tibia.  
Energetically, symbolizes **support and stabilization**.

##Tendinous Attachment##  
Anchors the muscle at the lateral condyle of the femur.  
Energetically, reflects **firm connection and grounded confidence**.

###Function###  
Stabilizes the stifle during flexion and prevents over-rotation.  
Energetically, maintains **balance between stability and movement**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted joint rotation.  
Weakness: instability in knee region.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of grounding or indecision**.

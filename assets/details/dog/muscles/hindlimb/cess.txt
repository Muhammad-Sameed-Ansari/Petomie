#Cess (Gluteal Muscles)#

##Location##
Located over the **pelvic region** and forming the upper part of the hindquarters.  
These muscles connect the pelvis to the femur and generate the main power for hindlimb propulsion.

##Shape##
Broad, thick, and layered muscles that provide strength and control for hip extension and abduction.  
Arranged in superficial, middle, and deep layers to balance flexibility and stability.

##Parts##

###1. Superficial Gluteal###
- Lies over the hip joint.  
- Extends and abducts the thigh.  

###2. Middle Gluteal###
- Largest of the gluteal muscles.  
- Extends the hip and moves the limb backward.  

###3. Deep Gluteal###
- Lies beneath the middle gluteal.  
- Rotates the limb medially and stabilizes the hip.  

###4. Tensor Fasciae Latae###
- Located at the front of the thigh.  
- Flexes the hip and tightens the fascia lata for limb support.  

##Function##
Extend, abduct, and stabilize the hip joint.  
Provide propulsion and maintain pelvic alignment during motion.

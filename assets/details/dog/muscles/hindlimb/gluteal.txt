#Gluteal Region#

The dog’s gluteal muscles form the **buttock area**, connecting the pelvis to the femur.  
They are responsible for hip extension, abduction, and stability.  
Energetically, they represent **power, confidence, and forward thrust**.

###Parts###

##Superficial Gluteal##  
Extends the hip and assists in limb abduction.  
Energetically, symbolizes **freedom and motion**.

##Middle Gluteal##  
Primary extensor of the hip, providing propulsion.  
Energetically, represents **inner strength and movement of purpose**.

##Deep Gluteal##  
Stabilizes and rotates the femur.  
Energetically, reflects **foundation and balance**.

###Function###  
Supports propulsion, hip rotation, and limb stability.  
Energetically, harmonizes **physical strength with emotional confidence**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted hip extension.  
Weakness: loss of propulsion or poor posture.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **insecurity or hesitation in progress**.

#Crus Muscles#

The dog’s crus muscles form the **lower hindlimb**, extending from the stifle to the hock.  
They control flexion and extension of the hock and toes, ensuring balance and propulsion.  
Energetically, they represent **momentum, stability, and adaptability in motion**.

###Parts###

##Gastrocnemius##  
Large muscle forming the calf, extends the hock.  
Energetically, symbolizes **drive and strength**.

##Soleus##  
Assists the gastrocnemius in extension.  
Energetically, reflects **support and endurance**.

##Digital Flexors##  
Flex the toes and aid propulsion.  
Energetically, embody **connection to purpose and forward flow**.

###Function###  
Provide propulsion, absorb shock, and maintain posture during movement.  
Energetically, they anchor **grounded action with controlled energy**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: stiffness or shortened stride.  
Weakness: instability or reduced propulsion.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **lack of grounding or overexertion**.

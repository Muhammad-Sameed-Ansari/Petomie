#Tail Muscles (Caudal)#

##Location##
Located at the base and along the length of the tail (caudal region), extending from the sacrum and ischium to the caudal (coccygeal) vertebrae and tail skin.
These muscles form the core of the tail, arranged dorsally, ventrally, and laterally around the coccygeal vertebrae.

##Shape##
Composed of paired, elongated muscles that decrease in size toward the distal tail.
Arranged in dorsal and ventral layers, they provide flexibility, strength, and precise control of tail motion.
The fibers interconnect along the vertebrae, allowing complex and rapid tail movements for balance and expression.

##Parts##
###1. Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Lateralis###
Arises from the sacrum and first caudal vertebrae.
Inserts on the lateral aspects of more distal caudal vertebrae.
Elevates and moves the tail laterally.
###2. Sacrocaudalis Dorsalis Medialis###
Lies medial to the lateral portion.
Runs along the dorsal midline of the tail.
Elevates and extends the tail dorsally.
###3. Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Lateralis###
Located ventrolateral to the caudal vertebrae.
Flexes the tail ventrally and laterally.
Works in opposition to the dorsal muscles for balance.
###4. Sacrocaudalis Ventralis Medialis###
Lies ventral and close to the midline.
Depresses the tail directly downward.
###5. Intertransversarii Caudae###
Small, segmental muscles connecting adjacent transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae.
Stabilize and fine-tune tail position.
###6. Coccygeus###
Triangular muscle extending from the ischiatic spine to the transverse processes of the first few caudal vertebrae.
Pulls the tail downward and laterally.
Assists in returning the tail to midline.
###7. Levator Ani###
Found deep to the coccygeus muscle.
Elevates the anal region and aids in defecation.

##Function##
Control tail movement in all directions: elevation, depression, and lateral motion.
Essential for balance, communication, and emotional signaling (wagging, tucking, or raising the tail).
Assist in defecation and anal sphincter control.
Maintain tail alignment and muscle tone for expressive and functional movement.

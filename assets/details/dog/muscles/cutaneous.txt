#Cutaneous Muscles#

##Location##
Located beneath the skin across much of the trunk, neck, and limbs, forming a thin, mobile muscular layer between the skin and underlying fascia.
These muscles are particularly well developed in dogs, enabling movement of the skin independent of the deeper body muscles.

##Shape##
Composed of flat, thin, sheet-like muscles closely attached to the dermis.
The fibers run superficially and are continuous with the fascia of surrounding regions.
In dogs, they are most developed over the neck, shoulders, and thorax, forming visible skin twitches when stimulated.

##Parts##
###1. Cutaneous Trunci (Panniculus Carnosus)###
Broad sheet covering the lateral thorax and abdomen.
Origin: fascia over the latissimus dorsi and trunk.
Insertion: dermis of the skin on the body wall.
Function: Moves the skin, assists in twitch reflex to repel insects, and supports thermoregulation by altering skin tension.
###2. Cutaneous Colli###
Thin muscle at the ventral neck.
Origin: manubrium and fascia of the sternum.
Insertion: fascia of the neck and shoulder.
Function: Tenses the skin of the neck and draws it caudally.
###3. Cutaneous Omobrachialis###
Extends over the shoulder and upper forelimb region.
Function: Moves skin of the shoulder and aids in forelimb motion.
###4. Platysma###
Superficial muscle of the head and neck.
Origin: fascia of the neck.
Insertion: corners of the mouth and lips.
Function: Retracts corners of the mouth and moves facial skin.
###5. Cutaneous Maximus###
Found along the lateral face and neck region.
Function: Moves facial skin and lips, important in expression and communication.

##Function##
Skin movement: Allows independent motion of skin for defense and comfort (e.g., twitching).
Protection: Assists in dislodging insects and external irritants.
Communication: Enables subtle skin and facial expressions.
Thermoregulation: Adjusts skin tension and surface area to assist heat exchange.
Support: Maintains skin elasticity and tone.

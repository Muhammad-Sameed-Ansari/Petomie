#Cutaneous Muscle#

##Location##
Situated within the **superficial fascia** just beneath the skin, covering the **neck, trunk, and limbs**.  
Most developed along the **lateral thorax and abdomen**, with extensions to the **shoulder, flank, and thigh**.  
In the dog, this muscle is particularly thick along the sides and used extensively for body shaking.

##Shape##
A **broad, thin muscular sheet** of fine fibers interlaced with connective tissue.  
It lies loosely over the deep fascia, allowing large skin movements.  
Strongest over the **cutaneous trunci region** and thinner over limbs and dorsal areas.

##Parts##

###1. Cutaneous Trunci###
- The largest part of the cutaneous system.  
- Covers the sides of the thorax and abdomen.  
- Extends forward to the shoulder and backward to the thigh.  
- Attached to the fascia over the triceps and latissimus dorsi.  

###2. Cutaneous Colli###
- Located on the ventral neck.  
- Arises from the manubrium of the sternum and extends obliquely backward.  
- Thicker in males; assists with ventral neck skin movement.  

###3. Cutaneous Omobrachialis###
- Small muscle near the shoulder region.  
- Connects the skin over the shoulder and upper limb.  

###4. Facial Cutaneous Areas###
- Small, superficial slips associated with skin over the lips, cheeks, and ears.  
- Functionally linked with facial expression muscles.  

##Function##
- Produces **skin twitching (panniculus reflex)** to repel insects or irritants.  
- Enables **body shaking** to remove water or debris.  
- Enhances **skin mobility** during movement and stretching.  
- Assists with **thermoregulation** by increasing airflow over the skin.

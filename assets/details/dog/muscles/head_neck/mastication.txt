#Mastication Muscles#

##Location##
These muscles are found around the jaw and sides of the head, near the cheeks, temples, and lower jawbone.
They control the opening and closing of the mouth and the chewing motion when a dog eats.

##Shape##
They are strong, thick muscles that work together to let the jaw move up, down, and side to side.
These muscles give dogs their powerful bite and ability to chew food efficiently.

Large cheek muscle on the side of the jaw.
Function: Closes the mouth and helps move the jaw side to side for chewing.
###2. Temporalis###

Function: Helps support the tongue and assists in opening the mouth.

##Function##
Close the mouth: Masseter, temporalis, and pterygoid muscles lift the jaw.
Open the mouth: Digastricus and mylohyoideus pull the jaw down.
Chew and grind: Pterygoid muscles move the jaw from side to side.

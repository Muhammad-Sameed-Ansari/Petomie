#Mastication Muscles#

##Location##
Located around the **jaw and cheek area**, connecting the **mandible to the skull**.  
They generate the **chewing and biting forces** essential for eating, playing, and carrying objects.

##Shape##
Composed of **strong, thick muscles** with short fibers and wide attachments.  
Provide great closing strength for the jaws, typical of carnivores.

##Parts##

###1. Masseter###
Large lateral cheek muscle.  
- Elevates and closes the jaw  
- Provides primary chewing force

###2. Temporalis###
Covers the temporal region of the skull.  
- Elevates and retracts the mandible  
- Major muscle for biting power

###3. Medial Pterygoid###
On the inner surface of the mandible.  
- Elevates the mandible  
- Assists side-to-side motion for grinding

###4. Lateral Pterygoid###
Deep muscle connecting skull to mandible.  
- Pulls mandible forward  
- Assists in opening the mouth

###5. Digastricus###
Ventral jaw muscle.  
- Opens the mouth by lowering the mandible  
- Opposes the masseter and temporalis

##Function##
- Enables **chewing, biting, and gripping** actions  
- Provides **strong jaw closure** for feeding and defense  
- Assists **opening and stabilizing** the jaw during motion  
- Coordinates with **tongue and facial muscles** for precise eating movements

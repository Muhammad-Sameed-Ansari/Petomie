#Facial Muscles#

##Location##
These muscles are found around the eyes, mouth, nose, and ears.
They are attached to the skin instead of bone, which allows dogs to make facial expressions, move their lips and ears, and control blinking and whisker movement.

##Shape##
They are thin, flat, and delicate muscles that sit just under the skin.
They work together to create expressions, help with communication, and support basic actions like blinking, chewing, and sniffing.

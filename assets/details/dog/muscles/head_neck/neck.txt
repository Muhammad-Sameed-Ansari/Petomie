#Neck Muscles#

##Location##
Situated along the **cervical region**, connecting the **head, shoulders, and thorax**.  
These muscles provide essential support for **head and neck motion, posture, and coordination** during locomotion and communication.

##Shape##
Composed of **elongated and layered muscles**, arranged to balance strength and flexibility.  
They allow both fine head movement and strong extension for pulling or stabilizing actions.

##Parts##

###1. Brachiocephalicus###
Long, strap-like muscle from the head and neck to the humerus.  
- Pulls the forelimb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally when one side contracts  
- Extends the shoulder joint

###2. Sternocephalicus###
Runs from the sternum to the skull.  
- Flexes the head and neck  
- Assists in head turning

###3. Splenius###
Broad, flat dorsal neck muscle beneath the trapezius.  
- Elevates and extends the head and neck  
- Assists in lateral flexion

###4. Semispinalis Capitis###
Deep dorsal muscle connecting the upper thoracic vertebrae to the skull.  
- Extends and stabilizes the neck  
- Elevates the head

###5. Longus Colli###
Deep ventral muscle along the cervical vertebrae.  
- Flexes the neck ventrally  
- Stabilizes the vertebral column

###6. Trapezius (Cervical Part)###
Superficial triangular muscle covering the neck.  
- Elevates and advances the scapula  
- Assists forelimb motion

###7. Rhomboideus###
Deep to trapezius, extending from the neck to the scapula.  
- Elevates and rotates the scapula  
- Stabilizes the shoulder

###8. Omotransversarius###
Narrow muscle between the atlas and scapula.  
- Pulls the forelimb forward  
- Flexes the neck laterally

###9. Serratus Ventralis (Cervical Part)###
Fan-shaped muscle linking cervical vertebrae to the scapula.  
- Supports the trunk  
- Raises the neck and stabilizes the shoulder

###10. Nuchal Ligament###
Elastic ligament from the skull to the thoracic vertebrae.  
- Supports the head  
- Allows passive head elevation with minimal effort

##Function##
- Enables **flexion, extension, and lateral bending** of the neck  
- Supports **head posture and motion** during activity  
- Assists in **forelimb coordination and stabilization**  
- Provides **balance and flexibility** during movement

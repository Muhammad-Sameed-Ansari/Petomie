#Brachium#

##Location##
The brachium, or upper arm, of the dog is the region between the shoulder joint and the elbow joint.
It connects the scapula to the radius and ulna and forms the upper portion of the forelimb.

##Shape##
Contains the humerus, a single large bone surrounded by strong flexor and extensor muscles.
The brachium is muscular and cylindrical, tapering toward the elbow.

##Main Bones##
- **Humerus:** The only bone in the brachium; articulates proximally with the scapula and distally with the radius and ulna.

##Main Muscles##
- **Biceps Brachii:** Located on the cranial aspect; flexes the elbow and extends the shoulder.
- **Brachialis:** Lies on the lateral side; assists in elbow flexion.
- **Triceps Brachii (long, lateral, medial, and accessory heads):** Occupies the caudal aspect; extends the elbow and supports weight-bearing.
- **Tensor Fasciae Antebrachii:** Thin muscle on the medial side of the triceps; assists in elbow extension.
- **Deltoideus:** Flexes and abducts the shoulder joint.
- **Teres Major:** Flexes and medially rotates the shoulder.
- **Coracobrachialis:** Small, stabilizing muscle on the medial side of the shoulder joint.

##Function##
- Controls flexion and extension of the shoulder and elbow joints.
- Provides strength and support during weight-bearing and propulsion.
- Contributes to forward motion of the forelimb during running and climbing.

#Antebrachium#

##Location##
The antebrachium, or forearm, of the dog lies between the elbow joint and the carpus (wrist).
It connects the brachium to the manus and forms the middle segment of the forelimb.

##Shape##
Composed of two long parallel bones—the radius and ulna—surrounded by powerful flexor and extensor muscles.
Unlike in horses, the dog’s radius and ulna are separate, allowing pronation and supination of the forelimb.
The antebrachium is elongated and cylindrical, tapering toward the carpus.

##Main Bones##
- **Radius:** The main weight-bearing bone of the forearm; broad proximally, tapering distally to articulate with the carpus.
- **Ulna:** Runs parallel and lateral to the radius; forms the olecranon process (the point of the elbow) and allows leverage for muscle attachment.

##Main Muscles##
- **Extensor Carpi Radialis:** Extends the carpus and stabilizes the wrist during weight-bearing.
- **Common Digital Extensor:** Extends the digits and carpus.
- **Lateral Digital Extensor:** Extends the lateral digits and assists in balance.
- **Flexor Carpi Radialis:** Flexes the carpus; located medially.
- **Flexor Carpi Ulnaris:** Flexes the carpus; located caudally.
- **Superficial Digital Flexor:** Flexes the digits and carpus.
- **Deep Digital Flexor:** Lies deep to the superficial flexor; flexes the digits.
- **Pronator Teres:** Rotates the paw inward (pronation).
- **Supinator:** Rotates the paw outward (supination).

##Function##
- Provides flexion, extension, rotation, and stability to the forearm and paw.
- Allows manipulation of the paw during movement, grasping, and digging.
- Supports the body’s weight during stance and absorbs shock during locomotion.

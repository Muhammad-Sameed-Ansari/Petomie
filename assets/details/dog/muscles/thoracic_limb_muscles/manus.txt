#Manus#

##Location##
The manus, or forepaw, of the dog is the distal region of the forelimb below the carpus.
It includes the metacarpals, phalanges, and sesamoid bones, as well as the claws and pads.

##Shape##
The manus consists of five digits (I–V), each formed by metacarpal bones and phalanges.
Digit I (dewclaw) is often smaller or absent, while digits II–V bear weight.
Each digit ends in a curved claw supported by a distal phalanx.

##Main Bones##
- **Metacarpals I–V:** Long bones between the carpus and the phalanges.
- **Phalanges:** Each weight-bearing digit (II–V) has three phalanges—proximal, middle, and distal.
- **Sesamoids:** Small bones at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints; assist with tendon movement.

##Main Muscles##
- **Digital Flexors (Superficial and Deep):** Flex the toes and stabilize the paw.
- **Digital Extensors:** Extend the toes and aid in propulsion.
- **Interossei:** Small muscles between metacarpals that assist in flexion and pad movement.

##Function##
- Provides traction, grip, and shock absorption through pads and claws.
- Enables locomotion, manipulation, and balance.
- Supports body weight and aids in propulsion during gait.
- Allows flexion, extension, and slight rotation for stability on varied terrain.

#Superficial Pectoral Muscles#

The dog’s superficial pectoral muscles form the outer chest layer, connecting the sternum to the forelimb.  
They assist with adduction, support the forelimb, and influence upper body movement.  
Energetically, they represent **connection, empathy, and openness of the heart**.

###Parts###

##Descending Pectoral##  
Runs obliquely from the cranial sternum to the humerus.  
Energetically, symbolizes **initiative and movement from the heart**.

##Transverse Pectoral##  
Lies across the chest, pulling the limb inward for balance.  
Energetically, reflects **harmony between giving and receiving**.

###Function###  
Adducts and stabilizes the forelimb, supporting symmetrical motion.  
Energetically, aligns **heart energy with grounded strength**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: chest constriction or limited shoulder movement.  
Weakness: reduced limb coordination.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **emotional closure or guardedness**.

#Superficial Pectoral Muscles#

##Location##
Located on the **ventral chest**, forming the front portion of the thoracic musculature between the forelimbs.  
Comprises two parts — the **descending pectoral** and the **transverse pectoral** — which extend from the **cranial and mid-sternal regions** to the **humerus**.  
These muscles lie directly beneath the skin and cover the cranial thoracic wall.

###Shape###
Broad, flat muscles with fibers arranged in slightly different orientations.  
The descending pectoral runs obliquely from the manubrium to the humerus, while the transverse pectoral runs more horizontally across the lower chest.  
Together, they form a strong and flexible muscular sheet that merges medially with the contralateral side.

##Function##
Adduct the forelimbs toward the body’s midline and assist in **limb retraction** when the limb is advanced.  
Stabilize the **shoulder and forelimb** during standing and locomotion.  
When the limb is fixed, they assist in **drawing the trunk forward**, particularly during running or climbing.  
Support **balance, weight-bearing, and coordination** during stride transitions.  
Contribute to **shock absorption** and **limb alignment** in gait cycles.  
Work synergistically with the deep pectoral to control fine motion and provide postural stability in the shoulder girdle.

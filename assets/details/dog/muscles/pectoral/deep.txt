#Deep Pectoral Muscles#

The dog’s deep pectoral muscles lie beneath the superficial layer, extending from the sternum to the humerus.  
They draw the limb backward and inward, supporting the chest and contributing to propulsion.  
Energetically, they represent **inner power, stability, and trust in self**.

###Parts###

##Sternal Origin##  
Broad attachment to the sternum and adjacent ribs.  
Energetically, symbolizes **foundation and rootedness**.

##Humeral Insertion##  
Attaches to the lesser tubercle of the humerus.  
Energetically, reflects **connection and direction of energy**.

###Function###  
Retracts the forelimb, stabilizes the trunk, and aids forward thrust.  
Energetically, harmonizes **inner stability with grounded action**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted limb movement or chest stiffness.  
Weakness: poor posture or loss of forward drive.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **inner resistance or weakened confidence**.

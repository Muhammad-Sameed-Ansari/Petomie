#Deep Pectoral Muscle (Ascending Pectoral)#

##Location##
Lies beneath the superficial pectoral muscles on the **ventral thoracic floor**, originating from the **entire length of the sternum** and inserting onto the **greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus**.  
Forms the deepest and most powerful pectoral layer, extending caudally between the forelimbs.

###Shape###
Large, thick, fan-shaped muscle with a broad origin and a narrow humeral insertion.  
Fibers run dorsolaterally and cranially from the sternum to the humerus.  
The muscle is well-developed and provides major strength for forward propulsion and trunk suspension.

##Function##
Draws the limb **caudally and medially**, pulling it backward during propulsion.  
When the limb is fixed, pulls the **trunk forward** relative to the limb, aiding in forward motion.  
Acts as a **stabilizer of the shoulder joint** and helps maintain trunk elevation between the forelimbs.  
Works in conjunction with the **superficial pectorals** and **serratus ventralis** to support the thoracic sling.  
Essential for **climbing, jumping, and running**, providing both power and control.  
Also assists with **postural correction** and **shock absorption** when the dog lands or brakes.  
In static posture, contributes to **balance and weight distribution** across the chest and forelimbs.

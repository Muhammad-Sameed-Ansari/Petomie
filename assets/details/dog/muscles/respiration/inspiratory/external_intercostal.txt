#External Intercostal Muscles#

##Location##
Located between the ribs, extending from the **caudal border of one rib** to the **cranial border of the next**.  
Occupy the intercostal spaces except near the sternum.

###Shape###
Thin, flat sheets of muscle with **fibers running caudoventrally** (downward and forward).  
Lie superficial to the internal intercostal muscles.

##Function##
Assist **inspiration** by raising and rotating the ribs outward, expanding the thoracic cavity.  
Work synergistically with the diaphragm and stabilize the rib cage during breathing.

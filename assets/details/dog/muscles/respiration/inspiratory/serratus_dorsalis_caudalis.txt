#Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis#

The dog’s serratus dorsalis caudalis lies on the caudal thoracic region, aiding in expiration.  
It draws the ribs backward and downward to decrease thoracic volume.  
Energetically, it represents **release, grounding, and integration**.

###Parts###

##Caudal Fibers##  
Attach to lower ribs to assist exhalation.  
Energetically, symbolize **closure and grounding**.

##Fascial Anchors##  
Connect to the thoracolumbar fascia for support.  
Energetically, reflect **stability and endurance**.

###Function###  
Assists in active exhalation and stabilizes the thoracolumbar junction.  
Energetically, promotes **release and completion of energy cycles**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: reduced rib motion or restricted exhalation.  
Weakness: fatigue or shallow breath.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **difficulty releasing tension or emotions**.

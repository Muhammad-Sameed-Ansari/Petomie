#Abdominal Muscles of Respiration#

The dog’s abdominal muscles assist in active expiration by compressing the abdomen and pushing the diaphragm upward.  
They work in coordination with the intercostals to regulate breathing and stabilize the trunk.  
Energetically, they represent **release, grounding, and rhythmic flow**.

###Parts###

##Rectus Abdominis##  
Contracts to push air out of the lungs and support the spine.  
Energetically, symbolizes **focus and clarity in release**.

##Oblique Muscles##  
Assist in forced exhalation and trunk rotation.  
Energetically, reflect **balance, adaptability, and flow**.

##Transversus Abdominis##  
Provides core stability during breathing.  
Energetically, embodies **inner calm and centeredness**.

###Function###  
Compresses abdominal organs, supports expiration, and stabilizes posture.  
Energetically, supports **natural rhythm and grounded energy flow**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: shallow breathing or abdominal rigidity.  
Weakness: poor exhalation control or sagging back.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **resistance to release or internal pressure**.

#Throat Muscles#

##Location##
These muscles are found in the front of the neck, around the throat, voice box (larynx), and upper part of the windpipe (trachea).
They control swallowing, breathing, and vocal sounds and help support the tongue and airway.

##Shape##
They are thin, flat, and strap-like muscles that connect the chest, jaw, and throat.
Some lie on the surface, while others sit deeper around the larynx and pharynx (throat cavity).

##Parts##
###1. Sternohyoideus###
Runs from the chest bone (sternum) to the base of the tongue (hyoid bone).
Function: Pulls the tongue and larynx backward during swallowing.
###2. Sternothyroideus###
Lies beside the sternohyoideus.
Function: Pulls the larynx backward and helps protect the airway during swallowing.
###3. Thyrohyoideus###
Connects the voice box (thyroid cartilage) to the hyoid bone.
Function: Shortens the space between the larynx and hyoid to help with swallowing.
###4. Mylohyoideus###
Forms the floor of the mouth.
Function: Lifts the floor of the mouth and tongue when swallowing.
###5. Geniohyoideus###
Lies beneath the tongue.
Function: Pulls the hyoid bone and larynx forward to help food pass through the throat.
###6. Omohyoideus###
Thin muscle from the shoulder area to the hyoid.
Function: Moves the hyoid and throat backward and helps stabilize the neck during swallowing.
###7. Cricothyroideus###
On the surface of the larynx.
Function: Tightens the vocal cords and helps control sound and pitch.
###8. Cricoarytenoideus Dorsalis###
Located at the back of the larynx.
Function: Opens the airway by pulling the vocal cords apart for breathing.
###9. Cricoarytenoideus Lateralis###
On the side of the larynx.
Function: Closes the airway when swallowing or barking.
###10. Thyroarytenoideus###
Forms part of the vocal folds.
Function: Adjusts tension in the vocal cords to fine-tune the dog’s bark or growl.

##Function##
Swallowing: Moves the tongue, throat, and larynx to guide food safely into the esophagus.
Breathing: Controls how open or closed the airway is.
Vocalization: Adjusts and tightens the vocal cords to make sounds.
Protection: Prevents food or water from entering the lungs.
Support: Keeps the throat stable when the dog moves its head or neck.

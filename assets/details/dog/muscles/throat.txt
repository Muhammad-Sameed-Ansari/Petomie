#Throat Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the **neck and upper throat region**, connecting the **mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus**.  
These muscles surround the **airway and food passage**, controlling **swallowing, breathing, and vocalization**.

##Shape##
Made of **small paired muscles** arranged in layers around the **pharynx (throat)** and **larynx (voice box)**.  
They are mostly thin, strap-like, or circular, forming a coordinated muscular tube that moves food and controls airflow.

##Parts##

###1. Pharyngeal Constrictor Muscles###
- **Cricopharyngeus, Thyropharyngeus, Hyopharyngeus**  
- Form the outer wall of the pharynx.  
- **Function:** Contract in sequence to push food from the throat into the esophagus during swallowing.

###2. Palatine and Pterygopharyngeal Muscles###
- Located near the soft palate and upper pharynx.  
- **Function:** Raise or tense the soft palate and help close the nasal passage when swallowing.  

###3. Hyoid Muscles###
- Connect the **tongue, larynx, and base of skull** via the hyoid bones.  
- Include **geniohyoideus, sternohyoideus, and thyrohyoideus**.  
- **Function:** Move the tongue and larynx forward or backward during swallowing and breathing.  

###4. Laryngeal Muscles###
- Surround the **larynx (voice box)**.  
- Include **cricoarytenoideus dorsalis, cricoarytenoideus lateralis, thyroarytenoideus, and cricothyroideus**.  
- **Function:** Open and close the airway, adjust vocal cords for breathing and barking.  

###5. Sternothyroideus###
- Extends from sternum to thyroid cartilage of the larynx.  
- **Function:** Pulls larynx backward after swallowing.  

###6. Cricothyroideus###
- Connects cricoid and thyroid cartilages.  
- **Function:** Tenses the vocal cords, adjusting pitch of sound.  

##Function##
- **Swallowing:** Moves food from mouth to esophagus safely.  
- **Airway Control:** Opens or closes the larynx during breathing and prevents choking.  
- **Vocalization:** Adjusts vocal cords for barking and growling.  
- **Protection:** Closes airway during swallowing to prevent food from entering lungs.  
- **Coordination:** Works together with tongue and soft palate for smooth breathing and eating.

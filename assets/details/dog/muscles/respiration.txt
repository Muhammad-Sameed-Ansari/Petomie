#Respiration Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the thoracic and upper abdominal regions, surrounding the rib cage, sternum, and diaphragm.
These muscles form the mechanical framework responsible for inspiration and expiration, expanding and compressing the thoracic cavity to drive airflow through the lungs.

##Shape##
Composed of flat, intercostal muscles, the dome-shaped diaphragm, and supportive abdominal and thoracic structures.
Includes both inspiratory and expiratory muscle groups that act in rhythmic coordination.
In dogs, they are also adapted for panting, providing efficient cooling and oxygen exchange.

##Parts##
###1. Diaphragm###
Dome-shaped partition separating thoracic and abdominal cavities.
Origin: lumbar vertebrae, ribs, and sternum.
Insertion: central tendon.
Function: Contracts and flattens during inspiration to enlarge thoracic cavity; relaxes during expiration.
###2. External Intercostal Muscles###
Located between adjacent ribs with fibers running caudoventrally.
Function: Elevate ribs during inspiration, expanding the thoracic cavity.
###3. Internal Intercostal Muscles###
Deep to external intercostals; fibers run cranioventrally.
Function: Depress ribs during expiration, reducing thoracic volume.
###4. Serratus Dorsalis Cranialis###
Lies on the dorsolateral thorax.
Function: Elevates ribs to assist inspiration.
###5. Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis###
Caudal region of thoracic wall.
Function: Depresses ribs during expiration.
###6. Scalenus###
Extends from cervical vertebrae to the first few ribs.
Function: Stabilizes cranial ribs and aids inspiration.
###7. Rectus Thoracis###
Small muscle along the first rib.
Function: Elevates the first ribs during inspiration.
###8. Transversus Thoracis###
Inner ventral surface of the thoracic wall.
Function: Draws ribs downward during expiration.
###9. Abdominal Muscles###
(Assist in forced expiration and trunk stabilization.)
External Abdominal Oblique: Compresses abdomen and pushes viscera against diaphragm.
Internal Abdominal Oblique: Assists in forced expiration and flexes trunk.
Transversus Abdominis: Compresses abdominal viscera and supports trunk.
Rectus Abdominis: Aids in expiration and posture control.

##Function##
Inspiration: Diaphragm and external intercostals contract to expand the thoracic cavity.
Expiration: Internal intercostals and abdominal muscles contract to expel air.
Panting: Rapid shallow breaths for cooling and oxygen regulation.
Support: Maintain thoracic stability and assist posture.
Protection: Safeguard thoracic organs and assist in pressure regulation.

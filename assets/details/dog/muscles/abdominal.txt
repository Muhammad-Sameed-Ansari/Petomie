#Abdominal Muscles#

##Location##
Located along the ventral and lateral walls of the abdomen, extending from the thoracic cage to the pelvis.
These muscles form the abdominal wall, enclosing and supporting the internal organs while contributing to respiration, posture, and movement.

##Shape##
Composed of broad, flat, overlapping muscle layers that run in different directions.
This multi-layered structure provides strength, flexibility, and effective compression of the abdominal cavity.
Together, they form a muscular sheath enclosing the viscera and maintaining core stability.

##Parts##
###1. External Abdominal Oblique###
Outermost and largest abdominal muscle.
Fibers run caudoventrally from the ribs and thoracolumbar fascia to the linea alba and pubis.
Function: Compresses the abdomen, flexes and laterally bends the trunk, assists expiration and supports viscera.
###2. Internal Abdominal Oblique###
Lies deep to the external oblique.
Fibers run cranioventrally from thoracolumbar fascia and iliac crest to linea alba.
Function: Compresses abdominal contents, flexes and rotates the trunk, and helps maintain posture.
###3. Transversus Abdominis###
Deepest abdominal muscle layer.
Fibers run transversely from ribs and lumbar vertebrae to the linea alba.
Function: Compresses the abdominal viscera, stabilizes the spine, and controls intra-abdominal pressure.
###4. Rectus Abdominis###
Long, paired, strap-like muscle running along the ventral midline.
Origin: sternum and costal cartilages.
Insertion: pubic symphysis.
Function: Flexes the trunk, supports the abdomen, assists in respiration, and stabilizes the pelvis.
###5. Cremaster (in males)###
Thin slip of muscle derived from the internal oblique, surrounding the spermatic cord.
Function: Raises and lowers the testes for thermoregulation.
###6. Linea Alba###
Fibrous midline seam joining left and right abdominal muscles.
Extends from the xiphoid cartilage to the pubis.
Function: Provides central attachment and strength to the abdominal wall.

##Function##
Support: Maintains organ position and abdominal wall integrity.
Compression: Increases internal pressure for urination, defecation, and parturition.
Flexion: Bends the trunk and stabilizes posture.
Respiration: Aids expiration by pushing viscera upward against the diaphragm.
Protection: Shields internal organs and maintains trunk stability during movement.

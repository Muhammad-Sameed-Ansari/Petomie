#Hypaxial Muscles#

The dog’s hypaxial muscles lie **beneath the transverse processes** of the vertebrae.  
They flex the spine, support breathing, and aid in postural control.  
Energetically, they represent **support, flexibility, and connection between inner and outer strength**.

###Parts###

##Psoas Major##  
Connects lumbar spine to femur, flexing hip and spine.  
Energetically, symbolizes **movement initiation and grounded power**.

##Iliacus##  
Broad muscle joining the psoas at the femur.  
Energetically, reflects **fluid grace and balance**.

##Quadratus Lumborum##  
Stabilizes lumbar region and aids lateral bending.  
Energetically, embodies **stability and emotional grounding**.

###Function###  
Flex and stabilize the spine, connect trunk and hindquarters, and support breathing.  
Energetically, they integrate **core support with emotional release**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: shortened stride, restricted hip flexion.  
Weakness: instability or poor core control.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **fear of movement or lack of energetic flexibility**.

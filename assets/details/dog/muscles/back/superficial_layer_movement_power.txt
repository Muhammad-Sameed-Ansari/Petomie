#Superficial Layer (Movement and Power)#

##Location##
Forms the **outermost muscle layer** of the dog’s body, covering the trunk, neck, and limbs.  
Responsible for the **visible strength, movement, and agility** that characterize canine locomotion.

##Shape##
Made of **large, powerful muscles** that generate force for propulsion and movement.  
They are long and well-developed, providing both speed and endurance.

##Parts##

###1. Trapezius###
- Thin, triangular muscle over the neck and shoulders.  
- **Function:** Elevates and rotates scapula, aiding limb movement.  

###2. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Large, flat muscle along the sides and back.  
- **Function:** Pulls the limb backward and assists in climbing or running.  

###3. Gluteal Muscles###
- Over the hip and rump region.  
- **Function:** Extend and abduct the hip; key drivers in running and jumping.  

###4. Quadriceps Femoris###
- Large muscle group on the front of the thigh.  
- **Function:** Extends the stifle (knee) and provides limb support during stance.  

###5. Hamstring Group (Biceps Femoris, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus)###
- Located at the back of the thigh.  
- **Function:** Extend the hip and propel the body forward.  

###6. Pectoral Muscles###
- Chest muscles connecting forelimb to sternum.  
- **Function:** Adduct the forelimb and assist in stabilization during movement.  

##Function##
- **Movement and Power:** Produces the main force for walking, running, and jumping.  
- **Propulsion:** Generates forward motion and acceleration.  
- **Agility:** Allows rapid changes in direction and body control.  
- **Strength Integration:** Works with intermediate and deep layers for smooth, powerful motion.

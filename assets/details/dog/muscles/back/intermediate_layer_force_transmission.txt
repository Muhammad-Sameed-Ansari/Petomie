#Intermediate Layer (Force Transmission and Coordination)#

##Location##
Lies between the **deep core muscles** and the **outer power muscles**, connecting the **spine, ribs, and pelvis** to the limbs.  
Acts as the **transmission system** that links core stability with limb movement for smooth, coordinated motion.

##Shape##
Composed of **medium-depth, elongated muscles** that run along the trunk and neck.  
They bridge the body’s midline, transferring energy between front and hind limbs during walking, running, or jumping.

##Parts##

###1. Internal Oblique###
- Lies beneath the external oblique on the abdomen.  
- **Function:** Flexes and rotates the trunk, supports internal organs, and transfers movement forces.  

###2. Longissimus Dorsi###
- Extends along the spine from pelvis to neck.  
- **Function:** Extends, supports, and stabilizes the back; transmits hindlimb power forward.  

###3. Iliocostalis###
- Runs along the ribs and lumbar area.  
- **Function:** Helps in posture and lateral bending of the spine.  

###4. Latissimus Dorsi###
- Broad muscle along the side of the trunk.  
- **Function:** Retracts the forelimb and contributes to forward thrust during motion.  

###5. External Oblique###
- Outermost abdominal muscle.  
- **Function:** Compresses the abdomen and aids trunk rotation and lateral flexion.  

##Function##
- **Force Transmission:** Connects hindquarter propulsion with forelimb reach.  
- **Coordination:** Synchronizes movement between spine and limbs.  
- **Stability:** Maintains body alignment during motion.  
- **Support:** Works with deep muscles for balance and control.

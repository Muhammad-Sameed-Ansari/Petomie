#Intermediate Layer – Force Transmission#

The intermediate back muscles bridge the deep stabilizers and the superficial movers.  
They transmit power from the hindquarters to the forelimbs, ensuring smooth energy flow through the spine.  
Energetically, they represent **coordination, flow, and integration of strength**.

###Parts###

##Longissimus Dorsi##  
Runs the full spine length; primary extensor of the back.  
Energetically, symbolizes **endurance and strength in motion**.

##Iliocostalis##  
Connects pelvis to ribs, aiding lateral bending and trunk stability.  
Energetically, represents **balance between flexibility and control**.

###Function###  
Transfers power between hindquarters and forehand, supports lifting and propulsion.  
Energetically, harmonizes **movement and direction**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: stiffness or shortened stride.  
Weakness: sagging back or reduced drive.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of flow or blocked energy movement**.

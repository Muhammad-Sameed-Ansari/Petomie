#Deep Layer – Core Stability#

The dog’s deep back muscles form the **structural foundation** of the spine, providing stabilization and alignment.  
They maintain posture, balance vertebral motion, and support controlled bending and extension.  
Energetically, they represent **inner strength, grounding, and resilience under pressure**.

###Parts###

##Multifidus##  
Small, deep muscles spanning several vertebrae, stabilizing each segment of the spine.  
Energetically, reflect **fine control and structural awareness**.

##Rotatores##  
Assist in subtle spinal rotation and proprioception.  
Energetically, symbolize **precision and adaptability**.

##Interspinales##  
Short muscles connecting adjacent vertebrae, supporting extension and posture.  
Energetically, embody **balance and centered endurance**.

###Function###  
Stabilize the vertebral column, prevent excessive motion, and protect the spinal cord.  
Energetically, they anchor **core strength and aligned purpose**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: stiffness or restricted back motion.  
Weakness: spinal instability or poor posture.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **insecurity, imbalance, or suppressed drive**.

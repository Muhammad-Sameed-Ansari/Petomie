#Deep Layer (Core Stability and Alignment)#

##Location##
Located deep within the **abdominal, spinal, and pelvic regions** of the dog.  
These muscles form the **core support system**, surrounding the spine and maintaining stability, balance, and posture during movement.  
They lie beneath the intermediate and superficial layers, connecting the **pelvis, spine, and ribcage**.

##Shape##
Composed of **short, dense, and layered muscles** close to the vertebral column and pelvic bones.  
They are not visible externally but play a vital role in fine motor control, posture, and core strength.

##Parts##

###1. Multifidus###
- Small, overlapping muscles along the spine from sacrum to neck.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes vertebrae, fine-tunes spinal movement, and maintains alignment.

###2. Transversus Abdominis###
- Deepest abdominal layer encircling the trunk like a corset.  
- **Function:** Compresses the abdomen and supports the spine during locomotion and balance.

###3. Psoas Major###
- Originates from lumbar vertebrae and inserts on the femur.  
- **Function:** Flexes hip joint and stabilizes lower back and pelvis when walking or running.

###4. Iliacus###
- Lies beside the psoas, joining it near the femur.  
- **Function:** Aids hip flexion and pelvic balance.  

###5. Quadratus Lumborum###
- Runs from pelvis to lumbar spine.  
- **Function:** Stabilizes lower back and controls side bending and spinal extension.  

###6. Diaphragm###
- Dome-shaped muscle separating thoracic and abdominal cavities.  
- **Function:** Coordinates breathing with core engagement and trunk stabilization.  

##Function##
- **Core Stability:** Maintains spinal and pelvic alignment during motion and rest.  
- **Postural Support:** Keeps body upright and balanced.  
- **Movement Coordination:** Links hindlimb propulsion with forelimb reach for efficient gait.  
- **Protection:** Shields internal organs by maintaining intra-abdominal pressure.  
- **Breathing Integration:** Works with diaphragm to balance respiration and movement.

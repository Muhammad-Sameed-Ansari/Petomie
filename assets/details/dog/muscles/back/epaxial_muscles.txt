#Epaxial Muscles#

The dog’s epaxial muscles lie **above the transverse processes of the vertebrae**, forming the main extensor group of the back.  
They maintain topline shape, lift the back, and stabilize the spine during motion.  
Energetically, they represent **strength, elevation, and resilience through alignment**.

###Parts###

##Longissimus##  
Extends the spine, aids lateral flexion.  
Energetically, represents **power and upward motion**.

##Iliocostalis##  
Links pelvis and ribs, assisting in breathing and posture.  
Energetically, embodies **rhythmic flow and vitality**.

##Spinalis##  
Deepest extensor maintaining vertebral tension.  
Energetically, reflects **support and steadfastness**.

###Function###  
Support and extend the back, maintain alignment, and stabilize during collection.  
Energetically, link **physical balance with energetic lift**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: hollow back, tension, or stiffness.  
Weakness: topline drop, poor self-carriage.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **loss of strength or lowered vitality**.

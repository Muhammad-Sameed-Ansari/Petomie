#Abdominal Middle Layer#

The middle abdominal layer provides **rotational and lateral control** of the trunk.  
It coordinates with the diaphragm and intercostal muscles for smooth breathing and motion.  
Energetically, it represents **adaptability and flow in action**.

###Parts###

##Internal Oblique##  
Fibers running upward and forward, stabilizing the ribs and pelvis.  
Supports twisting and flexion of the trunk.  
Energetically, embodies **inner adaptability and protective flow**.

##Middle Fascia##  
Blends with outer and deep layers for core strength.  
Energetically, reflects **balance between movement and containment**.

###Function###  
Supports lateral bending, trunk stability, and balance during gait.  
Energetically, promotes **fluid motion and emotional flexibility**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Tightness: restricted side bending.  
Weakness: imbalance in turning or gait.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **rigidity or suppressed adaptability**.

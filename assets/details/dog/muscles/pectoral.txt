#Pectoral Muscles#

##Location##
The pectoral muscles of the dog are located on the ventral (underside) region of the thorax between the forelimbs.
They connect the sternum to the humerus and shoulder region, forming the muscular chest that supports and moves the forelimbs.

##Shape##
Composed of two main paired muscle groups—superficial and deep—both broad, flat, and fan-shaped.
These muscles vary in thickness, covering the sternum and cranial thorax, and taper laterally to insert on the forelimb.

##Main Muscles##
- **Superficial Pectoral Muscles (Descending and Transverse Parts):**
  - Located on the cranial chest, extending from the first few sternebrae to the humerus.
  - The descending part runs obliquely downward and outward; the transverse part lies deeper and runs horizontally.
  - **Function:** Adducts the forelimb (pulls it toward the midline) and assists in protraction.

- **Deep Pectoral Muscle (Ascending Pectoral):**
  - Lies beneath the superficial pectorals; originates from the entire length of the sternum and inserts on the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus.
  - **Function:** Retracts the forelimb and draws the trunk forward when the limb is fixed; supports the thorax during movement.

- **Subclavius (in some breeds, vestigial or absent):**
  - Small, thin muscle near the cranial edge of the deep pectoral; assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint.

##Function##
- Adduct the forelimbs, pulling them toward the body’s midline.
- Support the weight of the trunk between the forelimbs.
- Aid in protraction and retraction of the forelimb during locomotion.
- Stabilize the shoulder and assist in absorbing impact during landing and stance.
- Play a role in drawing the trunk forward when the limb is fixed to the ground.

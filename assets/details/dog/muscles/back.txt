#Back Muscles (Epaxial)#

##Location##
Located along the dorsal aspect of the trunk, extending from the neck (cervical region) to the sacrum.
These muscles form the top line of the dog and connect the vertebral column to the ribs, pelvis, and limbs, playing a major role in posture, stability, and locomotion.

##Shape##
Composed of long, multilayered muscle groups, arranged longitudinally on either side of the spine.
They are divided into superficial and deep layers, running parallel to the vertebral column to provide both powerful extension and fine postural control.

##Parts##
###1. Longissimus Dorsi###
Largest and most powerful epaxial muscle.
Extends from the ilium and sacrum to the neck.
Function: Extends, stabilizes, and laterally flexes the vertebral column; supports the back during running and jumping.
###2. Iliocostalis###
Lateral to the longissimus.
Runs from the ilium to the ribs.
Function: Extends and laterally bends the spine; stabilizes ribs during breathing.
###3. Spinalis et Multifidus###
Deep layer close to the vertebrae.
Connects spinous and transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae.
Function: Stabilizes the spine, controls fine posture, and aids in local adjustments of vertebral alignment.
###4. Serratus Dorsalis Cranialis###
Thin sheet of muscle on the upper thoracic region.
Function: Elevates ribs to assist inspiration.
###5. Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis###
Caudal portion of the thoracic wall.
Function: Depresses ribs during expiration.
###6. Latissimus Dorsi###
Broad superficial muscle on the lateral back.
Origin: thoracolumbar fascia and spinous processes.
Insertion: humerus.
Function: Draws forelimb backward, flexes shoulder, and assists trunk movement.
###7. Intertransversarii###
Small deep muscles between transverse processes.
Function: Stabilize vertebrae and assist in lateral bending of the spine.
###8. Interspinales###
Tiny paired muscles between spinous processes.
Function: Aid in extending and stabilizing the vertebral column.
###9. Thoracolumbar Fascia###
Dense fibrous sheath covering the epaxial muscles.
Function: Provides mechanical support, transmits force between trunk and limbs, and protects underlying muscles.

##Function##
Extension: Straightens and arches the back.
Flexion (lateral): Allows side bending and balance during movement.
Stabilization: Maintains posture and spinal alignment.
Locomotion: Transmits power from hindquarters to forequarters.
Respiration: Assists rib motion during breathing.

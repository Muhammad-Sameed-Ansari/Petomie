#Muscles of Respiration â€“ Inspiratory#

##Location##
Located on the cranial thoracic wall, dorsolateral thorax, and diaphragm. These muscles expand the thoracic cavity to draw air into the lungs.

##Shape##
Thin, sheet-like muscles between the ribs and fan-shaped muscles on the thorax. Includes the dome-shaped diaphragm.

##Parts##
###1. Diaphragm###
Dome-shaped muscle separating thorax and abdomen
Primary muscle of inspiration
Contracts and flattens to increase thoracic volume
###2. External Intercostals###
Run obliquely between ribs
Pull ribs forward and upward
Expand thoracic cavity
###3. Serratus Dorsalis Cranialis###
Lies on dorsolateral thorax
Draws ribs cranially
Assists in inspiration
###4. Scalenus###
Runs from cervical vertebrae to first few ribs
Pulls cranial ribs forward
Stabilizes thoracic inlet during breathing
###5. Levator Costarum###
Small muscles from transverse processes to ribs
Elevate ribs, aiding inspiration

##Function##
Increase thoracic volume by elevating ribs and flattening diaphragm
Create negative pressure to draw air into the lungs

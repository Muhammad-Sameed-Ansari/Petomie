#Muscles of Respiration â€“ Expiratory#

##Location##
Located on the caudal thoracic wall and abdominal wall. These muscles compress the thoracic cavity to push air out of the lungs.

##Shape##
Thin, sheet-like muscles between ribs and flat abdominal muscles that increase intra-abdominal pressure.

##Parts##
###1. Internal Intercostals###
Deep to external intercostals
Pull ribs caudally
Reduce thoracic cavity volume
###2. Serratus Dorsalis Caudalis###
Located on caudal thoracic wall
Draws ribs caudally
Assists in expiration
###3. Retractor Costae###
Small muscle between last rib and lumbar vertebra
Pulls last rib caudally during expiration
###4. Abdominal Muscles (Rectus Abdominis, Internal/External Obliques, Transversus Abdominis)###
Compress abdominal cavity
Push diaphragm cranially
Force air out during active expiration

##Function##
Decrease thoracic volume
Push air out of lungs during active or forced expiration
Support coughing, sneezing, and vocalization

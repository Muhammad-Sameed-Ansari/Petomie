#Medial & Cranial Thigh Muscles#

##Location##
Located on the medial and cranial sides of the thigh. These muscles are responsible for adduction, stifle extension, and precise control of hindlimb movement.

##Shape##
Includes strap-like, flat, and powerful extensor muscles that stabilize the limb and support weight-bearing.

##Parts##
###1. Sartorius (cranial and caudal parts)###
Thin strap-like muscle on medial thigh
Cranial part – flexes hip and extends stifle
Caudal part – flexes stifle
###2. Gracilis###
Broad, flat medial thigh muscle
Adducts limb
Flexes stifle and extends hip and tarsus
###3. Pectineus###
Small medial muscle
Adducts limb
Assists in hip flexion
###4. Adductor (longus, magnus, brevis)###
Large medial muscle group
Adducts pelvic limb
Supports body weight during stance
###5. Quadriceps Femoris###
(rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius)
Main extensor of stifle
Rectus femoris also flexes hip
Crucial for weight-bearing and propulsion
###6. External Obturator###
Small muscle from ventral pelvis
Laterally rotates femur
Stabilizes hip joint
###7. Internal Obturator###
Arises from inner pelvis
Laterally rotates femur
Stabilizes hip joint
###8. Gemelli###
Pair of small muscles near ischium
Laterally rotate femur
Assist obturators
###9. Quadratus Femoris###
Short, thick muscle caudal to hip
Extends hip
Rotates femur laterally

##Function##
Adduct the limb to maintain balance and prevent splaying
Extend the stifle for weight support and forward movement
Assist in precise limb positioning during walking, running, and turning

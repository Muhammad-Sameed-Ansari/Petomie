#Gluteal & Hamstring Muscles#

##Location##
Located on the lateral and caudal aspects of the pelvis and thigh. These muscles provide the main propulsive power for the hindlimbs, controlling hip extension, abduction, and limb retraction.

##Shape##
Large, strong muscle groups including the gluteals and hamstrings, forming the bulk of the hindquarter.

##Parts##
###1. Superficial Gluteal###
Smallest of the gluteal muscles
Extends hip
Abducts hindlimb
###2. Middle Gluteal###
Largest gluteal muscle
Extends and abducts hip
Rotates pelvic limb medially
###3. Deep Gluteal###
Lies beneath middle gluteal
Abducts limb
Stabilizes hip joint
###4. Tensor Fasciae Latae###
Triangular muscle on lateral thigh
Flexes hip
Tenses fascia lata and extends stifle via patellar ligament
###5. Biceps Femoris###
Largest hamstring muscle
Extends hip, stifle, and tarsus
Flexes stifle when limb is non-weight-bearing
###6. Semitendinosus###
Caudal thigh muscle
Extends hip and tarsus
Flexes stifle
###7. Semimembranosus###
Medial to semitendinosus
Extends hip
Flexes or extends stifle depending on limb position

##Function##
Provide the main driving force for running, jumping, and climbing
Extend the hip and tarsus, and stabilize the stifle
Control limb abduction and medial rotation of the thigh

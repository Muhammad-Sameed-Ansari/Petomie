#Pectoral Muscles â€“ Superficial#

##Location##
Located on the cranial and ventral thorax, lying directly under the skin and covering the cranial chest wall. These are the most superficial chest muscles attaching the sternum to the humerus.

##Shape##
Flat, thin muscles forming the outer layer of the pectoral region.

##Parts##
###1. Descending Pectoral###
Most cranial of the superficial pectorals
Origin: Cranial sternum
Insertion: Crest of the greater tubercle of the humerus
Adducts forelimb
Assists in protraction when limb is non-weight-bearing
###2. Transverse Pectoral###
Caudal to the descending pectoral
Origin: Cranial half of the sternum
Insertion: Crest of the greater tubercle of the humerus (caudal to descending pectoral)
Adducts forelimb
Provides trunk stability during stance

##Function##
Adduct the forelimbs to keep them close to the body
Assist in moving the limb forward when not weight-bearing
Stabilize the limb during standing and walking

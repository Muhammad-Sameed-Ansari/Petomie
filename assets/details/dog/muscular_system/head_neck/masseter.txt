#Head & Neck Muscles#

##Location##
Throat
Located on the head and cervical (neck) region. These muscles control jaw movement, facial expression, head and neck positioning, and assist with swallowing and breathing.

##Shape##
Varies from large strap-like muscles (sternocephalicus) to flat fan-shaped muscles (temporalis, splenius) and thin sheet-like muscles (trapezius, buccinator). Together, they form a complex network that moves the head, neck, jaw, and lips.

##Parts##
###1. Masseter###
Powerful jaw-closing muscle
Elevates the mandible and brings teeth together for chewing
Provides most of the force for mastication
###2. Temporalis###
Large fan-shaped muscle over the temporal bone
Elevates the mandible and retracts it slightly
Works with masseter for strong jaw closure
###3. Digastricus###
Long muscle running along the ventral jaw
Opens the mouth by depressing the mandible
Acts as the antagonist to masseter and temporalis
###4. Buccinator###
Thin cheek muscle
Compresses the cheek against teeth
Keeps food positioned between teeth during chewing
###5. Orbicularis oculi###
Circular muscle surrounding the eye
Closes the eyelids for blinking, winking, and eye protection
###6. Orbicularis oris###
Circular muscle surrounding the lips
Closes and puckers lips
Controls lip movement for prehension and grooming
###7. Sternocephalicus###
Runs from sternum to skull
Flexes head and neck ventrally
Turns the head when acting on one side
###8. Sternohyoideus###
Runs from sternum to hyoid apparatus
Pulls tongue and larynx caudally
Aids swallowing
###9. Sternothyroideus###
Deep to sternohyoideus
Draws larynx caudally during swallowing and vocalization
###10. Omotransversarius###
Narrow strap-like muscle from wing of atlas to scapular spine
Draws the forelimb cranially (protraction)
Bends neck laterally when limb is fixed
###11. Brachiocephalicus (cleidocephalicus, cleidobrachialis)###
Extends from head/neck to humerus
Advances the forelimb and extends shoulder joint
Flexes neck laterally when limb is fixed
###12. Splenius###
Broad dorsal neck muscle
Extends and raises head and neck
Bends head laterally when acting unilaterally
###13. Longus capitis###
Deep cervical muscle to base of skull
Flexes atlanto-occipital joint, lowering the head
###14. Longus colli###
Ventral neck muscle spanning several vertebrae
Flexes cervical spine and stabilizes neck during motion
###15. Scalenus###
Runs from cervical vertebrae to first few ribs
Flexes neck when acting bilaterally
Draws cranial ribs forward to aid inspiration
###16. Rhomboideus (capitis, cervicis, thoracis)###
Thick muscle group attaching scapula to midline
Elevates the limb and pulls scapula toward body
Stabilizes shoulder girdle
###17. Trapezius (cervicis, thoracis)###
Thin triangular sheet over neck and shoulder
Elevates and abducts the scapula
Assists in protraction of forelimb
###18. Serratus ventralis (cervicis, thoracis)###
Large fan-shaped muscle suspending trunk between scapulae
Supports the body weight
Moves scapula cranially or caudally and assists in respiration

##Function##
Collectively, these muscles coordinate chewing, swallowing, facial expression, head/neck flexion and extension, and limb movement at the shoulder. They also stabilize the trunk between the forelimbs and assist with respiration.

#Antebrachium & Paw Muscles – Extensors & Supinators#

##Location##
Located on the cranial and lateral aspect of the forearm, running from the humerus and radius/ulna to the carpus and digits.

##Shape##
Long, slender muscles with tendons that cross the carpus and digits dorsally, allowing extension and supination.

##Parts##
###1. Extensor Carpi Radialis###
Cranial forearm muscle
Extends the carpus (wrist)
Supports limb during stance
###2. Common Digital Extensor###
Lies lateral to extensor carpi radialis
Extends digits II–V and carpus
###3. Lateral Digital Extensor###
Caudal to common digital extensor
Extends digits III–V
Stabilizes paw during extension
###4. Ulnaris Lateralis###
Caudolateral forearm muscle
Flexes carpus (despite its name)
Stabilizes during weight-bearing
###5. Supinator###
Cranial lateral forearm muscle
Supinates paw (rotates forelimb outward)

##Function##
Extend carpus and digits to place paw forward
Support weight-bearing phase of gait
Supinate paw for correct placement and balance

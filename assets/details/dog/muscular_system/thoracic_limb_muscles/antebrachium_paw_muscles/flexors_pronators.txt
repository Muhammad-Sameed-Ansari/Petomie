(Humeral & ulnar heads)
Flexes carpus
###2. Flexor Carpi Radialis###
Medial forearm muscle

###3. Superficial Digital Flexor###
Caudal forearm muscle
Flexes carpus and digits II–V
###4. Deep Digital Flexor###
(Humeral, radial, ulnar heads)
Deep caudal forearm muscle

Small craniomedial muscle
Pronates paw (rotates forelimb inward)
###6. Pronator Quadratus###
Flat muscle between radius and ulna

Stabilizes interosseous space

##Function##
Flex carpus and digits for shock absorption and grip
Allow paw to push off during propulsion phase of gait
Pronate paw for rotational control and proper stance

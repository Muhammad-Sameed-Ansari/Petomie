#Crus & Pes Muscles – Cranial & Lateral (Extensor) Group#

##Location##
Located on the cranial and lateral sides of the crus, extending into the paw. These muscles flex the tarsus (hock) and extend the digits, allowing paw placement during locomotion.

##Shape##
Long, narrow muscles on the front and lateral aspects of the leg, tapering into tendons that run under extensor retinacula to the paw.

##Parts##
###1. Cranial Tibial###
Cranial aspect of tibia
Flexes tarsus
Rotates paw laterally (supinates pes)
###2. Long Digital Extensor###
Cranial crus muscle
Extends digits II–V
Flexes tarsus
###3. Lateral Digital Extensor###
Runs beside long digital extensor
Extends digit V
Assists in paw stabilization
###4. Peroneus Longus###
Lateral crus muscle
Flexes tarsus
Pronates pes (rotates paw medially)
###5. Peroneus Brevis###
Shorter lateral muscle
Flexes tarsus
Stabilizes paw in stance

##Function##
Flex tarsus to lift paw during swing phase
Extend digits for paw placement
Aid in steering, balance, and precise foot positioning during locomotion

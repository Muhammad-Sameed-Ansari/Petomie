#Laryngeal Muscles â€“ Adductors & Relaxers#

##Location##
Located on the lateral and ventral larynx. These muscles close or narrow the glottis and relax vocal cords.

##Shape##
Short paired or unpaired muscles controlling airway closure and vocal fold relaxation.

##Parts##
###1. Cricoarytenoideus Lateralis###
Adducts arytenoid cartilages
Closes glottis during swallowing
###2. Thyroarytenoideus###
Relaxes vocal cords
Lowers pitch of sound
Helps partially close glottis
###3. Vocalis###
Part of thyroarytenoideus
Fine-tunes vocal fold tension
###4. Arytenoideus Transversus###
Unpaired muscle crossing between arytenoids
Closes rima glottidis by bringing arytenoids together

##Function##
Close glottis to protect airway during swallowing
Relax vocal cords for deep-pitched sounds
Assist in controlled airflow during vocalization

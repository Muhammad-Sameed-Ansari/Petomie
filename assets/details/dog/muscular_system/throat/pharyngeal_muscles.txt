#Pharyngeal Muscles#

##Location##
Form the muscular walls of the pharynx, surrounding the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.

##Shape##
Circular constrictor muscles and thin dilator muscles that control the pharyngeal diameter.

##Parts##
###1. Pharyngeal Constrictors###
(Cricopharyngeus, Thyropharyngeus, Hyopharyngeus)
Contract sequentially to propel food bolus from pharynx into esophagus
###2. Pharyngeal Dilators###
Thin muscles that widen the pharynx
Facilitate air passage during breathing
Prepare pharynx for swallowing

##Function##
Contract to move food bolus during swallowing
Dilate to allow breathing between swallows
Coordinate with hyoid muscles for safe passage of food and air

#Hyoid Muscles#

##Location##
Located in the throat region, attaching to the hyoid apparatus and larynx. These muscles control tongue and laryngeal movement by positioning the hyoid apparatus cranially or caudally.

##Shape##
Thin, strap-like muscles forming the floor of the mouth and connecting the hyoid to the sternum, thyroid cartilage, and mandible.

##Parts##
###1. Mylohyoideus###
Forms the muscular floor of the mouth
Supports tongue and raises it during swallowing
###2. Geniohyoideus###
Lies along midline between mandibles, deep to mylohyoideus
Draws hyoid apparatus cranially
Aids in swallowing and laryngeal elevation
###3. Sternohyoideus###
Runs from sternum to basihyoid bone
Pulls hyoid apparatus caudally after swallowing
###4. Sternothyroideus###
Runs from sternum to thyroid cartilage
Pulls larynx caudally
Assists in vocalization adjustments
###5. Thyrohyoideus###
Connects thyroid cartilage to hyoid apparatus
Shortens distance between larynx and hyoid
Elevates larynx during swallowing

##Function##
Move hyoid apparatus forward or backward
Elevate and stabilize tongue during swallowing
Adjust laryngeal position for breathing, swallowing, and vocalization

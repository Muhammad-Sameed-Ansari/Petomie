#Epaxial Muscles (Spinal Extensors)#

##Location##
Located dorsal (above) to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, running along the length of the spine from the sacrum to the skull.

##Shape##
Long, parallel muscle columns arranged in three main systems on each side of the vertebral column. These are the primary extensors of the back.

##Parts##
###1. Iliocostalis System###
Most lateral epaxial muscle group
Extends from ilium to cervical vertebrae
Extends the vertebral column and aids in lateral flexion
###2. Longissimus System###
Largest epaxial muscle group, lying between iliocostalis and transversospinalis
Subdivided into longissimus thoracis et lumborum, longissimus cervicis, longissimus capitis
Extends vertebral column, stabilizes spine, raises and turns head
###3. Transversospinalis System###
Most medial epaxial muscle group, close to spinous processes
Includes spinalis, semispinalis, multifidus
Stabilizes vertebrae, extends neck and back, provides fine control of vertebral motion

##Function##
Extend and stabilize the spine during movement
Raise head and neck when acting bilaterally
Provide lateral bending when acting unilaterally
Support posture and resist gravity

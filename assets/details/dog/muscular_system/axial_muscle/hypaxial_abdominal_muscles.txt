#Hypaxial & Abdominal Muscles (Spinal Flexors & Core)#

##Location##
Located ventral (below) to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, including the muscles of the thorax, abdomen, and ventral neck.

##Shape##
Flat, broad muscle sheets (abdominals, intercostals) and strap-like ventral neck muscles. They support viscera, flex the spine, and control breathing.

##Parts##
###1. Longus Colli###
Runs along ventral cervical vertebrae
Flexes neck and stabilizes cervical spine
###2. Longus Capitis###
Runs from cervical vertebrae to skull
Flexes atlanto-occipital joint, lowering head
###3. Scalenus###
Runs from cervical vertebrae to first ribs
Flexes neck and draws cranial ribs forward (inspiration)
###4. External Intercostals###
Run between ribs
Draw ribs forward to expand thoracic cavity (inspiration)
###5. Internal Intercostals###
Deep to external intercostals
Draw ribs backward to reduce thoracic volume (expiration)
###6. Rectus Abdominis###
Long strap muscle on ventral midline
Flexes lumbar spine
Supports abdominal wall
###7. External Abdominal Oblique###
Most superficial abdominal muscle
Compresses abdominal cavity
Flexes and laterally bends spine
###8. Internal Abdominal Oblique###
Deep to external oblique
Compresses abdominal cavity
Supports trunk rotation and lateral flexion
###9. Transversus Abdominis###
Deepest abdominal muscle
Runs transversely
Compresses abdominal contents, stabilizes core
###10. Diaphragm###
Dome-shaped muscle separating thorax and abdomen
Primary muscle of inspiration
Flattens during contraction to draw air into lungs

##Function##
Flex and stabilize the spine and neck
Support and compress abdominal organs
Assist with respiration (inspiration and expiration)
Provide core stability and protect internal viscera

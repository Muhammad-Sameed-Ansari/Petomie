#Vestibular Structures#

The vestibular system in the dog maintains balance, coordination, and spatial orientation.  
It allows smooth motion, posture control, and alignment with the earth’s gravity.  
Energetically, it represents **stability, grounding, and equilibrium between motion and stillness**.

###Parts###

##Semicircular Canals##  
Detect rotational movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **adaptability and flow**.

##Utricle and Saccule##  
Sense linear acceleration and gravity.  
Energetically, reflect **balance and orientation in life**.

##Vestibular Nerve##  
Transmits information from the inner ear to the brain.  
Energetically, represents **communication between body and awareness**.

###Function###  
Controls coordination, posture, and movement through spatial awareness.  
Energetically, harmonizes motion with stillness, supporting **confidence, calm, and grounded flow**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Head tilting, dizziness, or loss of balance.  
Energetically, imbalance may manifest as **confusion, instability, or loss of grounding**.

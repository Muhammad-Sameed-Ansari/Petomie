#Vestibular Structures#

##Location##
The vestibular system is located within the inner ear, inside the temporal bone of the skull.
It lies next to the cochlea (hearing organ) and connects to the brainstem and cerebellum through the vestibular nerve.
It also communicates with the eyes, neck muscles, and limbs to maintain posture and balance.

###Shape###
The vestibular system is made up of fluid-filled structures that detect movement and position changes:
Semicircular Canals: Three curved loops arranged at right angles to each other, sensing rotational movement of the head (turning, tilting, spinning).
Vestibule: A central chamber that contains two main sacs:
Utricle: Detects horizontal motion (forward, backward, side to side).
Saccule: Detects vertical motion (up and down).
Hair Cells (Mechanoreceptors): Specialized sensory cells inside the canals and vestibule that respond to movement of the inner ear fluid.
Vestibular Nerve: Carries balance signals from the inner ear to the brain.

##Function##
Detects head position and movement in all directions.
Sends rapid information to the brain to coordinate eye, neck, and body movements.
Maintains posture and equilibrium when standing, walking, or turning.
Helps the body stay balanced when the head moves suddenly or when the environment shifts.
Works closely with the visual and proprioceptive systems to ensure smooth and coordinated movement.
A healthy vestibular system allows dogs to run, jump, and change direction without losing balance.
When it is disturbed, dogs may show signs like head tilting, circling, or loss of coordination.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakras: Root and Solar Plexus Chakras – grounding, confidence, and coordination.
Meridian Connections: Kidney and Bladder Meridians – balance, adaptation, and flow.
Emotional Meaning: Represents the ability to stay centered and stable even when life moves quickly or unexpectedly.
Imbalance may express as disorientation, confusion, or anxiety.
Balanced Energy: Calm focus, grounded awareness, and fluid movement.
Energetic Support:
Gentle movement and massage along the spine and neck.
Quiet surroundings during recovery or rest.
Frequency or sound therapy can help restore energetic equilibrium.

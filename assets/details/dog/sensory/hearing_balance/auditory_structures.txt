#Auditory Structures#

The dog’s auditory system is finely tuned to detect a wide range of sounds and frequencies.  
It helps with communication, alertness, and emotional awareness.  
Energetically, it represents **listening, intuition, and sensitivity to vibration and truth**.

###Parts###

##Outer Ear (Pinna)##  
Funnels sound into the ear canal.  
Energetically, symbolizes **awareness and receptivity**.

##Ear Canal##  
Carries sound waves toward the eardrum.  
Energetically, reflects **focus and openness** to receive communication.

##Eardrum (Tympanic Membrane)##  
Vibrates in response to sound.  
Energetically, embodies **resonance and emotional responsiveness**.

##Middle Ear Bones (Ossicles)##  
Transmit and amplify vibrations.  
Energetically, represent **clarity and understanding**.

##Inner Ear (Cochlea)##  
Transforms vibration into electrical signals for hearing.  
Energetically, symbolizes **translation of outer experience into inner knowing**.

###Function###  
The auditory system allows the dog to detect subtle sounds, locate direction, and respond to communication and emotion.  
Energetically, it supports **connection, awareness, and harmony through attentive listening**.

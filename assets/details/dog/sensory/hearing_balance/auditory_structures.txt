#Auditory System#

##Location##
The auditory system is located in the head, extending from the outer ear through the middle ear into the inner ear, which is embedded deep within the temporal bone of the skull.
It connects to the brainstem via the auditory nerve and also supports balance and coordination through specialized inner ear structures.

###Shape###
The outer ear consists of the pinna (visible ear flap) and ear canal, which funnel sound waves inward.
The middle ear is an air-filled space containing three small bones: the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and stapes (stirrup) — collectively called the ossicles.
The inner ear contains the cochlea (hearing organ) and vestibular apparatus (balance organs), including the semicircular canals and vestibule (utricle and saccule).

##Function##
The pinna captures sound waves and directs them through the ear canal to the tympanic membrane (eardrum).
The eardrum vibrates in response to sound waves, moving the ossicles in sequence: malleus → incus → stapes.
The stapes transfers vibrations into the cochlea, where tiny hair cells convert mechanical energy into electrical signals.
The auditory nerve carries these signals to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.
The vestibular system (inner ear) detects head movement and position using fluid motion within the semicircular canals and vestibule.
This balance information travels to the brain to coordinate posture, movement, and spatial orientation.
Dogs can hear frequencies from approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz, far beyond the human range.
Their mobile, funnel-shaped ears can rotate independently to locate sound sources with precision.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakras: Throat and Solar Plexus Chakras – communication, awareness, and focus.
Meridian Connections: Kidney and Bladder Meridians – balance, stability, and adaptability.
Emotional Meaning: Hearing represents the ability to listen, receive, and respond — not just to sound, but also to guidance and emotion.
Imbalance may appear as hypersensitivity, anxiety, or avoidance of certain tones.
Balanced Energy: Calm alertness, emotional presence, and steady perception.
Energetic Support: Gentle tone of voice, rhythmic sound therapy, and peaceful surroundings enhance sensory and emotional balance.

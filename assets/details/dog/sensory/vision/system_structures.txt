#System Structures#

The dog’s visual system structures are responsible for detecting light, processing visual information, and transmitting signals to the brain.
They enable sight, motion detection, depth perception, and environmental awareness.
Energetically, they represent perception, insight, interpretation, and how the dog understands and navigates the world.

###Parts###

##Retina##
The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye containing photoreceptors.
Converts light into neural signals.
Energetically, represents perception, awareness, and how reality is received.

##Rods##
Photoreceptor cells specialized for low-light and motion detection.
Highly developed in dogs for night vision.
Energetically, symbolize sensitivity, intuition, and awareness in darkness or uncertainty.

##Cones##
Photoreceptor cells responsible for color vision and detail.
Dogs primarily perceive blue and yellow hues.
Energetically, represent discernment, clarity, and focused perception.

##Optic Disc##
The point where the optic nerve exits the retina.
No photoreceptors are present.
Energetically, symbolizes transition and integration of perception.

##Optic Nerve##
Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
Energetically, represents communication, trust, and information flow.

##Optic Chiasm##
The crossing point of optic nerve fibers.
Allows coordination between both eyes.
Energetically, reflects balance, integration, and coordination.

##Optic Tract##
Carries visual signals from the optic chiasm to the brain.
Energetically, symbolizes direction and continuity of perception.

##Lateral Geniculate Nucleus##
Processes visual signals within the thalamus before reaching the cortex.
Energetically, represents filtering, prioritization, and interpretation.

##Visual Cortex##
Located in the occipital lobe of the brain.
Interprets visual information into meaningful images.
Energetically, symbolizes understanding, meaning-making, and conscious awareness.

###Function###
Receive light, convert it into neural signals, transmit visual information, and interpret the environment accurately.
Energetically, these structures support insight, awareness, orientation, and confident interaction with surroundings.

###Common Imbalances###
Vision loss, reduced night vision, neurological vision issues, or processing difficulties.
Energetically, imbalance may reflect confusion, fear of perception, disorientation, or difficulty interpreting experiences.

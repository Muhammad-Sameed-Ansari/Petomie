#Visual System#

##Location##
The eyes are located toward the front of the dog’s head, providing a good balance between binocular vision (depth perception) and peripheral vision.
Positioning varies by breed — dogs with flatter faces (like pugs) see more forward, while long-nosed breeds have wider side vision.
Each eye connects to the visual cortex of the brain via the optic nerve.

###Shape###
Rounded eyes with a dark central pupil surrounded by the iris.
The outer layers (cornea and sclera) protect the eye, while inner structures (lens, retina, and choroid) focus and interpret light.
The tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer at the back of the eye, gives dogs their characteristic eye shine in low light.

##Function##
The cornea and lens bend light to focus it on the retina.
The iris regulates light intake by adjusting the pupil size.
The retina contains rods (for brightness and motion) and cones (for color).
Dogs see primarily blue and yellow but not red and green.
The tapetum lucidum improves vision in dim light.
The optic nerve transmits visual signals to the brain.
Ciliary muscles adjust the lens to focus on close or distant objects.
Dogs’ vision is adapted for detecting movement, even in low light, which is vital for tracking and hunting.

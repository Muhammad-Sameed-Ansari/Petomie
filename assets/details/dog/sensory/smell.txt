It enables communication, hunting, and emotional awareness.  
Energetically, it represents **intuition, loyalty, and deep sensory wisdom** — guiding the dog’s connection with its surroundings and companions.

###Parts###

##Nostrils##  
Large and mobile, designed to draw air efficiently into the nasal passages.

##Nasal Cavity##  
Filters, warms, and channels air toward the olfactory region.  
Energetically, it reflects **clarity, order, and flow** of perception.

##Olfactory Epithelium##

Energetically, it embodies **loyalty, instinct, and discernment** — the ability to “read” energy through scent.

##Vomeronasal Organ (Jacobson’s Organ)##  
Located on the roof of the mouth, detects pheromones and emotional signals.  
Energetically, it bridges **instinct with emotional intelligence**, connecting to social and pack awareness.

##Olfactory Bulb##  
Processes scent data and links it to memory and emotion.  
Energetically, it represents **trust, empathy, and intuitive knowing**.

###Function###

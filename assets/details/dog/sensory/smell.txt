#Olfactory (Smell) System#

##Location##
The olfactory system is located within the **nasal cavity**, extending to the **olfactory bulb** at the front of the brain. 
Dogs have one of the most advanced olfactory systems in the animal kingdom, with millions of scent receptors lining the nasal passages.

###Shape###
- **Nostrils (Nares):** Two openings that draw air into separate nasal passages for breathing and smelling.  
- **Nasal Cavity:** Contains complex folded structures called **turbinates**, covered with olfactory epithelium.  
- **Olfactory Bulb:** Large brain structure dedicated to scent processing.  
- **Vomeronasal Organ:** Located between the roof of the mouth and nasal septum, detecting pheromones and social scents.  

##Function##
- Dogs can detect odors up to **100,000 times more sensitively than humans**.  
- When air enters, scent molecules bind to olfactory receptors, creating electrical signals sent to the brain.  
- The **olfactory bulb** interprets the chemical data into distinct smells.  
- The **vomeronasal organ** helps identify emotional states, hormones, and pheromones from other animals.  
- Smell is used for tracking, communication, and emotional awareness.  

###Energetic Connection###
- **Chakras:** Root and Sacral Chakras – grounding, emotional safety, and instinct.  
- **Meridian Connections:** Lung and Large Intestine Meridians – breathing, cleansing, and flow.  
- **Emotional Meaning:** Symbolizes intuitive understanding and environmental connection. Imbalance may appear as anxiety, disconnection, or overstimulation.  
- **Balanced Energy:** Calm curiosity, trust, and focus.  
- **Energetic Support:** Nature walks, fresh air, and rhythmic breathing help balance olfactory and emotional energy.

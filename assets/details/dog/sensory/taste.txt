#Gustatory (Taste) System#

##Location##
The gustatory system is centered on the **tongue**, **soft palate**, and **throat**. 
Taste buds are mainly located on the surface of the tongue, especially along the sides and back. 
Signals travel through the **facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves** to the brain’s taste centers.

###Shape###
The **tongue** is a muscular organ covered with **papillae**, some containing taste buds that detect chemical changes in food.  
The surface has a rough texture due to these small projections, helping in both tasting and manipulating food.

##Function##
- Dogs can taste **sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami**, with fewer taste buds than humans but more than cats.  
- Taste receptors detect chemical molecules dissolved in saliva.  
- These signals inform the brain about food quality, flavor, and safety.  
- Taste works together with **smell** to guide feeding behavior and preferences.  

Dogs use taste and smell together to explore their environment and food.

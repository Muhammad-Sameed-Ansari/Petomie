#Proprioceptive Hearing#

The dog’s proprioceptive hearing combines the sense of body awareness with sound perception.  
It allows the dog to orient and balance through feedback between hearing, muscles, and spatial awareness.  
Energetically, it represents **integration, awareness, and embodiment of sound**.

###Parts###

##Inner Ear and Vestibular System##  
Provide information about position and motion.  
Energetically, symbolize **alignment and grounding through vibration**.

##Muscle and Joint Receptors##  
Sense movement and posture in response to sound and vibration.  
Energetically, reflect **coordination and harmony** between body and perception.

##Auditory Pathways##  
Link sound detection to balance and response.  
Energetically, represent **synchronicity between awareness and motion**.

###Function###  
Integrates sound, movement, and balance.  
Helps dogs locate sound sources accurately and maintain equilibrium during motion.  
Energetically, it aligns **hearing with embodiment**, creating a seamless awareness of rhythm and space.

###Common Imbalances###  
Disorientation, imbalance, or hypersensitivity to sound.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **confusion, anxiety, or difficulty integrating experience**.

#Proprioceptive Touch#

The dog’s proprioceptive touch system allows it to sense the position, movement, and tension of its own body.  
This internal touch perception supports coordination, balance, and confident movement.  
Energetically, it represents **self-awareness, grounding, and physical confidence**.

###Parts###

##Muscle Spindles##  
Detect muscle stretch and movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **flexibility, responsiveness, and awareness of motion**.

##Tendon Organs##  
Sense tension and force in tendons.  
Energetically, represent **strength, limits, and controlled power**.

##Joint Receptors##  
Detect joint position and movement.  
Energetically, symbolize **direction, alignment, and purposeful action**.

##Fascia##  
Connects muscles, bones, and organs, transmitting tension and motion.  
Energetically, represents **flow, integration, and energetic communication**.

##Proprioceptive Nerves##  
Carry movement and position signals to the brain.  
Energetically, reflect **inner awareness and body communication**.

###Function###  
Proprioceptive touch allows the dog to run, jump, balance, and coordinate movement.  
It supports agility, posture, and physical confidence.  
Energetically, it creates **stability, embodiment, and trust in the body**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overactivation: tension, restlessness, rigidity.  
Underactivation: clumsiness, insecurity, poor coordination.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **trauma, shock, or loss of bodily trust**.

#Cutaneous Hearing#

The dog’s cutaneous hearing refers to the ability to sense vibration and pressure changes through the skin and fur.  
It allows awareness of sound frequencies, movement, and energy before they are consciously heard.  
Energetically, it represents **sensitivity, intuition, and the blending of touch with sound**.

###Parts###

##Skin Receptors##  
Detect vibrations and pressure waves traveling through air and ground.  
Energetically, symbolize **awareness of subtle energetic communication**.

##Hair Follicles##  
Act as antennae for sensing micro-movements.  
Energetically, represent **perception beyond hearing**.

##Nerve Endings##  
Transmit vibrational information to the brain.  
Energetically, embody **connection between body and environmental rhythm**.

###Function###  
Enhances hearing by detecting low-frequency vibrations and changes in air pressure.  
Helps dogs sense footsteps, thunder, or emotional tone before sound fully reaches the ears.  
Energetically, it deepens **intuitive listening and environmental harmony**.

###Common Imbalances###  
Overstimulation or restlessness.  
Dulled response due to tension or trauma.  
Energetically, imbalance may reflect **emotional overload or disconnection from surroundings**.

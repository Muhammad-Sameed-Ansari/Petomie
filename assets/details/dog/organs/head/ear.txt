#Head – Ear#

##Location##
The ears are located on the top and sides of the head and can rotate to capture sounds from all directions.
Ear shapes vary — upright, folded, or floppy — but all serve to enhance hearing and expression.

###Shape###
Outer Ear (Pinna): collects sound waves and directs them into the ear canal.
Middle Ear: contains three small bones (malleus, incus, stapes) that transfer sound vibrations.
Inner Ear: includes the cochlea for hearing and the vestibular system for balance and coordination.

##Function##
Detects and interprets sound vibrations from near and far.
Locates direction and distance of sounds.
The inner ear maintains balance and spatial awareness.
Ears also express emotion and energy, showing alertness, relaxation, or stress.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) — linked with listening, communication, and truth.
Meridian Connection: Kidney Meridian (deep intuitive listening) and Small Intestine Meridian (clarity and discernment).
Emotional Meaning: The ears represent how one listens and receives from the environment and others.
Imbalance may cause sensitivity, avoidance, or difficulty processing sound or emotion.
Balanced Energy: Peaceful attention, emotional harmony, calm alertness.
Energetic Support: Sound healing, calm voice tones, and quiet surroundings restore energetic balance and relaxation.

#Head – Brain#

##Location##
The brain lies inside the skull, protected by the cranial bones and surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid.
It connects to the spinal cord through the brainstem, forming the control center for the nervous system.

###Shape###
A soft, folded organ made up of:
Cerebrum: controls thinking, movement, and learning.
Cerebellum: manages balance and coordination.
Brainstem: controls heartbeat, breathing, and reflexes.
The brain is divided into left and right hemispheres, connected by nerve fibers for communication between sides.

##Function##
Processes information from all five senses.
Controls movement, balance, and emotional reactions.
Regulates vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and temperature.
Stores memory, learning, and behavior patterns.
Integrates physical actions with emotional and instinctive responses.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) and Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) — intuition, higher awareness, and connection.
Meridian Connection: Governing Vessel (Du Mai) — unites Yang energy and supports mental strength.
Emotional Meaning: The brain represents consciousness, understanding, and inner balance.
Imbalance may cause confusion, overthinking, or emotional reactivity.
Balanced Energy: Clear focus, trust, emotional stability, and calm connection to life.
Energetic Support: Gentle cranial touch, energy balancing over the forehead and crown, and rest in quiet spaces harmonize the brain’s energetic flow.

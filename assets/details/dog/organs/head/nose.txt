#Head – Nose#

##Location##
The nose sits at the front of the muzzle, forming the entryway to the respiratory and olfactory systems.
It consists of the nostrils (nares), nasal cavities, and olfactory receptors that detect scent molecules.
Dogs have around 220 million scent receptors, giving them one of the most powerful senses of smell in the animal kingdom.

###Shape###
Two nostrils lead into long nasal passages lined with mucous membranes and fine hairs.
The olfactory epithelium inside detects odor molecules and sends signals to the olfactory bulb in the brain.
The wet nose surface helps trap scent particles and enhances smell.

##Function##
Detects and distinguishes scents for tracking, recognition, and emotional awareness.
Filters, warms, and humidifies air before it enters the lungs.
Plays a key role in social communication — dogs read emotional and chemical cues from people and animals.
Works with the vomeronasal organ (Jacobson’s organ) to sense pheromones and emotional states.

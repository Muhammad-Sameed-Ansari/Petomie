#Head – Eye#

##Location##
The eyes are positioned on the front sides of the head, giving a broad field of view and excellent motion detection.
They sit within bony sockets (orbits), protected by eyelids, lashes, and a third eyelid (nictitating membrane) that keeps the eyes moist and clean.

###Shape###
Rounded organs made up of the cornea, iris, lens, and retina.
The retina contains light-sensitive cells — rods for dim light and cones for daylight and color.
Nerve signals travel from the retina through the optic nerve to the brain, creating vision.

##Function##
Detects light, color, shape, and movement.
Allows clear vision and helps navigate safely in various light conditions.
The third eyelid protects the eye from dust and dryness.
Eyes also reflect emotion and communication, showing calmness, trust, or alertness.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) — intuition, perception, and inner awareness.
Meridian Connection: Liver Meridian (controls eye health) and Gallbladder Meridian (affects side vision and clarity).
Emotional Meaning: The eyes represent how one perceives life — physically and emotionally.
Imbalance may relate to fear of seeing clearly, confusion, or emotional overwhelm.
Balanced Energy: Clear inner vision, calm perception, intuitive trust.
Energetic Support: Gentle eye massage, grounding time outdoors, and natural light help restore energetic clarity and focus.

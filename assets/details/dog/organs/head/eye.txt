#Eye Structures#

##Location##
Located within the orbit, protected by the eyelids, extraocular muscles, and surrounding bony socket. The eye is a spherical organ specialized for vision.

##Parts##
Cornea is the transparent, curved front surface of the eye that refracts (bends) incoming light.
Sclera is the opaque, white outer layer of the eyeball that provides structure and protection.
Iris is the colored portion of the eye that controls pupil size and regulates the amount of light entering.
Lens is a transparent, flexible structure behind the iris that focuses light onto the retina.
Retina is the innermost layer of the eye containing photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into neural signals.

##Function##
Together, these structures protect the eye, regulate light entry, focus light, and transform visual input into electrical signals for the brain, enabling vision in dogs.

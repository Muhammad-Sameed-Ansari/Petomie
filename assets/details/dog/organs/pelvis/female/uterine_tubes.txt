The uterine tubes extend from the ovaries to the uterine horns, lying within the dorsal abdomen.
Each tube is suspended by a thin fold of tissue called the mesosalpinx.

Two delicate, coiled tubes with a narrow passage.
The ends near the ovaries have fringed edges (fimbriae) that help guide the egg.

#Lungs#

##Location##
The lungs are located within the thoracic cavity, protected by the ribcage and surrounding the heart.
They extend from the shoulder region down to the diaphragm, filling most of the chest space.

###Shape###
Soft, spongy organs divided into lobes:
Left lung: smaller, with two lobes.
Right lung: larger, with four lobes.
Each lung is covered by a thin, slippery membrane called the pleura, which allows smooth movement during breathing.

##Function##
Draws in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.
Maintains acid–base balance and body temperature.
Filters out dust and particles through the mucous lining.
Works in harmony with the heart and diaphragm to support vitality and calmness.
###Energetic Connection###

#Heart#

##Location##  
The dog’s heart lies within the **thoracic cavity** in the **middle mediastinum**, between the lungs, **slightly left of the midline**.  
It sits behind the sternum, commonly spanning about the **3rd to 6th intercostal spaces**, enclosed by the **pericardium** and attached to the diaphragm and great vessels.

###Shape###  
A strong, **cone-shaped muscular pump** with a broad base (dorsal) and a pointed apex (ventral).  
Designed for efficient circulation at rest and rapid increases during exercise or excitement.

###Parts###  

##Pericardium##  
A protective sac surrounding the heart (fibrous + serous layers) with a thin fluid layer to reduce friction.  
Energetically, represents **protection, boundaries, and emotional safety**.

##Right Atrium##  
Receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the **cranial and caudal vena cava**.  
Includes the **auricle** (ear-like pouch) that helps with filling.  
Energetically, reflects **receiving support and being held**.

##Right Ventricle##  
Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs through the **pulmonary trunk/arteries**.  
Energetically, symbolizes **release and clearing**.

##Left Atrium##  
Receives oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the **pulmonary veins**.  
Also has an **auricle**.  
Energetically, represents **acceptance, openness, and renewal**.

##Left Ventricle##  
The thickest muscular chamber; pumps oxygenated blood to the body through the **aorta**.  
Energetically, symbolizes **purpose, strength, and forward drive**.

##Interatrial Septum##  
Wall separating the right and left atria.  
Energetically, reflects **discernment and healthy separation**.

##Interventricular Septum##  
Wall separating the ventricles; important for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction.  
Energetically, symbolizes **inner alignment and integrity**.

##Tricuspid Valve (Right AV Valve)##  
Between right atrium and right ventricle; prevents backflow during contraction.  
Supported by **chordae tendineae** and **papillary muscles**.  
Energetically, reflects **trust and steady rhythm in giving/receiving**.

##Mitral Valve (Bicuspid, Left AV Valve)##  
Between left atrium and left ventricle; prevents backflow.  
Also supported by **chordae tendineae** and **papillary muscles**.  
Energetically, symbolizes **heart-coherence and loyalty**.

##Pulmonary Valve##  
At the exit of the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery; ensures one-way flow to the lungs.  
Energetically, represents **cleansing and letting go**.

##Aortic Valve##  
At the exit of the left ventricle into the aorta; ensures one-way flow to the body.  
Energetically, reflects **steady leadership and life force distribution**.

##Chordae Tendineae##  
Strong “heart strings” attaching AV valves to papillary muscles to prevent valve prolapse.  
Energetically, symbolize **connection, support, and stability**.

##Papillary Muscles##  
Muscular anchors inside ventricles that tense the chordae during contraction.  
Energetically, represent **inner support and reliability under pressure**.

##Great Vessels##  
**Cranial & Caudal Vena Cava:** bring blood back from the body to the right atrium.  
**Pulmonary Artery:** sends blood from right ventricle to lungs.  
**Pulmonary Veins:** return oxygenated blood to left atrium.  
**Aorta:** sends oxygenated blood from left ventricle to the body.  
Energetically, reflect **flow, exchange, and life movement**.

##Coronary Arteries & Cardiac Veins##  
Supply the heart muscle itself with oxygen and nutrients.  
Energetically, symbolize **self-nourishment and self-care**.

##Myocardium##  
The thick muscular layer responsible for pumping.  
Energetically, represents **courage, vitality, and emotional strength**.

##Endocardium##  
Smooth inner lining of chambers and valves, supporting efficient blood flow.  
Energetically, reflects **clarity, purity, and smooth communication**.

##Cardiac Conduction System##  
**SA node (pacemaker), AV node, Bundle of His, Purkinje fibers** coordinate heartbeat timing and rhythm.  
Energetically, symbolizes **timing, harmony, and internal guidance**.

###Function###  
Pumps blood through:  
- **Pulmonary circulation:** heart → lungs → heart (oxygen exchange)  
- **Systemic circulation:** heart → body → heart (nutrients/oxygen delivery)  

Supports oxygen delivery, waste removal, temperature regulation, and overall stamina.  
Energetically, governs **love, bonding, bravery, and emotional flow**.

###Energetic Connection###  
**Chakra:** Heart Chakra.  
**Meridian:** Heart and Pericardium Meridians.  
**Emotional Meaning:** Love, trust, connection, courage.  
**Balanced Energy:** Warmth, steadiness, resilience, open-hearted strength.

###Common Imbalances###  
Murmurs/valve disease, rhythm irregularities, fatigue/exercise intolerance, tension patterns.  
Energetically, **grief, guardedness, over-responsibility, or emotional shock**.

###Energetic Healing Suggestions###  
Provide calm environment, routine, and appropriate exercise for the dog’s condition.  
**Colors:** Green and pink restore harmony.  
**Crystals:** Rose quartz, aventurine support heart balance.  
**Elements:** Air (breath/space) + Fire (warmth/vitality) to support rhythm.  
**Affirmation:** “My heart is steady, safe, and strong in loving connection.”

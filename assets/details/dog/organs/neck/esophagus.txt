#Esophagus#

##Location##
The esophagus is a muscular tube located behind the trachea, running from the pharynx to the stomach.
It passes through the chest cavity and the diaphragm before connecting to the stomach.

###Shape###
A long, flexible tube made of circular muscles lined with mucous membrane.
These muscles contract in a wave-like motion called peristalsis, pushing food and liquid toward the stomach.

##Function##
Transports food and water from the mouth to the stomach.
Prevents backflow through a sphincter at the stomach entrance.
Works automatically through involuntary muscle contractions.
Plays a key role in the first stage of digestion.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) and Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) — linked to processing and expression.
Meridian Connection: Stomach Meridian (nourishment and digestion) and Spleen Meridian (absorption and stability).
Emotional Meaning: The esophagus represents how one receives and processes experiences.
Imbalance may appear as swallowing difficulties, stress, or resistance to accepting new situations.
Balanced Energy: Ease in receiving nourishment and emotional acceptance.
Energetic Support: Slow eating, relaxed feeding time, and gentle energy work along the neck and chest promote harmony and flow.

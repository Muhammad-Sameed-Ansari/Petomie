#Trachea#

##Location##
The trachea, or windpipe, extends from the larynx down the neck into the chest cavity, where it divides into the two main bronchi that lead to the lungs.

###Shape###
A flexible, tube-like structure made of C-shaped cartilage rings connected by muscle and connective tissue.
The cartilage keeps the airway open, while the soft back portion allows movement and expansion.

##Function##
Carries air to and from the lungs during breathing.
Filters and humidifies air with mucous and cilia lining the walls.
Expels dust or irritants through cough reflexes.
Allows freedom of neck motion without airway collapse.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) and Heart Chakra (Anahata).
Meridian Connection: Lung Meridian (respiration and vitality).
Emotional Meaning: Represents the flow of life energy (breath) and open communication.
Imbalance may show as coughing, restricted breathing, or emotional tightness in the chest or throat.
Balanced Energy: Steady, open breathing and emotional freedom.
Energetic Support: Deep, slow breathing, chest and neck relaxation, and calm surroundings enhance tracheal energy flow.

#Larynx#

##Location##
The larynx, or voice box, is located in the front of the neck, just behind the base of the tongue and above the trachea.
It connects the pharynx (throat) to the trachea (windpipe) and is part of both the respiratory and vocal systems.

###Shape###
A short, tube-shaped structure made of cartilage, muscles, and ligaments.
The most noticeable cartilage is the thyroid cartilage, which helps protect the vocal cords.
Inside, two folds of tissue — the vocal cords — can tighten or relax to produce sound.

##Function##
Controls airflow to and from the lungs.
Produces sound by vibrating the vocal cords when air passes through.
Protects the airway by closing during swallowing so food doesn’t enter the trachea.
Plays a key role in barking, growling, whining, and other vocal expressions.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) — linked with communication, self-expression, and truth.

Imbalance may appear as over-barking, loss of voice, or suppressed communication.

Energetic Support: Gentle neck massage, peaceful vocal tones, and calm breathing exercises help harmonize throat energy.

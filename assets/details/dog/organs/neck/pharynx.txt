#Pharynx#

##Location##
The pharynx, or throat cavity, lies behind the nasal cavity and mouth and connects to both the esophagus and larynx.
It serves as a shared pathway for both air (to the lungs) and food (to the stomach).

###Shape###
A muscular tube lined with mucous membrane that extends from the back of the nasal passages down to the larynx and esophagus.
It contains the soft palate and epiglottis, which help guide food and air in the correct direction.

##Function##
Directs air into the trachea and food into the esophagus.
Assists in swallowing through coordinated muscle contractions.
Supports breathing and vocalization.
Plays a role in smell and taste integration as both air and scent pass through this region.
###Energetic Connection###
Chakra: Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) and Heart Chakra (Anahata) — connection between expression and emotion.
Meridian Connection: Lung Meridian (breath) and Stomach Meridian (ingestion and nourishment).
Emotional Meaning: Represents the flow between taking in and expressing energy — physically and emotionally.
Imbalance may lead to choking sensations, tension, or difficulty “swallowing” emotions.
Balanced Energy: Smooth energy exchange between heart and throat, ease of breathing and swallowing.
Energetic Support: Calm feeding, relaxed breathing, and gentle throat energy work restore openness and comfort.

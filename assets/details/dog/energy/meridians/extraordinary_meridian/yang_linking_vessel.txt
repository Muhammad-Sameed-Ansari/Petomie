#Yang Linking Vessel (Yang Wei Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they form the energetic framework that supports agility, external awareness, and dynamic coordination.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining balance between inner calm and outward activity.  

The **Yang Linking Vessel** governs **adaptability, coordination, and the synchronization of external energy**.  
It represents rhythm, alertness, and the ability to respond fluidly to change while maintaining inner balance.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the outer hind limb, travels up the side of the body along the ribs, through the shoulder and neck, and ends near the outer side of the head and eye.  
This upward and lateral path links outer awareness with alert action and responsiveness.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates muscle coordination, temperature balance, and movement rhythm.  
It supports flexibility, agility, and communication between the limbs and spine.  
Energetically, it governs alertness, presence, and adaptability — helping the dog act from calm awareness rather than reactivity.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Stiffness in the shoulders, hips, or flanks, poor coordination, or uneven gait.  
Energetic disharmony such as overexcitement, impulsivity, or nervous tension.  
The dog may appear restless, agitated, or overly reactive to environmental stimuli.

#Girdling Vessel (Dai Mai)#

##Location##
Encircles the body horizontally at the level of the last rib and lumbar region.
Begins near the lateral ribcage close to the last rib (at the approximate site of GB-26) and wraps around the waist, linking the spine, flanks, and lower abdomen.
It interacts with the Liver, Gall Bladder, and Spleen meridians, forming an energetic “belt” that balances front and back, upper and lower body regions.

##Shape##
A horizontal meridian — the only one that travels around the dog’s body like a band.
It stabilizes the torso, supports spinal alignment, and prevents Qi from sinking or stagnating in the lower abdomen.
This meridian reflects a dog’s ability to move fluidly and stay grounded during quick turns and directional changes.

##Function##
Binds vertical meridians and maintains body alignment
Supports core strength and spinal balance
Regulates reproductive and digestive organs
Prevents energy stagnation in the lower trunk
Promotes emotional centering and stability

##Signs of Imbalance##
Tension or stiffness around the midsection or lower back
Digestive issues such as gas or sluggish appetite
Hormonal or urinary irregularities
Weak core muscles or loss of coordination during movement
Anxiety, poor grounding, or hyper-reactivity

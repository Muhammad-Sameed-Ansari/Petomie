#Girdling Vessel (Dai Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they create the energetic foundation for posture, movement, and coordination between upper and lower body.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining internal balance and supporting the dog’s adaptability and vitality.  

The **Girdling Vessel** encircles the body like a belt and governs **balance, stability, and integration**.  
It represents the ability to stay centered and composed, uniting all directions of movement into harmony.  
It embodies rhythm, coordination, and the confidence to act from a grounded state.

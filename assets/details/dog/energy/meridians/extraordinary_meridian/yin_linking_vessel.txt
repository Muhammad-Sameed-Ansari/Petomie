#Yin Linking Vessel (Yin Wei Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they form the energetic foundation for emotional depth, inner harmony, and overall coherence of body and spirit.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining inner stability and supporting emotional intelligence and adaptability.  

The **Yin Linking Vessel** governs **emotional integration, inner harmony, and the regulation of internal energy**.  
It represents the connection between emotion, memory, and vitality — helping the dog process life’s experiences with balance and calm understanding.

#Conception Vessel (Ren Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they form the energetic foundation that links body, mind, and spirit, influencing breathing, digestion, reproduction, and emotional stability.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining internal balance and supporting the dog’s adaptability and vitality.  

The **Conception Vessel** represents the **Yin aspect** of the body and runs along the midline of the underside.  
It connects and nourishes all Yin meridians, supporting internal strength, restoration, and emotional harmony.  
It embodies nurturing, receptivity, and the essence of self-care and trust.

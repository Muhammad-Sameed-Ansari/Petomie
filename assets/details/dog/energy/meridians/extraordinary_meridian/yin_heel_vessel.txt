#Yin Heel Vessel (Yin Qiao Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they form the energetic foundation for balance, stability, and emotional composure.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining internal equilibrium and supporting adaptability and awareness.  

The **Yin Qiao Mai**, also called the **Yin Heel Vessel**, governs **posture, stillness, and internal balance**.  
It represents calm focus, restfulness, and the ability to remain grounded and composed in both body and spirit.  

###Shape and Pathway###

This ascending pathway connects grounding energy from the earth to perception and awareness.  

###Function###

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness or stiffness in the inner hind limbs, imbalance when standing, or difficulty remaining still.

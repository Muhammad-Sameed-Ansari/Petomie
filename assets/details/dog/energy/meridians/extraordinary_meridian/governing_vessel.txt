#Governing Vessel (Du Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they form the energetic foundation that links body, mind, and spirit, influencing posture, instinct, and emotional stability.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining internal balance and supporting the dog’s adaptability and vitality.  

The **Governing Vessel** represents the **Yang aspect** of the body and runs along the midline of the back.  
It connects and nourishes all Yang meridians, governing energy flow, strength, and outward expression.  
It embodies confidence, alertness, and the natural authority of balanced action.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the base of the tail, travels upward along the spine, over the neck and head, and ends at the upper lip and nose.  
This ascending pathway reflects vitality and the steady rise of energy through the body’s core.  

###Function###

It maintains posture, balance, and muscular tone.

Stiffness or pain along the spine, weakness in the hindquarters, or neurological tension.  
Energetic disharmony such as insecurity, hypersensitivity, or loss of confidence.

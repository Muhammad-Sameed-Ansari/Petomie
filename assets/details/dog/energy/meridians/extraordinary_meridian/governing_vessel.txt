#Governing Vessel (Du Mai)#

##Location##
Begins at the perineum, midway between the anus and the base of the tail (GV-1).
From there, it ascends along the midline of the tail and continues over the sacrum and up the spinal column, running between the long back muscles along the topline.
It passes over the withers, thoracic spine, and neck, then continues between the ears over the poll.
From the crown, it travels forward over the skull and down the nasal bridge, ending at the upper lip above the incisor teeth (GV-28).
Internally, it connects with the brain, spinal cord, and all Yang meridians of the body.

##Shape##
A single, midline meridian running from the base of the tail to the upper lip, mirroring the spine and nervous system.
It governs the entire dorsal aspect of the body and represents the core of Yang energy, strength, and movement.

##Function##

Supports the nervous system and brain communication

##Signs of Imbalance##

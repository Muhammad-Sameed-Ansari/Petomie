#Yang Heel Vessel (Yang Qiao Mai)#

The **Extraordinary Meridians** are deeper energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They act as reservoirs of **Qi and Blood**, regulating and balancing the flow within the Primary Meridians.  
In dogs, they form the energetic foundation for movement, alertness, and external engagement.  
Each Extraordinary Vessel harmonizes Yin and Yang forces, maintaining internal equilibrium and supporting adaptability and presence.  

The **Yang Heel Vessel** governs **movement, agility, and outward awareness**.  
It represents readiness to act, responsiveness, and the expression of Yang energy through motion and alertness.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer hind paw, travels up the outer side of the hind limb, passes over the hip and flank, ascends the back and neck, and ends near the outer corner of the eye.  
This rising and outward path supports dynamic motion and the ability to respond to the environment with confidence.  

###Function###  
Physically, it controls the muscles of the outer limbs, coordinates flexibility, and regulates balance during movement.  
It influences alertness, eye movement, and responsiveness.  
Energetically, it governs awareness, confidence, and the expression of Yang energy through action.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Tension in the outer limbs, stiffness in the back or hips, or imbalance during motion.  
Energetic disharmony such as over-alertness, nervousness, or restlessness.  
The dog may appear reactive, over-energized, or unable to settle.

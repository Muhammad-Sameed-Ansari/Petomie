#Stomach Meridian (Wei Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and vitality, and **energetic aspects** such as enthusiasm, appetite for life, and trust.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to live with balance, curiosity, and vitality.  

The **Stomach Meridian** governs **digestion, nourishment, and emotional stability**.  
It represents the process of taking in, transforming, and utilizing energy — both physically and emotionally.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins below the eye, travels down the face and neck, along the chest and abdomen, down the front of the hind limb, and ends at the top of the second toe on the hind paw.  
This downward pathway mirrors the digestive flow — from intake to release.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates appetite, digestion, and nutrient absorption.  
It influences the muscles, mouth, and lips and supports the entire digestive tract.  
Energetically, it governs satisfaction, contentment, and grounded presence.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Vomiting, bloating, poor appetite, or stiffness in the hind limbs.  
Energetic disharmony such as anxiety, overthinking, or dissatisfaction.  
The dog may display excessive worry or lose interest in food and activity.

#Small Intestine Meridian (Xiao Chang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, circulation, and nutrient absorption, and **energetic aspects** such as discernment, clarity, and trust.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to act with confidence, balance, and emotional stability.  

The **Small Intestine Meridian** governs **assimilation, clarity, and discernment**.  
It represents the ability to separate what is pure and useful from what is unnecessary — both physically and emotionally.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer tip of the front paw, travels up the back of the forelimb, crosses the shoulder, ascends along the neck and cheek, and ends near the ear.  
This upward and outward path supports digestion, perception, and communication.  

###Function###  
Physically, it aids digestion and absorption, ensuring nutrients are distributed efficiently.  
It supports the heart and helps refine both physical and emotional input.  
Energetically, it governs understanding, clarity, and emotional separation — knowing what to keep and what to release.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Digestive upset, shoulder stiffness, or ear irritation.  
Energetic disharmony such as confusion, frustration, or hypersensitivity.  
The dog may appear reactive, indecisive, or emotionally inconsistent.

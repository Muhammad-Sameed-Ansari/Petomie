#Bladder Meridian (Pang Guang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as elimination, circulation, and nervous system activity, and **energetic aspects** such as stability, trust, and emotional grounding.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to feel balanced, confident, and connected.  

The **Bladder Meridian** governs **fluid regulation, energy flow along the spine, and release**.  
It represents endurance, structure, and the ability to let go of accumulated tension or emotional weight.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inner corner of the eye, travels over the head and neck, runs along both sides of the spine, over the hips, down the hind limbs, and ends at the outer tip of the hind paw.  
This long descending pathway mirrors the flow of Qi along the back, supporting relaxation and grounding.  

###Function###  
Physically, it manages urination, hydration, and the nervous system.  
It influences the spinal column, muscles, and back flexibility.  
Energetically, it governs courage, emotional stability, and the ability to release fear and tension.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Back stiffness, urinary issues, or tension along the spine or hind limbs.  
Energetic disharmony such as fear, defensiveness, or inability to relax.  
The dog may appear restless, protective, or reactive to touch along the back.

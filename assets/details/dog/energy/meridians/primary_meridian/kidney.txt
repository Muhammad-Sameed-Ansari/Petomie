#Kidney Meridian (Shen Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as growth, reproduction, and bone health, and **energetic aspects** such as willpower, trust, and resilience.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to move with stability, courage, and grounded energy.  

The **Kidney Meridian** governs **vital essence, reproduction, and longevity**.  
It represents the root of life energy — the deep reserves of vitality that sustain physical and emotional endurance.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the underside of the hind paw, travels up the inner side of the hind limb, through the abdomen and chest, and ends near the inner side of the shoulder.  
This ascending pathway links the foundation of physical strength with the core of life energy.  

###Function###  
Physically, it supports bone development, reproductive function, and kidney filtration.  
It influences the adrenal glands, hearing, and energy restoration.  
Energetically, it governs courage, trust, and endurance — the power to face life’s challenges calmly and steadily.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak hind limbs, urinary or reproductive problems, fatigue, or fearfulness.  
Energetic disharmony such as insecurity, lack of willpower, or fear of change.  
The dog may appear timid, exhausted, or overly dependent.

#Pericardium Meridian (Xin Bao Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as circulation, emotional regulation, and muscular coordination, and **energetic aspects** such as affection, empathy, and inner peace.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to remain emotionally open, calm, and connected.  

The **Pericardium Meridian** governs **emotional protection, balance, and heart-centered connection**.  
It represents the ability to maintain openness while being emotionally safe and grounded in compassion.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the chest, travels down the inside of the forelimb, and ends at the middle of the front paw.  
This smooth downward path mirrors the flow of emotional energy from the heart to expression and interaction.  

###Function###  
Physically, it protects the heart from stress, regulates circulation, and balances temperature.  
It supports calm communication and emotional bonding.  
Energetically, it governs empathy, forgiveness, and emotional security — allowing the heart to feel without being overwhelmed.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Heart palpitations, tension in the chest or forelimb, excessive heat, or anxiety.  
Energetic disharmony such as hypersensitivity, emotional detachment, or overexcitement.  
The dog may appear restless, overly affectionate, or withdrawn from interaction.

#Spleen Meridian (Pi Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, immunity, and blood circulation, and **energetic aspects** such as empathy, focus, and emotional stability.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to remain grounded, loyal, and centered.  

The **Spleen Meridian** governs **transformation, nourishment, and grounding energy**.  
It represents the ability to absorb life’s experiences, convert them into strength, and maintain balance in thought and movement.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inside of the hind paw, travels up the inner hind limb, through the abdomen, along the ribs, and ends at the chest near the shoulder.  
This upward and nurturing pathway supports digestion and the movement of energy toward the heart and lungs.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates nutrient absorption, metabolism, and the creation of blood and energy.  
It influences the muscles and helps maintain balance and coordination.  
Energetically, it governs empathy, focus, and the ability to feel secure and supported.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Loss of appetite, loose stools, muscle weakness, or lethargy.  
Energetic disharmony such as worry, overthinking, or lack of confidence.  
The dog may appear tired, clingy, or unable to concentrate on tasks or training.

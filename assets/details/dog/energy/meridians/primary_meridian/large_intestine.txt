#Large Intestine Meridian (Da Chang Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, elimination, and respiration, and **energetic aspects** such as adaptability, communication, and confidence.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to act with loyalty, clarity, and natural rhythm.  

The **Large Intestine Meridian** governs **elimination, purification, and emotional release**.  
It represents the ability to let go of what no longer serves — both physically and energetically.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer edge of the front paw, travels up the front of the forelimb, across the shoulder, along the neck, and ends beside the nostril.  
This upward and outward pathway symbolizes the clearing and renewal of life energy.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates bowel movements, waste elimination, and moisture balance.  
It influences the nose and sinuses and helps maintain healthy skin.  
Energetically, it aids in processing emotions, supporting adaptability and decisiveness.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Constipation, diarrhea, nasal congestion, or stiffness in the shoulders or forelimbs.  
Energetic disharmony such as irritability, resistance to change, or difficulty letting go.  
The dog may seem restless, defensive, or overly attached to familiar patterns.

#Triple Heater Meridian (San Jiao Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as metabolism, temperature, and organ coordination, and **energetic aspects** such as adaptability, balance, and communication.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to live with vitality, awareness, and flexibility.  

The **Triple Heater Meridian** governs **energy regulation, temperature balance, and communication between body systems**.  
It represents the harmony of upper, middle, and lower body — integrating respiration, digestion, and elimination.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the outer tip of the front paw, travels up the back of the forelimb, over the shoulder and neck, and ends near the outer corner of the eye.  
This upward and outward pathway connects physical function with sensory awareness and alertness.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates warmth, metabolism, and the coordination between organs.  
It ensures smooth energy distribution throughout the body and balances fluid levels.  
Energetically, it governs adaptability, communication, and alignment of inner and outer awareness.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling, stiffness in the neck or shoulders, irregular body temperature, or fatigue.  
Energetic disharmony such as frustration, tension, or difficulty adapting to change.  
The dog may seem restless, uncoordinated, or emotionally inconsistent.

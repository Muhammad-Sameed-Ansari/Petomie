#Gallbladder Meridian (Dan Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as digestion, muscle coordination, and balance, and **energetic aspects** such as decision-making, confidence, and courage.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to act with clarity, grace, and assurance.  

The **Gallbladder Meridian** governs **decision-making, direction, and courage in action**.  
It represents clarity, initiative, and the ability to take aligned, confident movement.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins near the outer corner of the eye, curves around the ear, travels down the side of the neck and ribs, along the hip and outer hind limb, and ends at the outer edge of the hind paw.  
This lateral and flowing pathway expresses agility, coordination, and balance in motion.  

###Function###  
Physically, it supports digestion through bile secretion, muscle tone, and coordination.  
It works closely with the liver to distribute energy smoothly throughout the body.  
Energetically, it governs courage, decisiveness, and the ability to move forward without hesitation.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Muscle stiffness, joint discomfort, or imbalance in coordination.  
Energetic disharmony such as fear of movement, indecision, or frustration.  
The dog may appear tense, reactive, or hesitant to follow direction.

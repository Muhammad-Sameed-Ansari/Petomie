#Lung Meridian (Fei Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as breathing, circulation, and digestion, and **energetic aspects** such as intuition, awareness, and emotional communication.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to move with vitality, confidence, and loyalty.  

The **Lung Meridian** governs **respiration, vitality, and emotional openness**.  
It represents the breath of life, inspiration, and the connection between the outer world and inner self.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins in the chest near the lungs, travels outward to the shoulder, runs down the front of the forelimb, and ends at the inside edge of the front paw.  
This descending pathway reflects the movement of breath into form, grounding inspiration into steady presence.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates breathing, oxygen exchange, and immune defense.  
It influences skin health, hair coat quality, and the rhythm of respiration.  
Energetically, it governs release, emotional clarity, and the ability to express or let go of grief.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Coughing, shallow breathing, dry skin, or sensitivity around the chest or shoulders.  
Energetic disharmony such as sadness, withdrawal, or holding onto past emotional pain.  
The dog may appear tired, detached, or less enthusiastic in interaction.

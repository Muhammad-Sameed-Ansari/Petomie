#Lung Meridian (LU)#

##Location##
Begins deep within the chest, connecting internally with the lungs and throat before emerging at the lateral side of the cranial thorax near the first intercostal space (LU-1).
From there, it travels over the shoulder and runs distally along the medial side of the forelimb, following the groove between the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles.
It continues down the craniomedial surface of the forearm, crosses the medial carpus and metacarpus, and ends at the medial corner of the first digit on the front paw (LU-11).

A single, superficial meridian running from the chest down the inner forelimb to the front paw.
Closely follows the respiratory and circulatory pathways, representing the movement of breath and life force through the body.

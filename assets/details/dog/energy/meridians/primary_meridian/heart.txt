#Heart Meridian (Xin Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as circulation, respiration, and temperature balance, and **energetic aspects** such as love, joy, and emotional connection.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to live with vitality, openness, and heartfelt expression.  

The **Heart Meridian** governs **circulation, consciousness, and emotional presence**.  
It represents the flame of spirit — the expression of joy, affection, and connection with life.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins deep within the heart, emerges at the chest, travels through the shoulder, runs down the inside of the forelimb, and ends at the inner tip of the front paw.  
This gentle downward path reflects the connection between the heart and the outer world through touch and emotion.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates heartbeat, blood flow, and coordination between the heart and brain.  
It influences sleep, calmness, and mental clarity.  
Energetically, it governs joy, communication, and the ability to give and receive love freely.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Irregular heartbeat, anxiety, restlessness, or stiffness in the forelimb.  
Energetic disharmony such as nervousness, emotional withdrawal, or lack of joy.  
The dog may appear agitated, timid, or detached from connection.

#Liver Meridian (Gan Jing)#

The **Primary Meridians** are the twelve main energy channels described in **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)**.  
They form the core network through which **Qi (vital life force)** flows, connecting every organ, tissue, and emotion in the dog’s body.  
Each meridian is associated with a **Yin or Yang organ**, reflecting the dynamic balance between nourishment and activity, rest and motion, inner stillness and outward expression.  
In dogs, these meridians regulate both **physical functions** such as detoxification, blood flow, and muscular coordination, and **energetic aspects** such as patience, direction, and emotional flow.  
Together, they ensure harmony between body, mind, and spirit, allowing the dog to move with calm strength and purpose.  

The **Liver Meridian** governs **smooth flow of Qi, emotional balance, and physical flexibility**.  
It represents planning, purpose, and the ability to adapt gracefully to life’s challenges.  

###Shape and Pathway###  
Begins at the inside of the hind paw, travels up the inner hind limb, through the abdomen and chest, and ends near the eye.  
This upward and central pathway supports circulation, focus, and emotional equilibrium.  

###Function###  
Physically, it regulates blood storage, detoxification, and muscle function.  
It influences the eyes, tendons, and reproductive organs.  
Energetically, it governs patience, creativity, and vision — helping the dog move through life with clarity and calm intent.  

###Common Imbalances###  
Muscle stiffness, eye irritation, hormonal imbalance, or digestive issues.  
Energetic disharmony such as irritability, frustration, or suppressed emotion.  
The dog may appear tense, moody, or resistant to handling or guidance.

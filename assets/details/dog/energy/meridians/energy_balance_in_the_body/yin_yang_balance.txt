#Yin–Yang Balance#

##Location##
Exists throughout the entire dog’s body — within every organ, meridian, and energy field.
Yin and Yang represent the two complementary principles that sustain health and vitality:
###Yin###
Cooling, nourishing, receptive, and stabilizing energy.
###Yang###
Warming, active, protective, and expressive energy.
In dogs, Yin governs fluids, blood, rest, and internal harmony, while Yang governs movement, temperature, metabolism, and vitality.

##Shape##
Not a structure but a dynamic interplay flowing through all systems:
Organs: Kidney (Yin) with Bladder (Yang), Liver (Yin) with Gall Bladder (Yang), Heart (Yin) with Small Intestine (Yang), etc.
Meridians: Each Yin channel pairs with its Yang partner, balancing inner and outer surfaces.
Behavioral expression:
Yin energy appears as calmness, affection, patience, and sleep.
Yang energy shows as playfulness, enthusiasm, barking, and curiosity.
These two constantly shift — rest (Yin) transforms into action (Yang), and activity returns again to rest, creating rhythm and adaptability.

##Function##
Maintains the dog’s overall balance between rest and activity, body temperature, metabolism, and emotional stability.
Supports joint flexibility, coat health, digestion, and immune strength.
When Yin is deficient, signs may include restlessness, panting, overheating, dryness, or insomnia.
When Yang is deficient, symptoms can include fatigue, coldness, weakness, dull coat, or low motivation.
True harmony is achieved when Yin and Yang transform and balance each other continuously, keeping the dog grounded, vital, and emotionally centered.

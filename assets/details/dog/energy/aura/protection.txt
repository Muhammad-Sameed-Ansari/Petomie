#Aura Protection#

###Location###
Forms the outer energetic shield around all other layers of the dog’s aura.
Strongest around the heart, shoulders, and tail base—primary regions of emotional communication and boundary expression.

###Shape###
A responsive oval shell that adjusts to social situations.
It thickens when the dog senses danger, unfamiliar environments, or emotional tension, and softens when the dog feels safe and bonded.

###Meaning & Function###
This layer filters external energies and emotional signals before they reach deeper parts of the aura.

Functions include:
Protecting from stress or emotional overload
Supporting healthy boundaries
Preventing energetic drain
Maintaining confidence during new experiences

Dogs rely heavily on this layer during training, social interaction, and bonding.

###Signs of Weak Aura Protection###
Jumpiness or reactivity
Inability to handle new people or animals
Clinginess
Fear during separation
Environmental overwhelm

###Balancing Activities###
Secure routines
Positive social exposure
Soft handling and reassurance
Energetic sealing or grounding practices
A stable, calm home environment

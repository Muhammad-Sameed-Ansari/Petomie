#Aura Layers#

###Location###
Encircle the dog in concentric energetic layers, each radiating outward from the body and expressing a different aspect of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual function.

###Shape###
Oval and vibrant, shifting with motion, emotion, and attention.
Each layer holds a unique frequency:

Etheric Layer: Closest to the skin and coat, mirroring physical vitality, organs, and structure.
Emotional Layer: Holds emotional states, bonding patterns, and relational memory.
Mental Layer: Reflects training, thoughts, learned behaviors, and cognitive processing.
Spiritual Layer: The outermost layer, connecting the dog to intuition, purpose, and universal energy.

Balanced layers appear smooth and bright, working together as a unified energetic system.

###Function###

##Etheric Layer##
Shows physical condition and vitality,
Carries life force into muscles, tissues, and organs,
Early stress or illness appears as dullness or disruptions,
Weakness may appear as fatigue, stiffness, or lowered immunity.

##Emotional Layer##
Holds emotional bonds, memories, and reactions,
Shifts with connection, stress, or pack dynamics,
Bright and flowing during trust and affection,
Dense when holding fear, sadness, or insecurity.

##Mental Layer##
Carries thought patterns, training responses, and perception,
Supports understanding, clarity, and behavioral consistency,
Balanced when the dog shows focus, curiosity, and communication,
Distortion may cause confusion, overstimulation, or behavioral resistance.

##Spiritual Layer##
The most expansive, subtle, and luminous,
Connects the dog to intuition, guidance, and higher awareness,
Radiates peace, presence, and heart-centered energy,
Weakness may appear as disconnection, emotional dullness, or lack of purpose.

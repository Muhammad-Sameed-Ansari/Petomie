#Rib 14#

##Location##
Rib 14 is one of the floating ribs, typically ribs 14 and 15 in the dog.
These ribs do not attach to the sternum or to other ribs. Instead, they are anchored only to the thoracic vertebrae, allowing free movement at the rear of the ribcage.

###Shape###
Shorter and more slender than the other ribs, curving slightly toward the abdomen and ending freely without a ventral connection.

###Function###
Provide protection to the posterior organs, such as the kidneys, while allowing flexibility of the flank region.
Energetically, they represent freedom, release, and the ability to move with emotional and physical ease.

, Premolars (4): Sharp-edged teeth for slicing and crushing.  
, Molars (3): Flat-crowned teeth specialized for grinding and chewing.

##Function##

###Energetic Connection###
, Connected to the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians.  
, Represents grounding, nourishment, and emotional processing.  
, Imbalances may manifest as tension in the jaw, digestive stress, or difficulty “chewing over” experiences.

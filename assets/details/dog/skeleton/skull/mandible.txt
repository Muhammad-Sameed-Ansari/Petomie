#Mandible#

##Location##
Located in the lower part of the skull, forming the lower jaw of the dog.  
It is the largest and strongest bone of the skull and articulates with the temporal bones at the temporomandibular joints (TMJ).  
The mandible supports the lower teeth and enables chewing, biting, and vocalization.

###Parts###
1. **Body of the Mandible** – The horizontal portion forming the base of the jaw.  
   Houses the lower teeth within alveolar sockets.  
   Contains the mandibular canal for blood vessels and nerves.  
   Merges at the midline at the mandibular symphysis.

2. **Ramus of the Mandible** – The vertical section extending upward from the body.  
   Provides attachment for strong chewing muscles.  
   Articulates with the skull through the TMJ for jaw movement.

3. **Coronoid Process** – The dorsal projection of the ramus.  
   Serves as the attachment site for the temporal muscle, elevating the jaw.

4. **Condylar Process** – Rounded projection forming the articular surface of the TMJ.  
   Allows hinge and sliding motions during chewing and biting.

5. **Mandibular Notch** – Curved depression between the coronoid and condylar processes.  
   Provides space for vessels and nerves passing to the lower jaw.

6. **Mandibular Angle** – Junction between the body and ramus.  
   Serves as an attachment point for the masseter and digastric muscles.

7. **Mental Foramina** – Small openings on the lateral surface of the mandible.  
   Allow passage of nerves and vessels to the lips and chin.

##Function##
 Supports the lower teeth and enables chewing and biting.  
 Provides movement for mastication through the TMJ.  
 Protects nerves and blood vessels of the lower face.  
 Serves as attachment for facial and masticatory muscles.  
 Contributes to the structure and symmetry of the skull.

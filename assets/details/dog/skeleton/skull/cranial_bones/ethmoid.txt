#Ethmoid Bone#

##Location##
Located between the nasal cavity and the anterior cranial floor.  
Forms part of the nasal septum and contributes to the medial wall of the orbits.

###Parts###
1. **Cribriform Plate** – Perforated section separating the nasal cavity from the cranial cavity.  
   Allows passage of olfactory nerve fibers for smell perception.

2. **Perpendicular Plate** – Vertical bony structure forming part of the nasal septum.  
   Divides the nasal cavity into right and left halves.

3. **Ethmoidal Labyrinth** – Network of delicate ethmoidal air cells.  
   Forms part of the ethmoidal sinus and assists in air filtration.

##Function##
 Transmits olfactory nerves for the sense of smell.  
 Supports nasal and orbital structures.  
 Reduces skull weight through sinus cavities.  
 Contributes to airflow regulation and olfactory efficiency.

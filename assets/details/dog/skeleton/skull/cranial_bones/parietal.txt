#Parietal Bone#

##Location##
Located on the dorsolateral surface of the skull, forming the upper sides and roof of the cranial cavity.  
Meets its pair along the sagittal suture and articulates with frontal, temporal, and occipital bones.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – Flat, plate-like structure forming the cranial vault.  
   Protects the dorsal part of the brain.  
   Serves as a major structural element in the skull.

2. **Sagittal Crest** – Raised midline ridge formed where the two parietal bones meet.  
   Provides attachment for strong temporal muscles involved in mastication.

##Function##
 Protects the upper brain.  
 Provides muscle attachment for chewing and head stability.  
 Contributes to skull strength and cranial shape.

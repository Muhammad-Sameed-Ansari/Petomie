#Occipital Bone#

##Location##
Forms the back and base of the skull, enclosing the foramen magnum.  
Articulates with the first cervical vertebra (atlas) at the atlanto-occipital joint.

###Parts###
1. **Foramen Magnum** – Large central opening for passage of the spinal cord.  
   Connects the cranial cavity to the vertebral canal.

2. **Occipital Condyles** – Smooth, rounded projections on either side of the foramen magnum.  
   Articulate with the atlas, allowing nodding movement of the head.

3. **Nuchal Crest** – Ridge along the dorsal border of the occipital bone.  
   Provides attachment for neck and nuchal muscles.

4. **Basilar Part** – Extends forward beneath the brain.  
   Supports the brainstem and articulates with the sphenoid bone.

##Function##
 Protects the brainstem and forms the skull’s posterior boundary.  
 Provides articulation with the atlas.  
 Supports head movement and attachment for neck muscles.

   Contains the sphenoid sinus and supports the brain above.

2. **Greater Wings** – Extend laterally, forming part of the skull wall and containing openings for cranial nerves.  
   Provide structural reinforcement to the cranial base.

3. **Pterygoid Processes** – Extend ventrally from the body.  
   Serve as attachment points for pterygoid muscles used in jaw movement.

4. **Optic Canal** – Passage for the optic nerve to reach the eye.

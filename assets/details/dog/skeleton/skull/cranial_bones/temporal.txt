#Temporal Bone#

##Location##
Located on each side of the skull below the parietal bones and behind the zygomatic bones.  
Forms part of the skull base and the lateral walls of the cranium.

###Parts###
1. **Squamous Part** – Flat outer portion that forms part of the skull wall.  
   Articulates with the mandible to form the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

2. **Tympanic Part** – Surrounds the external acoustic meatus and houses the middle ear cavity.  
   Protects delicate hearing structures.

3. **Petrous Part** – Dense inner section enclosing the cochlea and semicircular canals.  
   Responsible for hearing and balance.

4. **Zygomatic Process** – Extends forward to meet the zygomatic bone.  
   Forms the zygomatic arch and serves as muscle attachment for mastication.

##Function##
 Protects and encloses auditory organs.  
 Supports jaw movement via the TMJ.  
 Provides attachment points for chewing and neck muscles.  
 Contributes to equilibrium and auditory function.

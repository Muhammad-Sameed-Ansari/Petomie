#Frontal Bone#

##Location##
Located at the front of the skull, forming the forehead and the upper part of the eye sockets.  
Borders the nasal bones rostrally and the parietal bones caudally, contributing to the cranial cavity roof.

###Parts###
1. **Body** – Broad plate forming the forehead and part of the orbit.  
   Protects the brain and eyes.  
   Shapes the skull’s anterior contour.

2. **Frontal Sinuses** – Air-filled cavities within the frontal bone.  
   Reduce skull weight and assist in vocal resonance.  
   Communicate with the nasal cavity through small openings.

3. **Orbital Margin** – Upper boundary of the eye socket.  
   Protects the eye and supports soft tissue around the orbit.

##Function##
 Protects the brain and eyes.  
 Forms part of the skull roof and orbital cavity.  
 Houses the frontal sinus and provides attachment for facial muscles.

#Hyoid Apparatus#

##Location##
Located in the throat region, suspended between the mandible and the larynx.  
The hyoid apparatus supports the tongue, pharynx, and larynx, allowing coordinated movements for swallowing, vocalization, and breathing.  
It consists of several small bones connected by cartilage and joints.

###Parts###
1. **Basihyoid Bone** – The central, unpaired bone of the apparatus.  
   Positioned transversely between the mandibular rami.  
   Serves as the anchor point for other hyoid bones and supports the base of the tongue.

2. **Thyrohyoid Bones (2)** – Paired bones extending caudally from the basihyoid toward the larynx.  
   Connect to the thyroid cartilage and stabilize the larynx during swallowing and vocalization.

3. **Ceratohyoid Bones (2)** – Connect the basihyoid with the epihyoid.  
   Provide linkage between the central and upper elements, allowing flexibility for tongue and laryngeal motion.

4. **Epihyoid Bones (2)** – Small slender bones connecting the ceratohyoid and stylohyoid bones.  
   Serve as part of the flexible bridge within the apparatus.

5. **Stylohyoid Bones (2)** – The longest and most dorsal elements.  
   Extend upward and backward to attach near the skull’s tympanohyoid cartilage.  
   Support the tongue and larynx and assist in swallowing motion.

6. **Tympanohyoid Cartilage** – Connective segment linking the stylohyoid bone to the temporal bone.  
   Acts as a flexible attachment to the skull, permitting limited movement.

##Function##
 Supports the tongue, larynx, and pharynx.  
 Provides structural alignment for swallowing, vocalization, and respiration.  
 Serves as an anchor for muscles controlling tongue and throat movements.  
 Allows flexible yet stable articulation between the mouth and throat structures.  
 Contributes to coordinated actions during eating, drinking, and barking.

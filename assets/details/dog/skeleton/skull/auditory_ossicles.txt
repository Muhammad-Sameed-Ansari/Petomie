#Auditory Ossicles#

##Location##
Located within the middle ear cavity, inside the temporal bone.  
The auditory ossicles are three small interconnected bones that transmit sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.  
They are suspended by ligaments and function as a mechanical linkage system for hearing.

###Parts###
1. **Malleus (Hammer)** – The most external ossicle attached to the eardrum (tympanic membrane).  
   Receives vibrations from the eardrum and transfers them to the incus.  
   Composed of a head, neck, and handle (manubrium) that maintains contact with the tympanic membrane.

2. **Incus (Anvil)** – The middle ossicle connecting the malleus and stapes.  
   Functions as a lever, amplifying and transmitting vibrations from the malleus to the stapes.  
   Has a short and long process, allowing precise articulation between the two other ossicles.

3. **Stapes (Stirrup)** – The innermost ossicle, attached to the oval window of the cochlea.  
   Transmits vibrations from the incus into the fluid-filled inner ear.  
   The smallest bone in the body, shaped like a stirrup, with a base (footplate) that moves against the oval window membrane.

##Function##
 Transmit and amplify sound vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.  
 Facilitate efficient mechanical energy transfer to the cochlea for sound perception.  
 Protect the inner ear from loud sounds through the reflex action of attached muscles.  
 Maintain auditory sensitivity and balance in response to environmental sounds.

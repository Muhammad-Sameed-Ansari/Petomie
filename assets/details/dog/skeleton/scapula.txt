#Scapula#

##Location##
The scapula, or shoulder blade, lies on the side of the dog’s thorax, connecting the forelimb to the body through a muscular sling.  
It extends from the top of the shoulder down toward the upper arm, allowing a wide range of motion for running and jumping.

###Shape###
A broad, flat, triangular bone with a ridge (spine) across one surface.  
The lower end forms a shallow socket (glenoid cavity) where the humerus articulates.

###Parts###

Energetically, it represents strength, alignment, and focus.

##Supraspinous Fossa##

##Infraspinous Fossa##

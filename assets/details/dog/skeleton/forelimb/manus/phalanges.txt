#Phalanges#

##Location##
Located in the distal portion of the limb, forming the single functional digit of the horse.
Extend distally from the metacarpus or metatarsus to the hoof, connecting the fetlock, pastern, and coffin joints.
Each limb contains three phalanges, aligned vertically below the cannon bone.

##Shape##
First Phalanx (P1 – Long Pastern Bone): elongated, cylindrical bone between the fetlock and pastern joints. Provides a strong lever for movement and shock absorption.
Second Phalanx (P2 – Short Pastern Bone): shorter, wedge-shaped bone located between P1 and P3; articulates with both to form the pastern and coffin joints.
Third Phalanx (P3 – Coffin Bone): triangular, flattened bone enclosed within the hoof capsule. Its front surface follows the shape of the hoof wall, and its solar surface provides attachment for the deep digital flexor tendon.
Each phalanx is linked by strong ligaments that stabilize the digit and absorb concussive forces.

##Function##
Provide structure, leverage, and mobility for the distal limb.
Support the horse’s body weight and distribute impact forces through the limb during locomotion.
Serve as attachment sites for tendons and ligaments that control flexion, extension, and stabilization.
The coffin bone (P3) forms the framework of the hoof and bears much of the body’s weight during stance and movement.
Together, the phalanges ensure smooth motion, shock absorption, and balance during gait.

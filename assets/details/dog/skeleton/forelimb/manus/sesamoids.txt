#Sesamoids#

##Location##
Found at key joint regions of the distal limb, primarily where tendons pass over joints.
In the forelimb, the proximal sesamoid bones are located at the back of the fetlock joint (metacarpophalangeal joint), one on each side of the distal end of the third metacarpal bone.
The distal sesamoid bone (navicular bone) lies behind the distal interphalangeal joint between the second and third phalanges, within the hoof capsule.

##Shape##
Proximal sesamoids: small, wedge-shaped bones embedded within the suspensory ligament at the back of the fetlock.
Distal sesamoid (navicular bone): boat-shaped, flattened bone positioned horizontally behind the coffin joint.
Both types are smooth and covered in cartilage where tendons glide over them.

##Function##
Act as pulley points for flexor tendons, reducing friction and stress during movement.
Distribute pressure across the fetlock and coffin joints to prevent overextension.
Provide stability and support during weight-bearing, especially in the stance phase of locomotion.
Play a vital role in the stay apparatus, allowing the horse to stand for long periods without muscular fatigue.
The navicular bone specifically assists in the smooth passage of the deep digital flexor tendon beneath the hoof.

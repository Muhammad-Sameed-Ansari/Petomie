#Metacarpals#

##Location##
Situated between the carpus (knee joint) and the fetlock joint in the forelimb.
Form the main part of the lower limb’s shaft, connecting the forearm to the digit.
The horse has one large, central metacarpal bone (the third metacarpal) and two smaller, vestigial ones on either side.

##Shape##
Third Metacarpal (Cannon Bone): large, cylindrical bone forming the main weight-bearing structure of the lower forelimb.
Second and Fourth Metacarpals (Medial and Lateral Splint Bones): slender, rod-like bones fused along the sides of the cannon bone proximally and tapering distally into small nodules.
The cannon bone articulates proximally with the carpal bones and distally with the proximal phalanx and sesamoids at the fetlock joint.
The splint bones are remnants of ancestral multiple digits and are connected to the cannon bone by the interosseous (suspensory) ligament.

##Function##
Act as the main support and shock-transmission structure of the forelimb.
Transfer forces between the carpus and the digit during locomotion.
Provide attachment sites for the suspensory ligament, extensor tendons, and other connective structures that stabilize the fetlock.
The cannon bone bears most of the weight, while the splint bones provide lateral stability and contribute to the limb’s elasticity.
Together, they form the metacarpal region essential for stride strength, propulsion, and balance.

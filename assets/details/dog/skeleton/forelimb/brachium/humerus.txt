#Humerus#

##Location##
Located in the brachium (upper forelimb) between the scapula and the radius/ulna.
Articulates proximally with the scapula at the shoulder joint (glenohumeral joint) and distally with the radius and ulna at the elbow joint.
Lies obliquely downward and backward from the shoulder to the elbow, forming the foundation of the upper forelimb.

##Shape##
A large, strong, slightly curved long bone with distinct features for muscular attachment:
Proximal end: bears the head of the humerus, which articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. Prominent greater and lesser tubercles provide attachment for shoulder and forelimb muscles.
Shaft: thick and cylindrical, slightly twisted to align with the scapula and radius for efficient motion.
Distal end: forms the condyle, articulating with the radius and ulna; includes the lateral and medial epicondyles for muscle attachment, and the olecranon fossa for the ulna’s olecranon process.

##Function##
Acts as the main structural bone of the upper forelimb, linking the shoulder and elbow joints.
Provides leverage and support for muscles responsible for forelimb flexion, extension, and rotation.
Serves as a key anchor point for powerful muscles such as the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and deltoid.
Transmits weight and movement forces between the trunk and lower limb during locomotion, absorbing shock and contributing to stride efficiency.

#Radius#

##Location##
Located on the cranial (front) side of the forearm, parallel to the ulna.
Extends from the elbow joint to the carpus and forms the main weight-bearing bone of the antebrachium.
Proximally articulates with the humerus, and distally with the carpal bones.

##Shape##
A long, slightly curved bone with expanded ends:
Proximal end: broad and concave, articulating with the humeral condyle to form part of the elbow joint.
Shaft: cylindrical and strong, tapering distally while maintaining a smooth cranial surface for muscle attachment.
Distal end: flattened and wider, articulating with the carpus and connected to the ulna by the interosseous ligament.
Together with the ulna, the radius allows both stability and limited rotational movement of the forearm.

##Function##
Serves as the primary weight-supporting bone of the forelimb.
Transmits forces from the humerus to the carpus during locomotion.
Provides broad surfaces for muscle and ligament attachment that control the paw and elbow.
Allows controlled flexion, extension, and limited rotation (pronation and supination) for smooth gait and precise paw placement.

#Proximal Row#

##Location##
The proximal row of the dog’s carpal bones forms the upper part of the carpus (wrist joint) in the forelimb.  
It lies between the distal end of the radius and ulna (forearm bones) above, and the distal carpal row below.  
This joint is located just below the forearm and above the metacarpal region (paw area).

##Shape##
The proximal row of the dog’s carpus consists of three main bones:  
- **Radial carpal bone** – the largest bone, positioned on the medial (inner) side beneath the radius.  
- **Ulnar carpal bone** – located on the lateral (outer) side, articulating with the ulna and supporting part of the wrist.  
- **Accessory carpal bone** – a distinct, rounded bone that projects backward from the joint, forming the visible “heel” of the wrist. It provides leverage for tendons and muscle attachment.

##Function##
- Forms the upper part of the wrist joint, allowing flexion, extension, and limited rotation.  
- Transfers weight and motion forces from the forearm to the paw.  
- Absorbs shock during movement and supports body weight.  
- Provides attachment for ligaments and tendons that stabilize and move the wrist.  
- The accessory carpal bone acts as a lever, aiding in the function of the flexor muscles.

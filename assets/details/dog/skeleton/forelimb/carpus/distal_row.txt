#Distal Row#

##Location##
Situated in the lower part of the carpal (wrist) joint, between the proximal row of carpal bones and the metacarpal bones of the forelimb.
It articulates distally with the bases of the metacarpals and proximally with the proximal row of carpal bones.

##Shape##
Composed of four small, irregularly shaped short bones arranged transversely.
From medial (inner) to lateral (outer) side:
First Carpal Bone (C1) – smallest, may be reduced or absent in some dogs.
Second Carpal Bone (C2) – articulates mainly with the second metacarpal.
Third Carpal Bone (C3) – centrally located, articulates with the third metacarpal.
Fourth Carpal Bone (C4) – largest, articulates with both the fourth and fifth metacarpals.

##Function##
Forms part of the complex carpal joint that provides flexibility and shock absorption during locomotion.
Facilitates weight transfer from the forearm to the paw while allowing controlled flexion and extension of the limb.
Supports stability and articulation with the metacarpals for precise paw movement and traction.

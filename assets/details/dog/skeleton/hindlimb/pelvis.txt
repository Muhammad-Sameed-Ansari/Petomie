#Pelvis#

##Location##
Located at the caudal end of the trunk, forming the bony framework of the pelvic girdle.
Connects the vertebral column (via the sacrum) to the hind limbs through the hip joints.
Lies between the lumbar spine and the tail, enclosing and protecting parts of the reproductive, urinary, and digestive systems within the pelvic cavity.

##Shape##
A strong, irregularly shaped bony structure composed of two hip bones (ossa coxarum), which unite ventrally at the pelvic symphysis and dorsally articulate with the sacrum.
Each hip bone consists of three fused parts:
###Ilium###
The largest and most cranial part, forming the lateral walls of the pelvis and the upper portion of the hip joint.
###Ischium###
Caudal part forming the floor of the pelvis and the ischial tuberosity (the point of the buttock).
###Pubis###
Ventral portion that joins its counterpart at the midline, forming the pubic symphysis.
Together, these create the acetabulum, a deep, cup-shaped cavity where the femur articulates to form the hip joint.

##Function##
Forms a rigid support structure for the attachment of hind limbs and trunk muscles.
Protects internal organs including portions of the urinary bladder, rectum, and reproductive organs.
Provides the socket (acetabulum) for the hip joint, enabling stable limb movement and weight transfer during locomotion.
Acts as a load-bearing bridge between the spine and hind limbs, transmitting propulsion forces from the limbs to the body.
Also serves as an important point of attachment for muscles of the hindquarters, tail, and abdomen.

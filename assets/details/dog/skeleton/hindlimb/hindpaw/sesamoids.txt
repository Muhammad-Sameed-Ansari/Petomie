#Sesamoids#

##Location##
Small bones embedded within tendons near the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the digits.
Commonly found on the plantar surface of the paw.

##Shape##
Small, rounded bones, usually paired at each metatarsophalangeal joint.
They have smooth articular surfaces where they glide against adjacent bones.

##Function##
Protect tendons from compression and friction.
Act as pulleys to increase mechanical efficiency of the flexor tendons.
Contribute to stability and smooth movement of the digital joints.

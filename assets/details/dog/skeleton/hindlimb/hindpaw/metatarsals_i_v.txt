#Metatarsals I–V#

##Location##
Located in the hind paw between the tarsal bones and the phalanges.
Each metatarsal articulates proximally with a tarsal bone and distally with the base of a proximal phalanx.

##Shape##
Five elongated bones numbered I to V from medial to lateral.
Metatarsal I is the smallest and shortest; II–V are progressively larger and bear most of the weight during movement.

##Function##
Support the digits and act as levers during locomotion.
Transfer forces from the tarsus to the toes.
Provide attachment for intrinsic muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the paw.

###Metatarsal I###

##Location##
Most medial and smallest metatarsal.
Articulates proximally with the first tarsal bone and distally with the first phalanx (dewclaw).

##Shape##
Short and slender bone with a small head and narrow shaft.

##Function##
Supports the dewclaw and provides limited motion and sensory balance.

###Metatarsal II###

##Location##
Next to metatarsal I on the medial side of the paw.
Articulates proximally with the second tarsal bone and distally with the second phalanx.

##Shape##
Longer and slightly thicker than metatarsal I, with a robust base for articulation.

##Function##
Supports one of the main weight-bearing digits of the paw.
Provides stability during standing and locomotion.

###Metatarsal III###

##Location##
Centrally positioned between metatarsals II and IV.
Articulates proximally with the central tarsal bone and distally with the third phalanx.

##Shape##
One of the largest metatarsals, long and straight with strong muscular attachments.

##Function##
Acts as a major weight-bearing bone in the paw.
Provides leverage during push-off in movement.

###Metatarsal IV###

##Location##
Lateral to metatarsal III.
Articulates proximally with the fourth tarsal bone and distally with the fourth phalanx.

##Shape##
Similar in size and strength to metatarsal III but slightly more curved.

##Function##
Shares weight-bearing with metatarsal III.
Provides lateral support and flexibility to the paw.

###Metatarsal V###

##Location##
Most lateral metatarsal bone of the hind paw.
Articulates proximally with the fourth tarsal bone and distally with the fifth phalanx.

##Shape##
Shorter and more robust at its base with a slightly curved shaft.

##Function##
Supports the outer digit and contributes to balance, stability, and propulsion during movement.

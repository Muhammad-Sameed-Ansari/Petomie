#Phalanges#

##Location##
Form the skeleton of the digits in the hind paw, distal to the metatarsal bones.
Each of the four main digits (II–V) contains three phalanges: proximal, middle, and distal; digit I (dewclaw) has two.

##Shape##
Small, elongated bones forming flexible joints.
Each distal phalanx ends in an ungual process that supports the claw.

##Function##
Allow flexion and extension of the toes for balance and propulsion.
Provide grip and traction during running or walking.
Support claws used for digging, gripping, and defense.

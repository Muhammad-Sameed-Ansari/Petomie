#Auditory Ossicles#

##Location##
Located within the middle ear cavity (tympanic cavity) inside the temporal bone.

##Shape##
Three tiny articulated bones forming a chain between the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and the inner ear.

##Parts##
Malleus – “Hammer” bone attached to the tympanic membrane, transmits vibrations medially.
Incus – “Anvil” bone articulating between malleus and stapes, relays vibrations.
Stapes – “Stirrup” bone connecting to the oval window of the cochlea, transmitting sound waves to the inner ear.

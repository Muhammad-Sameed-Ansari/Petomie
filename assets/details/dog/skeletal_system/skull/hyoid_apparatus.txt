#Hyoid Apparatus#

##Location##
Located in the throat region, suspended between the skull and larynx. Supports the tongue, larynx, and pharynx, aiding in swallowing and vocalization.

##Shape##
A chain-like series of small paired bones connected by cartilage, forming a U-shaped structure.

##Parts##
Basihyoid – Central unpaired bone forming the base of the apparatus, located on the midline.
Thyrohyoid – Paired bones connecting the basihyoid to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx.
Ceratohyoid – Paired bones connecting basihyoid to epihyoid.
Epihyoid – Small paired bones linking ceratohyoid to stylohyoid.
Stylohyoid – Long paired bones extending dorsally to the temporal bone, anchoring the hyoid to the skull.

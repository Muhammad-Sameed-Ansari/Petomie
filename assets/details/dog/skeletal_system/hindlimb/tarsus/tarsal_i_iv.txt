#Tarsals Iâ€“IV#

##Location##
Located in the distal row of the tarsus (hock), just proximal to the metatarsals.

##Shape##
Small cuboidal bones arranged from medial (I) to lateral (IV). Tarsal IV is the largest and articulates with two metatarsals.

##Parts##
###Tarsal I###
Most medial distal tarsal
Articulates with metatarsal I (if present)
###Tarsal II###
Medial distal tarsal
Articulates with metatarsal II
###Tarsal III###
Central distal tarsal
Articulates with metatarsal III
###Tarsal IV###
Largest, most lateral distal tarsal
Articulates with both metatarsal IV and V

##Function##
Form the distal tarsal joint row
Provide articulation and weight transfer to the metatarsals
Support hock flexibility and shock absorption during locomotion

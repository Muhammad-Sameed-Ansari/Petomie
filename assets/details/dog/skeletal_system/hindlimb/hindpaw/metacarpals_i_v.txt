#Metacarpals I–V#

##Location##
Located in the forepaw (manus), distal to the carpus and proximal to the digits.

##Shape##
Five long bones arranged in parallel. Metacarpal I is the shortest and supports the dewclaw, while II–V are progressively longer and bear weight.

##Parts##
###Metacarpal I###
Shortest metacarpal
Supports dewclaw digit (digit I)
Non–weight-bearing
###Metacarpal II###
Medial weight-bearing metacarpal
Articulates with carpal II
###Metacarpal III###
Central and typically strongest metacarpal
Articulates with carpal III
###Metacarpal IV###
Lateral weight-bearing metacarpal
Articulates with carpal IV
###Metacarpal V###
Most lateral metacarpal
Weight-bearing but slightly smaller than IV

##Function##
Form the palm of the forepaw
Support body weight (II–V)
Transmit forces to digits during locomotion

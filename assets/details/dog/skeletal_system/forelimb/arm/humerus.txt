#Humerus#

##Location##
Runs between the scapula and the radius/ulna. It forms the upper part of the forelimb and connects the shoulder joint (proximally) with the elbow joint (distally).

##Shape##
Long bone with a slightly curved shaft, thick proximal end (head) forming the shoulder joint, and expanded distal end forming part of the elbow joint.

##Parts##
###Proximal End###
Head of Humerus – smooth, rounded articular surface; fits into glenoid cavity of scapula
Neck of Humerus – narrow region just below the head
Greater Tubercle – large lateral projection; attachment for supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and part of deep pectoral muscles
Lesser Tubercle – smaller medial projection; attachment for subscapularis muscle
Intertubercular Groove (Bicipital Groove) – groove between tubercles; passage for biceps brachii tendon
###Shaft (Body)###
Long cylindrical portion connecting proximal and distal ends
Provides origin/attachment points for brachial muscles (triceps, brachialis, etc.)
###Distal End###
Condyle of Humerus – distal articular region forming part of the elbow joint, divided into:
Trochlea – medial portion, articulates with ulna
Capitulum – lateral portion, articulates with radius
Lateral Epicondyle – roughened area lateral to capitulum; origin of extensor muscles
Medial Epicondyle – larger roughened area medial to trochlea; origin of flexor muscles
Olecranon Fossa – deep depression on caudal surface, receives olecranon of ulna during elbow extension
Radial Fossa – shallow depression on cranial surface, accommodates radial head during elbow flexion

##Function##
Acts as the main weight-bearing and force-transmitting bone of the upper forelimb.
Provides lever arms for major muscles controlling shoulder and elbow flexion/extension.

#Carpals Iâ€“IV#

##Location##
Located in the distal row of the carpus, just proximal to the metacarpals.

##Shape##
Small cuboidal bones arranged from medial (I) to lateral (IV). Carpal IV is the largest and articulates with two metacarpals.

##Parts##
###Carpal I###
Most medial distal carpal
Articulates with metacarpal I (dewclaw digit)
###Carpal II###
Medial distal carpal
Articulates with metacarpal II
###Carpal III###
Central distal carpal
Articulates with metacarpal III
###Carpal IV###
Largest, most lateral distal carpal
Articulates with both metacarpal IV and V

##Function##
Form the distal carpal joint row
Provide articulation and weight transfer to the metacarpals
Allow shock absorption and flexibility of the carpus

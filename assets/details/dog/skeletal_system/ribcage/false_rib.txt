#False Ribs (Costae Spuriae)#

##Location##
Located caudally on the thorax, after the nine true ribs. False ribs are pairs 10, 11, and 12 in the dog. They attach dorsally to the thoracic vertebrae but do not connect directly to the sternum. Instead, their costal cartilages join together to form the costal arch.

##Shape##
Similar in form to the true ribs but slightly longer, narrower, and more caudally sloped.

##Parts##
###Rib 10###
First false rib
Costal cartilage joins with cartilage of rib 9 and 11 to form part of costal arch
Protects caudal lung lobes and cranial portion of diaphragm
###Rib 11###
Middle false rib
Similar length to rib 10
Intercostal space between ribs 11 and 12 is a common site for surgical access to the thorax (thoracotomy)
###Rib 12###
Last false rib before the floating rib
More flexible due to longer costal cartilage
Provides protection to cranial abdominal organs and diaphragm attachment

##Clinical Significance##
###EXPANDABLE_START###Clinical Examination Points
###EXPAND_ITEM_START###Palpation Techniques
The false ribs can be palpated by running fingers along the lateral chest wall. Rib 10 is easily identified as the first rib that doesn't connect directly to the sternum. Gentle pressure should be applied to assess for pain, swelling, or irregularities.

Key palpation points include:
• Lateral chest wall examination
• Intercostal space assessment
• Costal arch evaluation
• Pain response testing

Clinical findings may indicate rib fractures, muscle strain, or underlying pathology. Always compare bilateral symmetry during examination.

On lateral radiographs, false ribs appear as curved radiopaque structures. The costal arch formed by their cartilages creates a distinctive pattern. Rib 11 is often used as a landmark for thoracotomy procedures.

Radiographic considerations:
• Lateral projection optimal for false rib visualization
• Costal arch pattern assessment
• Intercostal space measurement
• Comparison with contralateral side

The false ribs provide excellent anatomical landmarks for surgical planning and diagnostic imaging interpretation.

###EXPAND_ITEM_START###Common Pathologies
False ribs are susceptible to fractures during trauma. Rib 12 fractures are particularly concerning as they may indicate abdominal organ damage. Intercostal muscle strain between ribs 11-12 is common in athletic dogs.

Pathological conditions include:

**Traumatic Injuries:**
Blunt force trauma commonly affects ribs 11-12 due to their exposed position. Multiple rib fractures may indicate severe chest trauma requiring immediate intervention.

**Degenerative Changes:**
Age-related changes include cartilage calcification and reduced flexibility. These changes may affect respiratory mechanics in older animals.

**Surgical Complications:**
Post-thoracotomy complications can include intercostal neuralgia, chronic pain, and reduced chest wall mobility. Proper surgical technique minimizes these risks.

##Function##
Form the caudal portion of the thoracic cage while allowing flexibility for breathing and abdominal movement.
Help complete the costal arch, which provides a protective boundary for internal organs.

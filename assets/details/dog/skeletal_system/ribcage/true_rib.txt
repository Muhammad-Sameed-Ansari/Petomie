#True Ribs (Costae Verae)#

##Location##
Located on the lateral walls of the thorax. True ribs are the first nine pairs of ribs in the dog. They attach dorsally to the thoracic vertebrae and connect ventrally to the sternum via costal cartilages.

##Shape##
Curved, elongated bones with a bony dorsal portion and a flexible cartilaginous ventral portion, forming the rigid but expandable thoracic cage.

##Parts##
###Rib 1###
Shortest, widest, and most curved rib
Lies at the thoracic inlet
Strongly attached to the manubrium of the sternum
Attachment site for scalenus and serratus ventralis muscles
###Rib 2###
Slightly longer, less curved than rib 1
Connects to the second sternebra
Serves as attachment for intercostal muscles and pectoral muscles
###Rib 3###
More elongated than rib 2
Begins forming a smoother curve along the thorax
Intercostal muscles attach between ribs 2 and 3
###Rib 4###
Similar in structure to rib 3 but slightly longer
Forms part of the widest portion of the ribcage
###Rib 5###
Lies approximately at the level of the heart
Costal cartilage attaches to the fifth sternebra
Important in thoracic auscultation window (heart sounds)
###Rib 6###
Slightly longer and more caudally sloped
Part of the main thoracic cage expansion during breathing
###Rib 7###
Still classified as true rib; attaches directly to the sternum
Transition area between cranial and caudal thorax
###Rib 8###
Narrower and longer than ribs 5–7
Part of the caudal thoracic cage; contributes to lung field protection
###Rib 9###
Last true rib
Costal cartilage still directly meets the sternum
Important landmark for transition to false ribs (10–12)

##Function##
Form a protective cage for heart and lungs
Provide attachment for intercostal, serratus, and scalenus muscles
Allow expansion and contraction of thorax during breathing

#Sternum#

##Location##
Located on the ventral midline of the thorax. The sternum forms the floor of the thoracic cage and provides ventral attachment for the costal cartilages of the true ribs (1–9) and the costal arch (10–12).

##Shape##
Series of eight individual bones (sternebrae) forming a rod-like structure. Cranially, the sternum is broader (manubrium), and caudally it tapers (xiphoid process).

##Parts##
###Manubrium###
Cranial-most sternebra
Longest and most prominent
Projects slightly forward beyond the first rib pair
Serves as a palpable landmark for the thoracic inlet
###Sternebrae (2–7)###
Intermediate sternebrae form the body of the sternum
Each sternebra connects to the costal cartilage of a corresponding true rib
Joints between sternebrae allow slight flexibility
###Xiphoid Process###
Caudal-most sternebra
Narrow and flattened with a cartilaginous extension (xiphoid cartilage)
Serves as attachment for linea alba and abdominal muscles
Important palpable landmark for diaphragm and cranial abdominal region

##Function##
Provides ventral support to the thorax
Serves as the main anchor for costal cartilages of the ribs
Protects ventral thoracic organs and gives attachment to thoracic and abdominal muscles

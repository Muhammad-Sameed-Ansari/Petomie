#Upper Molars#

##Location##
Located in the maxilla (upper jaw) caudal to the premolars. Dogs normally have two upper molars on each side (M1 and M2), for a total of four upper molars.

##Shape##
Broad, multi-rooted teeth with flat or slightly cusped crowns adapted for crushing and grinding food.

##Parts##
###Molar 1 (M1)###
Largest upper molar
Three roots (two buccal, one palatal)
Works with lower molar 1 (M1) to crush and grind food
Located directly caudal to the upper carnassial (P4)
###Molar 2 (M2)###
Smaller than M1
Two roots
Contributes to grinding but with less force than M1
Last tooth in the upper dental arcade
(Some dogs may have a very small Molar 3 (M3) or may lack it entirely â€” this is considered normal variation.)

##Function##
Crushing and grinding food into smaller, digestible pieces
Assist in breaking down dry kibble and plant matter
Work with premolars to complete the shearing action

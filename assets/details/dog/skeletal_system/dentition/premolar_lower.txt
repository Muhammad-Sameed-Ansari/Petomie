#Lower Premolars#

##Location##
Located in the mandible (lower jaw) caudal to the lower canines and cranial to the lower molars. Dogs normally have four lower premolars on each side (left and right).

##Shape##
Sharp, multi-cusped teeth that increase in size from P1 to P4. Most have two roots (except P1, which has one). They are positioned slightly rostral compared to their upper counterparts, creating the characteristic shearing action of the scissor bite.

##Parts##
###Premolar 1 (P1)###
Smallest lower premolar
Single root
Often considered vestigial, used more for nibbling and grooming than chewing
###Premolar 2 (P2)###
Slightly larger, two roots
Begins the shearing function of the lower arcade
###Premolar 3 (P3)###
Larger crown with sharper cusps
Two roots
Stronger shearing surface for meat and fibrous tissue
###Premolar 4 (P4)###
Largest of the lower premolars
Two roots
Functions as a powerful shearing blade against upper carnassial (P4)

##Function##
Designed primarily for shearing and slicing food
Work with upper premolars and carnassial to cut meat and crush small bones
Assist in maintaining proper occlusion and scissor bite

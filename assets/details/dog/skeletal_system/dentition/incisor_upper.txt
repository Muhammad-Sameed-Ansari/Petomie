#Upper Incisors#

##Location##
Located in the premaxilla (upper jaw) at the front of the mouth, between the upper canines. Dogs have six upper incisors, three on each side of the midline.

##Shape##
Small, chisel-shaped teeth with a single root each. The crowns are narrow and curved to help grip and nip.

##Parts##
###Incisor 1 (Central Incisor)###
Medial-most tooth, located on each side of the midline
Smallest of the upper incisors
Important for grasping and nibbling
###Incisor 2 (Intermediate Incisor)###
Located between incisor 1 and incisor 3
Slightly larger than incisor 1
Helps with grooming and scraping meat from bone
###Incisor 3 (Corner Incisor)###
Largest of the incisors, located next to the canine tooth
Stronger crown and root
Important for holding and tearing food before canines engage

##Function##
Used for nibbling, grooming (especially removing debris from fur), and grasping food
Play a role in shearing and pulling meat from bones
Assist with delicate prehension before larger teeth (canines and carnassials) take over

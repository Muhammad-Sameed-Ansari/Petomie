#Lower Molars#

##Location##
Located in the mandible (lower jaw) caudal to the premolars. Dogs normally have three lower molars on each side (M1â€“M3), for a total of six lower molars.

##Shape##
Broad, multi-cusped teeth designed for grinding, with two roots (except M3, which has one). They are slightly offset from the upper molars to allow scissor-like action during chewing.

##Parts##
###Molar 1 (M1)###
Largest lower molar
Two roots
Principal crushing tooth of the lower jaw
Works with upper M1 to grind food efficiently
###Molar 2 (M2)###
Smaller than M1
Two roots
Contributes to grinding but with less force than M1
###Molar 3 (M3)###
Smallest lower molar
Single root
Often reduced or absent in some breeds without clinical issues

##Function##
Primary teeth for crushing and grinding kibble, bones, and fibrous material
Assist in the final breakdown of food before swallowing
Work with upper molars and premolars to complete mastication

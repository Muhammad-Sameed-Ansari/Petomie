#Upper Premolars#

##Location##
Located in the maxilla (upper jaw) caudal to the upper canines and cranial to the molars. Dogs normally have four upper premolars on each side (left and right).

##Shape##
Multi-cusped teeth with one to three roots, depending on which premolar. They increase in size from P1 (smallest) to P4 (largest, the upper carnassial tooth).

##Parts##
###Premolar 1 (P1)###
Smallest premolar
Has a single root
Often considered vestigial; primarily for grooming or small food shearing
###Premolar 2 (P2)###
Slightly larger than P1
Has two roots
Participates in shearing food, especially soft tissues
###Premolar 3 (P3)###
Larger crown, two roots
Stronger shearing action, important for mastication
###Premolar 4 (P4) – Upper Carnassial Tooth###
Largest tooth in the upper jaw
Three roots (two buccal, one palatal)
Specialized for slicing meat and shearing bone — main cutting tooth in dogs

##Function##
Shearing and slicing meat and other foods
Work with lower premolars and molars to break down food into smaller pieces
Carnassial (P4) is especially important for cracking bones and tearing flesh

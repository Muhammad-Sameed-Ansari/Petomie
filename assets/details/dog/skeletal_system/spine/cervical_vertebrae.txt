#Cervical Vertebrae (C1–C7)#

##Location##
Form the neck region of the vertebral column, situated between the skull and the thoracic vertebrae. Dogs have seven cervical vertebrae.

##Shape##
Generally smaller and more delicate than thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, with wide range of motion. The first two cervical vertebrae (atlas and axis) are highly specialized to allow head movement.

##Parts##
###C1 – Atlas###
Shape – Ring-like, no vertebral body or spinous process
Cranial Articular Foveae – articulate with occipital condyles of the skull → atlanto-occipital joint (“yes” joint, nodding)
Caudal Articular Foveae – articulate with axis (C2)
Wings of Atlas – palpable lateral projections for muscle attachment
Vertebral Foramen – large canal for spinal cord passage
###C2 – Axis###
Dens (Odontoid Process) – peg-like projection cranially, fits into atlas
Atlantoaxial Joint – allows rotational movement (“no” motion, shaking head)
Spinous Process – long and palpable in live dogs
Transverse Foramen – allows passage of vertebral artery
###C3–C6 (Typical Cervical Vertebrae)###
Have small vertebral bodies
Well-developed transverse processes with foramina (vertebral artery passage)
Short spinous processes
Allow flexion, extension, and some lateral bending of the neck
###C7###
Transitional vertebra between cervical and thoracic regions
No transverse foramen
Tall spinous process, similar to thoracic vertebrae
Costal foveae present for articulation with the first rib

##Function##
Support and protect the spinal cord in the neck
Allow wide range of head and neck motion (flexion, extension, lateral bending, rotation)
Provide passageway for vertebral arteries supplying the brain

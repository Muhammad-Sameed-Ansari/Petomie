#Thoracic Vertebrae (T1–T13)#

##Location##
Form the middle section of the vertebral column, situated between the cervical (neck) and lumbar (lower back) vertebrae. In the dog there are 13 thoracic vertebrae, each corresponding to a pair of ribs.

##Shape##
Irregular bones with a large spinous process, short body, and articulations for ribs. Together they form the bony roof of the thoracic cavity.

##Parts##
###Vertebral Body###
Cylindrical central portion
Bears weight and articulates with intervertebral discs cranially and caudally
###Vertebral Arch###
Forms the dorsal wall of the vertebral canal
Encloses the spinal cord
###Spinous Process###
Large dorsal projection
Most prominent in the cranial thoracic vertebrae (T1–T9), tallest at T4–T5 (withers region)
Provides attachment for epaxial muscles and nuchal ligament
###Transverse Processes###
Project laterally on each side
Articulate with the tubercles of ribs (costotransverse joint)
###Articular Processes###
Cranial Articular Processes – face dorsally, articulate with caudal processes of previous vertebra
Caudal Articular Processes – face ventrally, articulate with cranial processes of following vertebra
###Costal Foveae (Facets)###
Depressions on the vertebral body and transverse process
Articulate with rib heads and tubercles to form costovertebral joints
###Vertebral Foramen###
Central canal through which the spinal cord passes
###Special Notes by Region###
T1 – Short spinous process, resembles cervical vertebra; articulates with first rib
T4–T5 – Tallest spinous processes, forming the withers (highest point of the back)
T10–T13 – Spinous processes gradually shorten caudally; T13 is the last thoracic vertebra and articulates with rib 13 (floating rib)

##Function##
Provide articulation for all ribs, forming the dorsal aspect of the rib cage
Protect the spinal cord within the vertebral canal
Serve as attachment for powerful back and thoracic muscles
Create the withers landmark important in conformation and saddle fitting

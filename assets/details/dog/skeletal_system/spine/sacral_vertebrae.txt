#Sacral Vertebrae (S1–S3)#

##Location##
Located caudal to the lumbar vertebrae and cranial to the caudal (coccygeal) vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae form the roof of the pelvic canal and connect the spine to the pelvis.

##Shape##
Three individual vertebrae (S1, S2, S3) that are fused together in the adult dog to form a single triangular structure — the sacrum.

##Parts##
###S1 (First Sacral Vertebra)###
Largest of the three
Articulates cranially with L7 at the lumbosacral joint
Bears the sacral promontory, a cranial edge important as a radiographic landmark
###S2 (Second Sacral Vertebra)###
Middle vertebra of the sacrum
Provides passage for sacral spinal nerves through dorsal and ventral sacral foramina
###S3 (Third Sacral Vertebra)###
Smallest sacral vertebra
Articulates caudally with the first caudal vertebra (Cd1)
Common Features (All Three Vertebrae)
Sacral Wings (Alae) – lateral wing-like projections of S1 forming the sacroiliac joint with the ilium
Median Sacral Crest – dorsal midline ridge formed by fused spinous processes
Dorsal & Ventral Sacral Foramina – paired openings for sacral nerves
Sacral Canal – continuation of vertebral canal carrying cauda equina

##Function##
Transmit weight from the spine to the pelvis and hindlimbs
Provide attachment points for ligaments and muscles stabilizing the pelvis
Allow passage of sacral nerves to hindlimbs, bladder, rectum, and tail

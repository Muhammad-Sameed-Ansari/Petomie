#Caudal (Coccygeal) Vertebrae#

##Location##
Extend caudally from the sacrum (S3) to form the tail. The number varies by breed, typically 20–23 vertebrae in dogs.

##Shape##
Start as well-formed vertebrae near the sacrum, then gradually become smaller and more rod-like toward the tip of the tail.

##Parts##
###Proximal Caudal Vertebrae (Cd1–Cd6)###
Resemble small lumbar vertebrae
Have vertebral bodies, arches, and articular processes
Allow limited movement at the tail base
Protect caudal spinal nerves in the cauda equina region
###Middle Caudal Vertebrae (Cd7–Cd15)###
Progressive simplification of structure
Vertebral arches become reduced or disappear
Articular processes are small or absent
Function mainly as support and to maintain tail flexibility
###Distal Caudal Vertebrae (Cd16–Cd20+)###
Simple rod-like bones, sometimes just cylindrical ossicles
No vertebral arches
Provide shape to the tail tip

##Function##
Allow flexible tail movement for communication, balance, and emotional expression
Provide attachment points for tail muscles and ligaments
Assist with balance and steering during locomotion and jumping
Aid in insect control by swishing the tail

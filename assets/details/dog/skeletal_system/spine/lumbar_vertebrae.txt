#Lumbar Vertebrae (L1–L7)#

##Location##
Situated caudal to the thoracic vertebrae and cranial to the sacrum. The lumbar vertebrae form the lower back region of the spine. Dogs have seven lumbar vertebrae.

##Shape##
Large, robust vertebrae with long bodies and prominent transverse processes, designed to support more weight than the thoracic vertebrae.

##Parts##
###Vertebral Body###
Long and strong, adapted for weight-bearing
Intervertebral discs between bodies provide cushioning and flexibility
###Vertebral Arch###
Forms the vertebral canal, protecting the spinal cord
###Spinous Process###
Large, broad, and plate-like
###Directed cranially###
Provide attachment for epaxial muscles that support and extend the spine
###Transverse Processes###
Very long, projecting laterally
Provide attachment sites for abdominal wall muscles (psoas major, quadratus lumborum)
###Articular Processes###
Cranial Articular Processes – face medially
Caudal Articular Processes – face laterally
This orientation limits lateral flexion but allows dorsoventral flexion/extension
###Accessory Processes###
Small projections found on L1–L5 near the caudal end of the vertebrae
Serve as additional muscle and ligament attachment sites
###Vertebral Foramen###
Canal through which the cauda equina and spinal nerves pass in the lumbar region
###Special Notes by Region###
L1–L3 – Transitional vertebrae with some similarity to caudal thoracic vertebrae
L4–L6 – Longest transverse processes, forming palpable ""wings""
L7 – Last lumbar vertebra; articulates with sacrum at lumbosacral joint

##Function##
Support the weight of the caudal body and transmit forces from hind limbs to the trunk
Provide flexibility for dorsoventral movement (arching and extending the back)
Protect cauda equina and lumbar spinal cord

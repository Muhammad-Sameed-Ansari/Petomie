#Pudendal Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: Originates from S1–S3 and serves the perineum, external genitalia, and anal sphincter.  
Energetically, it represents grounding, security, and boundaries — the foundation of safety and control.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Formed by ventral branches of S1–S3.  
Energetically, symbolizes rooted stability and balance.

##Pathway##  
Runs through the pelvic canal toward the perineum.  
Energetically, reflects grounding and protection.

##Branches##  
Caudal rectal, perineal, and dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris.  
Energetically, express trust and inner strength.

###Function###  
Controls anal and urethral sphincters and provides sensory input to the perineal region.  
Energetically, maintains integrity, safety, and balance between release and retention.

###Common Imbalances###  
Pain: anxiety or boundary strain.  
Numbness: disconnection or avoidance.  
Energetic blockage: fear of exposure or loss of control.

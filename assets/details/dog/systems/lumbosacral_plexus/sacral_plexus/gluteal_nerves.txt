#Gluteal Nerves#
Part of the Nervous System: Branches of the lumbosacral plexus (L6–S1) that control the gluteal muscles and hip motion.  
Energetically, they represent propulsion, balance, and confident strength — the drive to move forward with ease.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arise from ventral branches of L6–S1.  
Energetically, symbolize courage and dynamic movement.

##Pathway##  
Travel outward through the pelvis to the gluteal region.  
Energetically, reflect harmony in strength and flexibility.

##Branches##  
Cranial and caudal gluteal nerves.  
Energetically, express balanced power and flow.

###Function###  
Innervate the superficial, middle, and deep gluteal muscles.  
Enable extension and abduction of the hip.  
Energetically, provide stability, grace, and confidence in action.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: hesitation or fear of progress.  
Pain: stored tension or resistance.  
Energetic stagnation: loss of motivation or vitality.

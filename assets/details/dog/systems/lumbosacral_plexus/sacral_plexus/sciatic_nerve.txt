#Sciatic Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: The largest nerve of the body, arising from L6–S2 and supplying the hind limb.  
Energetically, it represents endurance, grounded strength, and flow — movement guided by stability and trust.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Comes from ventral branches of L6–S2.  
Energetically, symbolizes structure, strength, and connection.

##Pathway##  
Runs caudally through the pelvis, along the femur, dividing into the tibial and peroneal nerves.  
Energetically, reflects flow, freedom, and balanced drive.

##Branches##  
Tibial and common peroneal nerves.  
Energetically, represent flexibility and progression.

###Function###  
Controls movement and sensation of the thigh, leg, and paw.  
Enables coordination and propulsion in motion.  
Energetically, supports confidence, purpose, and progress.

###Common Imbalances###  
Pain: restriction or fear of motion.  
Weakness: low drive or imbalance.  
Energetic stagnation: blocked flow or fear of release.

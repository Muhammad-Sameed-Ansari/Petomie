#Obturator Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: A nerve of the lumbar plexus (L4–L6) that innervates the adductor muscles of the inner thigh.  
Energetically, it represents balance, focus, and centered stability — the ability to act with control and grace.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Emerges from L4–L6 spinal nerves in the lumbar plexus.  
Energetically, symbolizes centered strength and grounded coordination.

##Pathway##  
Travels through the pelvic cavity and exits via the obturator foramen to reach the medial thigh.  
Energetically, reflects inner alignment and direction.

##Branches##  
Motor to adductor muscles and gracilis.  
Energetically, supports graceful control and balanced motion.

###Function###  
Adducts the hind limb, maintaining balance during standing and walking.  
Energetically, ensures centeredness and harmony of movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weak adduction: instability or imbalance.  
Pain: tension or fear of control.  
Energetic stagnation: indecision or emotional imbalance.

#Femoral Nerve#
Part of the Nervous System: A major branch of the lumbar plexus (originating from L4–L6) that innervates the quadriceps femoris and provides sensory input to the medial hind limb.  
Energetically, it represents strength, courage, and grounded motion — the will to move forward with stability and power.

###Parts###

##Origin##  
Arises from the ventral branches of L4–L6 within the lumbar plexus.  
Energetically, symbolizes foundation, direction, and core vitality.

##Pathway##  
Passes through the iliopsoas muscle and under the inguinal ligament to the thigh.  
Energetically, reflects smooth flow and forward drive.

##Branches##  
Motor to quadriceps femoris, sensory via the saphenous nerve.  
Energetically, expresses empowerment and confident movement.

###Function###  
Extends the stifle and aids in weight-bearing and forward propulsion.  
Energetically, provides strength, coordination, and clarity in action.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: instability or lack of confidence.  
Pain: fear of movement or suppressed drive.  
Energetic stagnation: hesitation or resistance to progress.

#Brachial Plexus#
Part of the Nervous System: A complex network of nerves formed by spinal nerves C6–T2 that controls the forelimb.  
Energetically, it represents coordination, communication, and purposeful movement — the harmony of will and action.

###Parts###

##Roots##  
Derived from ventral branches of C6–T2.  
Energetically, symbolize connection between mind and body.

##Trunks and Cords##  
Combine and distribute signals to major peripheral nerves.  
Energetically, reflect organization and unity in action.

##Major Branches##  
Include radial, median, ulnar, musculocutaneous, and axillary nerves.  
Energetically, express balance between strength and sensitivity.

###Function###  
Controls motor and sensory function of the forelimb and shoulder.  
Energetically, maintains harmony between action and intuition.

###Common Imbalances###  
Weakness: loss of control or fear of reaching.  
Compression: emotional tension or resistance.

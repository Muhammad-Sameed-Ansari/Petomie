#Kidneys#

##Location##
Situated in the upper abdominal cavity on either side of the spine, just behind the last ribs.
The right kidney lies slightly more forward than the left, positioned close to the liver.
Both are supported by surrounding fat and connective tissue within the retroperitoneal space.

###Shape###
Paired, smooth, reddish-brown, bean-shaped organs with a firm outer capsule.
Each kidney has a convex lateral surface and a concave medial surface where the renal hilus (entry for vessels and ureter) is located.

##Parts##
###1. Cortex###
The outer layer containing nephrons, the microscopic filtering units that remove waste from blood.
###2. Medulla###
The inner region consisting of renal pyramids and collecting ducts that channel urine toward the renal pelvis.
###3. Renal Pelvis###
The central cavity that gathers urine from the medulla and funnels it into the ureter.
###4. Renal Hilus###
Indented medial area where the renal artery, vein, lymphatics, and ureter enter and exit the kidney.

##Function##
Filters metabolic waste and toxins from the bloodstream.
Regulates fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and blood pressure.
Maintains acid–base homeostasis for optimal cellular function.
Produces hormones such as erythropoietin (stimulates red blood cell formation) and renin (regulates blood pressure).
Contributes to the body’s detoxification and water conservation systems.

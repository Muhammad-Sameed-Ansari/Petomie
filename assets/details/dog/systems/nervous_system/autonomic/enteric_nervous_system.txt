#Enteric Nervous System#

##Location##
The enteric nervous system (ENS) is found in the walls of the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum.
It is made up of millions of small nerve cells that form two main layers:

Myenteric Plexus: controls muscle movement of the intestines.

Submucosal Plexus: controls secretions and blood flow in the gut wall.

###Shape###
A web-like network of tiny nerves that spread through the entire gut, forming a separate “mini nervous system.”
It can work independently but also communicates with the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

##Function##
The ENS controls all automatic movements and secretions of the digestive system.

Moves food through the stomach and intestines (peristalsis).

Regulates enzyme and acid production for digestion.

Controls blood flow in the digestive tract.

Monitors stretch and pressure in the stomach and intestines.

Communicates with the brain through the gut–brain connection, helping the dog sense fullness, hunger, or discomfort.

##Examples##
When a dog eats, the enteric system automatically starts moving food through the gut and releases digestive juices.
If something upsets the stomach, the ENS detects it and triggers nausea or vomiting to protect the body.

##Notes##
The enteric system keeps digestion balanced and smooth.
Stress, diet changes, or illness can disturb it, leading to stomach upset or irregular stools.
A calm environment, regular feeding, and clean water support healthy gut nerve function.

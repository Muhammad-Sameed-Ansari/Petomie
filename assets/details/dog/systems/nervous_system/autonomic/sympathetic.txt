#Sympathetic Nervous System#

##Location##
The sympathetic nervous system runs mainly along the middle and lower back region of the spinal cord.
Its nerve fibers leave the spinal cord between T1 and L4 and connect to two long chains of nerve centers (ganglia) that sit beside the spine.
From there, the nerves branch out to the heart, lungs, eyes, digestive system, skin, and blood vessels.

###Shape###
Two long chains of small nerve clusters connected by thin fibers, like a ladder running along both sides of the spine.
Each cluster sends tiny nerve branches to different organs and tissues.

##Function##
The sympathetic system prepares the dog’s body to act quickly in stressful or active situations.
It is often called the “fight or flight” system.

Increases heart rate and blood pressure to pump more oxygen to muscles.

Expands airways to breathe easier.

Widens pupils for sharper vision.

Redirects blood away from the stomach to the muscles.

Reduces saliva and digestion when the dog is excited or scared.

Releases stored energy from the liver and fat for quick use.

Activates sweat glands (especially in paw pads).

##Examples##
When a dog gets startled, sees another dog, or runs after a toy — the sympathetic system speeds up the heart, breathing, and muscles for fast action.

##Notes##
Too much sympathetic activity (from stress or fear) can cause tension, poor digestion, or anxiety.
Rest, calm routines, and safe surroundings help bring this system back into balance.

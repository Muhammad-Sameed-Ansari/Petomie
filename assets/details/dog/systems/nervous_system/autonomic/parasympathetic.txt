#Parasympathetic Nervous System#

##Location##
The parasympathetic system starts in the brainstem and the lower end of the spinal cord (sacral area).
The vagus nerve, which travels from the brain down through the neck, connects to the heart, lungs, and digestive organs.
Other smaller nerves reach the eyes, salivary glands, bladder, and intestines.

###Shape###
Long nerve fibers travel from the brain and spinal cord to small control centers (ganglia) near or inside the organs.
From there, short branches connect directly to the muscles or glands they control.

##Function##
The parasympathetic system helps the body rest, digest, and recover after activity.
It is the opposite of the sympathetic system and works to bring the body back to normal.

Slows down the heart rate and lowers blood pressure.

Stimulates digestion and saliva flow.

Increases gut movement for healthy digestion.

Constricts pupils back to normal size.

Helps with urination and bowel movements.

Encourages healing and relaxation after stress or exercise.

##Examples##
After eating or during rest, the parasympathetic system helps the dog relax, digest food, and breathe deeply.
When the dog feels calm and safe, this system is dominant.

##Notes##
The parasympathetic system helps the body recharge and recover.
Regular rest, calm feeding, and gentle interactions support its healthy function.

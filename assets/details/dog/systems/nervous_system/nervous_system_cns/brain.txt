#Brain#

##Location##
Located within the cranial cavity of the skull and protected by the cranial bones and meninges.  
It connects to the spinal cord through the foramen magnum and serves as the control center of the dog’s nervous system.

###Parts###
1. **Cerebrum** – The largest and most developed part of the brain.  
   Divided into left and right hemispheres, it manages voluntary movement, learning, memory, and behavior.  
   Interprets sensory information such as vision, hearing, and touch, and regulates decision-making and awareness.

2. **Cerebellum** – Positioned below and behind the cerebrum.  
   Coordinates posture, movement, balance, and muscle tone.  
   Ensures smooth and accurate motion during running, jumping, and precise body control.

3. **Brainstem** – Includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.  
   Serves as the communication link between the brain and spinal cord.  
   Controls involuntary life-support functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and reflex actions.

4. **Diencephalon** – Composed of the thalamus and hypothalamus.  
   The thalamus acts as a relay station for sensory impulses traveling to the cerebrum.  
   The hypothalamus regulates hunger, thirst, temperature, sleep, and emotional behavior, and influences hormonal activity via the pituitary gland.

5. **Pituitary Gland** – Connected to the hypothalamus and functions as the body’s main endocrine gland.  
   Releases hormones that regulate metabolism, growth, stress response, and reproductive cycles.

6. **Olfactory Bulbs** – Situated at the front of the brain above the nasal cavity.  
   Highly developed in dogs, they process scent information crucial for navigation, hunting, and social communication.

##Function##
Controls voluntary movement, coordination, and reflexes.  
Regulates vital systems such as breathing, heart rate, and digestion.  
Processes sensory input from all parts of the body.  
Governs behavior, emotional response, and social interaction.  
Supports memory, learning, and environmental awareness.  
Ensures balance and precise motion during physical activity.

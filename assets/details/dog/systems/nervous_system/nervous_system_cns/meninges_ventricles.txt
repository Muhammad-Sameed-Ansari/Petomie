#Meninges & Ventricles#

##Location##
The meninges are soft layers that cover the brain and spinal cord.  
The ventricles are small spaces inside the brain filled with clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

###Shape###
There are three layers of meninges:  
- **Dura mater** – tough outer layer.  
- **Arachnoid mater** – middle, web-like layer.  
- **Pia mater** – thin inner layer that touches the brain and spinal cord.  
The ventricles are hollow chambers that hold and circulate CSF.

##Function##
- Protects the brain and spinal cord from injury.  
- Cushions the nervous system and keeps it floating safely.  
- Delivers nutrients and removes waste.  
- Keeps the brain at the right pressure and temperature.  
- Supports calm and balanced brain function.

#Spinal Nerves#

##Location##
Spinal nerves branch out from the spinal cord, running through spaces between the vertebrae.
Each segment of the spinal cord gives rise to a pair of nerves — one on each side — forming 36 pairs in total (C1–C8, T1–T13, L1–L7, S1–S3, and Cd1–Cd5).

###Shape###
Short roots that merge into a single mixed nerve, then split into dorsal (sensory) and ventral (motor) branches.
They appear like ladder rungs along the spine, sending smaller nerves to skin, muscles, and organs.

##Function##

Transmit signals between the spinal cord and body.

Motor fibers: control muscle contractions for movement.

Sensory fibers: carry information about touch, pain, and temperature.

Autonomic fibers: control involuntary actions like heart rate and digestion.

Main groups:

Cervical Nerves (C1–C8): control neck and front limb muscles (via brachial plexus).

Thoracic Nerves (T1–T13): connect to chest, ribs, and upper back.

Lumbar Nerves (L1–L7): control back, abdomen, and hind limbs.

Sacral Nerves (S1–S3): affect tail, bladder, and bowel.

Caudal Nerves (Cd1–Cd5): serve the tail and skin around the anus.

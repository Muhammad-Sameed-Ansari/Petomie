#Cranial Nerves#

##Location##
Cranial nerves arise directly from the brain, mostly from the brainstem, and extend to the head, face, neck, and some internal organs.
Dogs have 12 pairs of cranial nerves — one pair on each side of the body.

###Shape###
Small paired nerve bundles that exit the skull through tiny openings (foramina) and spread to muscles, glands, and sensory organs in the head.

##Function##
Each cranial nerve has a specific role — some are sensory, some motor, and some mixed:

Olfactory (I): smell

Optic (II): vision

Oculomotor (III): eye movement and pupil control

Trochlear (IV): moves one eye muscle (superior oblique)

Trigeminal (V): feeling in face and mouth; chewing

Abducens (VI): moves the eyes outward

Facial (VII): facial expression, tear and saliva production, taste on tongue

Vestibulocochlear (VIII): hearing and balance

Glossopharyngeal (IX): taste, swallowing, and salivation

Vagus (X): controls internal organs (heart, lungs, digestion)

Accessory (XI): moves neck and shoulder muscles

Hypoglossal (XII): tongue movement

Together, they control facial movement, hearing, smell, balance, sight, taste, and many reflexes of the head and neck.

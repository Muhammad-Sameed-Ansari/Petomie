#Sensory Nerves#

##Location##
Found throughout the entire body — in the skin, muscles, joints, tendons, and organs.
Receptors are located at the nerve endings and connected to the spinal cord and brain through long nerve fibers.

###Shape###
Tiny receptor endings detect environmental changes (heat, cold, pain, stretch, pressure).
They form long sensory pathways that travel to the spinal cord and then to the brain for interpretation.

##Function##

Detect and send information about:

Touch and pressure

Temperature (hot or cold)

Pain

Vibration

Body position (proprioception)

Help dogs sense where their body is, avoid injury, and react to touch or movement.

Examples include:

Cutaneous nerves: provide feeling to skin.

Muscle spindle nerves: detect muscle stretch and tension.

Joint receptors: sense limb position.

Visceral sensory nerves: sense fullness, pain, or pressure from internal organs.

Healthy sensory nerves let a dog respond quickly to its environment and maintain coordination and balance.

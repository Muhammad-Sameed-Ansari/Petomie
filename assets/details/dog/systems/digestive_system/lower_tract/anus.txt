#Anus#

##Location##
Located at the terminal end of the rectum, forming the final opening of the digestive tract to the outside of the body.
Positioned ventral to the base of the tail and surrounded by specialized muscles that control defecation.

###Shape###
A circular opening bordered by strong muscular rings and surrounded by sensitive skin and mucosa.
These muscles maintain closure except during defecation.

##Parts##
###1. Internal Anal Sphincter###
Composed of smooth muscle under involuntary control.
Provides constant tone to keep the anal opening closed.
###2. External Anal Sphincter###
Made of skeletal muscle under voluntary control.
Allows conscious regulation of fecal release.
###3. Anal Glands (Associated Structures)###
Paired sacs located at approximately 4 and 8 o’clock positions beside the anus.
Produce scent-marking secretions released during defecation or stress.

##Function##
Regulates the controlled release of feces during defecation.
Maintains continence through coordinated action of both sphincters.
Assists in communication and territorial marking via anal gland secretions.
Marks the end of the digestive process and waste elimination pathway.

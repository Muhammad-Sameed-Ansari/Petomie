#Liver#

##Location##
Situated in the cranial abdomen, just behind the diaphragm and in front of the stomach.
It occupies the upper right and central regions of the abdominal cavity and is partially covered by the ribcage.
The gallbladder lies between the right medial and quadrate lobes on the liver’s underside.

###Shape###
A large, reddish-brown, wedge-shaped organ with a smooth outer surface.
Divided into distinct lobes separated by connective tissue, giving it a multi-lobed appearance.

##Parts##
###1. Lobes###
Divided into right lateral, right medial, left lateral, left medial, quadrate, and caudate lobes.
Each lobe contains microscopic functional units called lobules, which carry out metabolic and detoxification processes.
###2. Bile Ducts###
Collect bile produced by liver cells and transport it to the gallbladder for storage or directly to the duodenum for fat digestion.
###3. Blood Vessels###
Hepatic Artery: Supplies oxygen-rich blood.
Portal Vein: Brings nutrient-rich blood from the intestines.
Hepatic Vein: Drains processed blood into the caudal vena cava.
###4. Gallbladder (Associated Structure)###
Small, sac-like organ that stores and concentrates bile before its release into the duodenum.

##Function##
Produces bile to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.
Processes and stores nutrients, glucose, and vitamins absorbed from the intestines.
Detoxifies harmful substances and metabolizes drugs and waste products.
Regulates blood composition by balancing proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
Synthesizes essential plasma proteins such as albumin and clotting factors.
Plays a key role in maintaining energy metabolism and overall body homeostasis.

#Gallbladder#

##Location##
Located on the underside of the liver, nestled between the right medial and quadrate lobes.
It connects to the liver and the duodenum through the bile ducts and sits just behind the ribcage in the upper right abdomen.

###Shape###
A small, pear-shaped, greenish sac with thin elastic walls capable of expansion and contraction.
Its surface is smooth, and it contains stored bile that appears yellow to dark green in color.

##Parts##
###1. Fundus###
The rounded end of the gallbladder that protrudes slightly beyond the liver margin.
###2. Body###
The main central portion where bile is stored and concentrated.
###3. Neck###
The narrow portion that connects to the cystic duct leading into the bile duct system.
###4. Cystic Duct and Common Bile Duct###
Tubes that transport bile from the gallbladder to the duodenum for fat digestion.

##Function##
Stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver.
Releases bile into the small intestine (duodenum) after eating to emulsify fats and aid digestion.
Regulates bile flow through coordinated contractions and relaxation of ducts.
Assists in the removal of waste products such as bilirubin from the body via bile excretion.

#Pancreas#

##Location##
Located in the upper abdomen, nestled between the stomach and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum).
It lies close to the right kidney and the liver, extending along the duodenal loop.

###Shape###
A soft, pale pink, lobulated gland shaped somewhat like an irregular “V.”
It consists of two main lobes (right and left) joined by a central body.

##Parts##
###1. Right Lobe###
Extends along the descending duodenum and is closely associated with the duodenal wall.
Main site for digestive enzyme secretion.
###2. Left Lobe###
Lies toward the stomach and the liver, extending across the abdominal cavity.
###3. Pancreatic Ducts###
Small tubes that collect pancreatic secretions and carry them into the duodenum.
Often join with the bile duct to release enzymes at the major duodenal papilla.
###4. Islets of Langerhans###
Clusters of endocrine cells scattered throughout the gland that produce hormones such as insulin and glucagon.

##Function##
Performs both exocrine and endocrine functions:
Exocrine Function: Produces digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, protease) and bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid in the small intestine.
Endocrine Function: Secretes hormones — insulin (lowers blood sugar), glucagon (raises blood sugar), and somatostatin (regulates secretion).
Aids in digestion, metabolism, and blood sugar balance.
Plays a vital role in nutrient absorption and maintaining energy homeostasis.

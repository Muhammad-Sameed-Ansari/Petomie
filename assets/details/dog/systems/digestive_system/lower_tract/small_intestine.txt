#Small Intestine#

The small intestine is a long, coiled tube where most digestion and nutrient absorption occur.  
Energetically, it represents discernment, learning, and the ability to separate nourishment from waste — physically and emotionally.

###Parts###

##Duodenum##  
First segment receiving food from the stomach.  
Energetically, symbolizes initiation and readiness for transformation.

##Jejunum##  
Middle section where most absorption happens.  
Energetically, reflects learning and integration.

##Ileum##  
Final portion connecting to the large intestine.  
Energetically, represents transition and completion.

###Function###  
Completes digestion, absorbs nutrients, and passes residue to the large intestine.  
Energetically, it mirrors discernment and assimilation of life experiences.

###Common Imbalances###  
Malabsorption: difficulty taking in support.  
Inflammation: frustration or overstimulation.  
Bloating: emotional overload or sensitivity.

#Stomach#

##Location##
Situated in the upper abdomen, slightly to the left side beneath the ribs and behind the liver.
It lies between the esophagus and the small intestine (duodenum) and is part of the upper digestive tract.

###Shape###
A curved, muscular, sac-like organ with thick walls and internal folds called rugae, which allow expansion after eating.
The stomach’s outer surface is smooth, while the inner lining secretes acid and digestive enzymes.

##Parts##
###1. Cardia###
The entry region where the esophagus joins the stomach.
Contains the cardiac sphincter, which prevents backflow of food and acid.
###2. Fundus###
The rounded, upper dome-shaped section that stores swallowed food and gases.
###3. Body###
The largest central portion where food is mixed and broken down by gastric juices and muscular contractions.
###4. Pylorus###
The narrow lower portion leading to the duodenum (first part of the small intestine).
Contains the pyloric sphincter, which regulates the passage of digested food.
###5. Sphincters###
Cardiac Sphincter: Controls entry of food from the esophagus.
Pyloric Sphincter: Controls the release of chyme into the small intestine.

##Function##
Mixes food with hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes to begin protein digestion.
Kills harmful bacteria through gastric acidity.
Breaks food into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme for transfer to the small intestine.
Stores food temporarily and regulates its movement into the intestine.
Assists in nutrient absorption by initiating chemical digestion.

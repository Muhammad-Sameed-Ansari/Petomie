#Pharynx#

##Location##
Located behind the nasal and oral cavities, forming the upper part of both the digestive and respiratory tracts.
It extends from the base of the skull to the beginning of the esophagus and larynx.

###Shape###
A muscular, funnel-shaped tube lined with mucous membrane, connecting the nasal and oral passages to the larynx and esophagus.

##Parts##

###1. Nasopharynx###
Upper section located behind the nasal cavity; connects to the nasal passages and helps conduct air to the larynx.

###2. Oropharynx###
Middle section located behind the mouth; shared by both food and air pathways.

###3. Laryngopharynx###
Lower section leading to the esophagus (for food) and larynx (for air).

##Function##
Acts as a shared chamber for both respiratory and digestive systems.
Guides food and liquids into the esophagus during swallowing.
Prevents food from entering the airways through coordinated muscle and soft palate movement.
Supports breathing, swallowing, and vocalization by directing airflow and maintaining pressure balance.

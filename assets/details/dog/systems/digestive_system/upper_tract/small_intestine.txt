#Small Intestine#

##Location##
Extends from the pylorus of the stomach to the large intestine, coiled throughout the central and lower abdomen.
It occupies much of the abdominal cavity and is supported by the mesentery, which holds it in place and contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.

###Shape###
A long, narrow, flexible tube with a smooth outer surface and a highly folded inner lining.
The inner wall is covered in villi and microvilli, finger-like projections that greatly increase the surface area for nutrient absorption.

##Parts##
###1. Duodenum###
The first and shortest section.
Receives bile from the liver and pancreatic enzymes that aid in digestion.
Neutralizes stomach acid and begins nutrient breakdown.
###2. Jejunum###
The middle and longest portion.
Main site of nutrient absorption, including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins.
Has numerous villi and blood vessels to transport absorbed nutrients.
###3. Ileum###
The final section connecting to the large intestine at the ileocecal junction.
Absorbs remaining nutrients, bile salts, and water.
Contains lymphoid tissue (Peyer’s patches) that support immune defense.

##Function##
Completes the chemical digestion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.
Absorbs digested nutrients, vitamins, and minerals into the bloodstream.
Moves chyme toward the large intestine through rhythmic muscular contractions (peristalsis).
Maintains immune protection through gut-associated lymphoid tissue and healthy intestinal flora.

#Salivary Glands#

##Location##
Situated around the mouth, beneath the jaw, and near the ears.
These paired glands open into the oral cavity through ducts that release saliva.
They are distributed across the head and neck region to keep the mouth moist and aid digestion.

###Shape###
Clusters of soft, lobulated glands with duct systems leading to various points inside the mouth.
Each gland is encapsulated and composed of secretory cells that produce watery or mucous saliva.

##Parts##

###1. Parotid Glands###
Located just below and in front of each ear.
Their ducts open into the upper cheek area near the upper molars.

###2. Mandibular Glands###
Found beneath the jaw (at the angle of the mandible).
Their ducts empty into the floor of the mouth beneath the tongue.

###3. Sublingual Glands###
Positioned beneath the tongue.
They secrete saliva directly into the mouth via multiple small ducts.

###4. Zygomatic Glands###
Located near the eyes, just below the zygomatic arch (cheekbone).
They open into the upper part of the mouth near the last upper molars.

##Function##
Produce and secrete saliva containing enzymes, mucus, and water.
Start the digestion of starches through amylase activity.
Moisten and lubricate food for easier chewing and swallowing.
Cleanse the mouth and help protect oral tissues from bacteria and debris.
Aid in thermoregulation and maintaining oral comfort.

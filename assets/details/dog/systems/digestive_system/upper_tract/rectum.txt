#Rectum#

##Location##
Located at the terminal end of the large intestine, extending from the descending colon to the anal canal.
It lies within the pelvic cavity, ventral to the sacrum and dorsal to the reproductive and urinary organs.

###Shape###
A straight, muscular tube with a thick wall lined by mucus-secreting epithelial cells.
The mucosa forms folds that help retain feces and allow expansion during storage.

##Parts##
###1. Upper Section###
Wider portion that serves as a temporary storage chamber for feces before elimination.
###2. Lower Section###
Narrower region that connects to the anal canal, supported by surrounding muscles for controlled defecation.
###3. Anal Sphincters (Associated Structures)###
Internal Anal Sphincter: Smooth muscle under involuntary control.
External Anal Sphincter: Skeletal muscle under voluntary control.

##Function##
Stores and compacts fecal material until defecation.
Initiates the defecation reflex when the rectum becomes distended.
Coordinates muscular contractions to move feces toward the anus.
Regulates and controls waste elimination through involuntary and voluntary sphincters.
Maintains cleanliness and prevents leakage between defecation events.

#Large Intestine#

##Location##
Extends from the ileum of the small intestine to the anus, running along the lower and posterior part of the abdominal cavity.
It lies partially on the right side and curves toward the midline before terminating at the rectum and anal canal.

###Shape###
A wider, shorter tube compared to the small intestine, with a smooth outer surface and a thicker wall.
Adapted for water absorption, fermentation, and fecal formation.

##Parts##
###1. Cecum###
A small, blind-ended pouch located at the junction between the ileum and colon.
Aids in limited fermentation and microbial digestion of undigested food.
###2. Colon###
The largest section, divided into ascending, transverse, and descending portions.
Responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes, compacting waste, and forming feces.
###3. Rectum###
The terminal section leading to the anus.
Serves as a temporary storage site for feces before defecation.

##Function##
Absorbs water, sodium, and other electrolytes from undigested material.
Ferments remaining nutrients with the help of beneficial gut bacteria.
Forms and stores feces before elimination.
Maintains healthy intestinal flora that aid in immune defense and vitamin synthesis (e.g., vitamin K).
Supports hydration and electrolyte balance by reclaiming fluids from digestive waste.

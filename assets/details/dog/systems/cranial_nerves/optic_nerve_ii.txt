#Optic Nerve (II)#

The dog’s optic nerve transmits visual information from the eyes to the brain, allowing recognition of movement and shape.  
While dogs see fewer colors than humans, their night vision and motion sensitivity are exceptional.  
Energetically, it reflects clarity, awareness, and the ability to see truth in simplicity.

###Location###
Begins at the retina and extends through the optic canal to the optic chiasm beneath the brain.

###Parts###
Retinal fibers – gather visual signals.  
Optic nerve trunk – carries impulses toward the brain.  
Optic chiasm – crossing point improving spatial awareness.  
Optic tracts – transmit signals to visual centers.

###Function###
Processes light, shape, and movement for orientation and communication.  
Energetically, it governs awareness, perception, and focus on what truly matters.

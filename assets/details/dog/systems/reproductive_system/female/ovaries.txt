#Ovaries#

##Location##
Situated in the **abdominal cavity** just caudal to the **kidneys**, one on each side.  
Each ovary is enclosed by the **ovarian bursa** and is connected to the **uterine tube** and **uterine horn** by ligaments.

###Shape###
**Small, oval organs** with a smooth surface that changes with the cycle.  
Firm in texture and richly supplied with blood vessels and nerves.

##Parts##

###1. Follicles###
Fluid‑filled structures where **oocytes (eggs)** mature; number and size vary with the estrous cycle.

###2. Corpus Luteum###
A **temporary endocrine structure** that forms after ovulation and secretes **progesterone** to support pregnancy (or diestrus).

###3. Ovarian Bursa###
A **peritoneal sac** that partially encloses the ovary and infundibulum, guiding the oocyte into the uterine tube.

###4. Ovarian Stroma###
Connective tissue framework containing vessels and developing follicles.

###5. Ligaments###
**Suspensory and proper ovarian ligaments** that anchor the ovary to the abdominal wall and uterus.

###Function###
Produce and release **oocytes** for fertilization.  
Secrete **estrogen and progesterone** that regulate the **estrous cycle**, pregnancy, and mammary development.  
Coordinate with the **hypothalamus and pituitary** to control reproductive timing.

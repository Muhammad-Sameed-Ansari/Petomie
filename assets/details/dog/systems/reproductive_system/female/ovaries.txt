#Ovaries#

##Location##
Paired female reproductive organs located in the dorsal region of the abdominal cavity, just behind (caudal to) the kidneys.
They are suspended by the mesovarium, a fold of connective tissue that anchors them to the body wall.

###Shape###
Small, oval-shaped glands with a firm outer surface and a soft inner structure. Their size and appearance vary with age and reproductive cycle.

##Parts##

###1. Ovarian Cortex###
The outer layer containing follicles at different stages of development. It produces oocytes (eggs) and secretes hormones.

###2. Ovarian Medulla###
The inner region composed of connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves that nourish and support ovarian function.

###3. Ovarian Bursa###
A peritoneal sac that partially encloses the ovary, helping to capture released oocytes and guide them into the uterine tube.

##Function##
Produces ova (eggs) for reproduction.
Secretes sex hormones—estrogen and progesterone—which regulate the estrous cycle, reproductive behavior, and secondary sex characteristics.
Maintains hormonal balance necessary for fertility and overall female reproductive health.

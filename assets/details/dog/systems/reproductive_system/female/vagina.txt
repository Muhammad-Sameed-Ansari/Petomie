#Vagina & Vestibule#

##Location##
Situated within the pelvic cavity, forming the caudal portion of the female reproductive tract.
The vagina extends from the cervix of the uterus to the external urethral opening, where it continues as the vestibule, which opens externally at the vulva.
Both structures lie dorsal to the urethra and ventral to the rectum.

###Shape###
The vagina is a muscular, tubular structure with distensible walls that expand during mating and parturition.
Its inner mucosa forms longitudinal folds, most prominent in non-pregnant females.
The vestibule is a narrower continuation of the vagina beyond the urethral opening, lined with stratified squamous epithelium.
It contains the urethral tubercle, a small elevation marking the urethral opening, and ends at the vulvar cleft.
Both structures are supported by connective tissue and surrounded by smooth muscle, allowing flexibility and closure.

##Parts##

###1. Vagina###
Extends from the cervix to the urethral opening.
Acts as the copulatory organ and birth canal.

###2. Vestibule###
Begins at the external urethral opening and extends to the vulva.
Serves as the shared passage for urine and reproductive flow.

###3. Urethral Tubercle###
Small projection on the ventral wall of the vestibule marking the urethral opening.

###4. Vulva###
The external opening of the reproductive tract, composed of labia and the clitoral fossa.

##Function##
The vagina serves as the copulatory organ, receives semen during mating, and acts as the passageway for whelping (birth).
The vestibule provides a shared outlet for the urinary and reproductive systems.
It helps guide sperm toward the uterus and forms a natural defense barrier through its mucosal secretions and healthy bacterial flora.
Its elastic structure ensures safe passage for neonates during delivery.

**Lobulated glandular tissue** with prominent **nipples (teats)**.  
Size varies with cycle, pregnancy, and lactation.

##Parts##

###1. Gland Lobes/Lobules###
Milk‑secreting units composed of **alveoli** lined by secretory epithelium.

###2. Duct System###
**Lactiferous ducts and sinuses** that convey milk to the teat openings.

###3. Nipples (Teats)###
External outlets with multiple **teat canals**; 6–20 openings depending on gland.

###4. Supporting Tissues###
Skin, connective tissue, and blood/lymph supply that support function and drainage.

#Mammary Glands#

##Location##
Located on the ventral surface of the thoracic, abdominal, and inguinal regions.
Dogs typically have five pairs (ten total) of mammary glands arranged in two parallel rows extending from the chest to the groin area.
Each gland lies within the subcutaneous tissue and is associated with a nipple or teat.

###Shape###
Flattened, lobular glands surrounded by connective and fatty tissue.
Each gland has ducts that converge toward the nipple, allowing milk secretion during lactation.
The size and fullness of the glands vary depending on hormonal stage, pregnancy, or lactation.

##Parts##

###1. Thoracic Mammary Glands###
The front pair or pairs located on the chest region.

###2. Abdominal Mammary Glands###
Middle pairs located along the belly, between thoracic and inguinal regions.

###3. Inguinal Mammary Glands###
The rear pair located in the groin area, often the largest and most functional during nursing.

###4. Nipple (Teat)###
The external projection containing multiple openings of the milk ducts for nursing.

###5. Glandular Tissue###
Secretory units (alveoli) that produce milk under hormonal influence.

###6. Duct System###
Network of small tubes carrying milk from alveoli to the nipple.

##Function##
Produces and secretes milk to nourish newborn puppies after birth.
Responds to hormonal changes, primarily prolactin and oxytocin, to initiate and release milk.
Provides essential antibodies (colostrum) for immune protection of the puppies.
Acts as a secondary sexual feature influenced by reproductive hormones, showing enlargement during heat, pregnancy, or lactation.
Supports maternal bonding and nurturing behaviors through sensory stimulation during nursing.

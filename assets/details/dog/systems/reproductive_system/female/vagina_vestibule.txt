#Vagina & Vestibule#

##Location##
Situated within the pelvic cavity, forming the caudal portion of the female reproductive tract.
The vagina extends from the cervix of the uterus to the opening of the urethra, where it continues as the vestibule, which leads externally to the vulva.
Lies dorsal to the urethra and ventral to the rectum.

##Shape##
Vagina: a muscular, tubular structure with distensible walls that allow expansion during mating and parturition. Its mucosal lining forms longitudinal folds, especially prominent in non-pregnant females.
Vestibule: the continuation of the vagina beyond the external urethral opening; narrower and lined with stratified squamous epithelium.
The vestibule contains the urethral tubercle (a small elevation marking the urethral opening) and ends at the vulvar cleft.
Both structures are supported by connective tissue and surrounded by smooth muscle fibers that contribute to closure and elasticity.

##Function##
Vagina: serves as the copulatory organ and the passageway for semen deposition, as well as the birth canal during parturition.
Vestibule: acts as a shared passage for the urinary and reproductive systems.
Facilitates the transport of sperm toward the uterus and provides a protective barrier against infection through its mucosal secretions and bacterial flora.
Its expandable structure allows safe passage of the neonate during whelping.

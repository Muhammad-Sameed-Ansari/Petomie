#External Genitalia#

##Location##
Located externally at the caudal end of the pelvic cavity.
Includes the vulva, clitoris, and surrounding perineal structures, forming the visible external portion of the female reproductive tract.
Positioned ventral to the anus and continuous internally with the vestibule.

###Shape###
Composed of soft, elastic tissues and skin folds that provide closure and protection to the reproductive tract.
The area varies in size and appearance depending on the stage of the estrous cycle.

##Parts##

###1. Vulva###
Consists of two external folds called labia, which meet dorsally and ventrally at the commissures.
The labia enclose the vulvar cleft, which serves as the external opening to the vestibule.

###2. Clitoris###
A small, erectile structure situated within the ventral commissure of the vulva.
It is homologous to the male penis and contains the clitoral fossa and clitoral glans, rich in sensory nerves.

###3. Perineum###
The region between the vulva and anus, composed of skin, connective tissue, and muscles that support the genital opening and maintain its closure.
This area may contain short hair and visible pigmentation.

##Function##
Protects the internal reproductive organs from injury and infection.
Acts as the external entrance to the reproductive tract during mating and parturition.
The vulva functions as a dynamic barrier, opening during estrus and whelping while remaining closed at other times to prevent contamination.
The clitoris contributes to sensory stimulation and reproductive reflexes.
Together, the external genitalia assist in mating communication, hormonal signaling, and the protection of deeper reproductive structures.

#External Genitalia#

##Location##
Located externally at the caudal end of the pelvic cavity.
Includes the vulva, clitoris, and surrounding structures, forming the visible portion of the female reproductive tract.
Situated ventral to the anus and continues internally into the vestibule.

##Shape##
Vulva: consists of two external folds called labia, which meet dorsally and ventrally at the commissures. The labia enclose the vulvar cleft, the external opening to the vestibule.
Clitoris: small, erectile structure located within the ventral commissure of the vulva, homologous to the male penis. Contains the clitoral fossa and clitoral glans.
Perineum: the region surrounding the vulva and anus, supported by connective tissue and muscles that maintain the shape and closure of the genital opening.
The entire region is covered by skin and may contain short hair.

##Function##
Protects the internal reproductive organs from physical damage and infection.
Acts as the entrance to the reproductive tract during copulation and parturition.
The vulva functions as a barrier, closing the vaginal opening except during estrus, mating, or birth.
The clitoris contains sensory nerves that contribute to sexual reflexes and reproductive behavior.
Together, the external genitalia support reproductive function, signaling, and protection of the internal organs.

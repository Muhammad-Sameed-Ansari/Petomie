#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

##Location##
Paired tubular structures extending from each ovary to the uterine horns, positioned within the dorsal region of the abdominal cavity.
Each tube is partially enclosed by the mesosalpinx, a fold of the broad ligament that supports and stabilizes it.

###Shape###
Delicate, slender tubes with smooth muscular walls and a fine inner lining that helps guide the egg toward the uterus.

##Parts##

###1. Infundibulum###
A funnel-shaped, fringed (fimbriae) opening near the ovary that captures the ovulated oocyte.

###2. Ampulla###
The wider middle section where fertilization usually occurs. Its inner surface is lined with cilia to help move the egg.

###3. Isthmus###
The narrow lower section that connects to the uterine horn, guiding the fertilized egg into the uterus.

##Function##
Transports oocytes from the ovaries to the uterus.
Provides the site for fertilization between egg and sperm.
Secretes nourishing fluids that support gametes and early embryo development during their passage.

#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

##Location##
Extend from the **ovaries** (within the ovarian bursa) to the **uterine horns** in the cranial abdomen.  
Each tube lies in the **broad ligament**.

###Shape###
**Narrow, coiled tubes** lined with ciliated epithelium.  
Composed of **infundibulum**, **ampulla**, and **isthmus**.

##Parts##

###1. Infundibulum###
A **funnel‑shaped opening** with **fimbriae** that captures the ovulated oocyte from the ovarian bursa.

###2. Ampulla###
The **wider middle segment**; usual **site of fertilization**.  
Secretion and cilia support gametes and early embryo.

###3. Isthmus###
The **narrow distal segment** that transports the embryo to the uterine horn.

###Function###
Capture the **oocyte** at ovulation.  
Provide the **site for fertilization** and early embryonic support.  
Transport the fertilized egg to the **uterine horn** via ciliary action and gentle muscular contractions.

#Cervix#

##Location##
Located at the **junction between the uterus and the vagina**, forming the passageway between the **uterine body** and the **vaginal canal**.  
It lies within the **pelvic cavity** and acts as a barrier and regulatory gate in the female dog’s reproductive tract.

###Shape###
A **firm, fibromuscular structure** about 2–4 centimeters long, with a thick wall and narrow canal.  
The cervix has **longitudinal folds** that create a strong seal when closed and open slightly during estrus or parturition.

##Parts##

###1. External Os###
The **outer opening** of the cervix facing the vagina.  
It opens partially during estrus to allow sperm entry and fully during whelping.

###2. Cervical Canal###
The **central passageway** lined with mucosal folds that produce mucus to aid or restrict sperm transport depending on hormonal state.

###3. Internal Os###
The **inner opening** that connects to the uterine body, remaining tightly closed during pregnancy to protect developing fetuses.

###4. Cervical Folds###
Prominent **mucosal ridges** that help seal the cervix and prevent contamination of the uterus.

###Function###
Acts as a **protective and functional barrier** between the uterus and vagina.  
Prevents infection by maintaining closure during non-reproductive phases.  
Opens during **estrus** to permit sperm passage for fertilization.  
Dilates during **parturition (whelping)** to allow passage of puppies.  
Produces **mucus secretions** that vary in consistency according to the reproductive cycle, aiding in fertility and uterine defense.

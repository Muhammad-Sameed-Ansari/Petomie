###Shape###
A **bicornuate, hollow, muscular organ** with **long horns** and a **short uterine body**, adapted for litters.

###1. Uterine Horns###
Long paired tubes where **implantation** and **fetal development** primarily occur.

###2. Uterine Body###
Short central segment joining the horns to the cervix.

###3. Endometrium###
**Inner mucosal lining** that undergoes cyclic changes and forms the maternal component of the placenta.

###4. Myometrium###
**Muscular middle layer** that contracts during parturition.

###5. Perimetrium###
**Serosal outer layer** providing protection and support.

###Function###
Serves as the **site for implantation** and **gestation**.

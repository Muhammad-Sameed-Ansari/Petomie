#Uterus#

##Location##
Situated within the pelvic cavity, extending forward into the caudal part of the abdominal cavity.
Lies between the urinary bladder (ventrally) and the rectum (dorsally).
In the horse, the uterus consists of a uterine body and two long, slender uterine horns that extend forward toward the ovaries.

##Shape##
A hollow, muscular, Y-shaped organ composed of three main regions:
Uterine Body: short, central part where the two horns merge; connects caudally with the cervix.
Uterine Horns: paired tubular extensions that project cranially toward each ovary; site of embryo development in many species.
Cervix: caudal, thick-walled portion that separates the uterus from the vagina.
The uterine wall has three layers:
Endometrium: inner mucosal lining rich in glands and blood vessels.
Myometrium: thick smooth muscle layer responsible for contractions.
Perimetrium: outer serous covering continuous with the peritoneum.

##Function##
Provides a nurturing environment for embryo and fetal development.
Secretes nutrients and maintains the uterine environment for implantation.
Contracts rhythmically during labor to expel the fetus and after birth to aid uterine involution.
Acts as a passageway for sperm to reach the uterine tubes during fertilization.
Responds to hormonal changes during the estrous cycle to regulate reproductive readiness.

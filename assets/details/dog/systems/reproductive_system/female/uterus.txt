#Uterus#

##Location##
Located within the abdominal and pelvic cavities.
Lies between the urinary bladder (ventrally) and the rectum (dorsally).
In dogs, the uterus has a very short body and two long, coiled uterine horns that extend forward toward the ovaries, where embryo implantation and fetal development occur.

###Shape###
A hollow, muscular, Y-shaped organ with a short central body and two long, flexible horns.
The walls are thick and elastic, allowing for expansion during pregnancy.

##Parts##

###1. Uterine Body###
A small central section where the two uterine horns join together before connecting to the cervix.

###2. Uterine Horns###
Long, coiled tubes extending toward each ovary.
These are the main sites of embryo implantation and fetal growth during pregnancy.

###3. Cervix###
A short, muscular passage connecting the uterus to the vagina.
Remains tightly closed except during estrus and parturition to protect the uterus from infection.

###4. Uterine Wall Layers###

Endometrium – Inner mucosal lining that nourishes embryos and changes during the reproductive cycle.

Myometrium – Middle muscular layer responsible for contractions during birth and uterine movement.

Perimetrium – Outer protective serous covering continuous with the peritoneum.

##Function##
Provides a safe, nourishing environment for embryo implantation and fetal development.
Expands significantly to accommodate multiple fetuses during gestation.
Contracts during labor to deliver puppies and later returns to normal size (involution).
Acts as a passageway for sperm to reach the uterine tubes for fertilization.
Responds to hormonal changes throughout the estrous cycle to prepare for pregnancy.

#Testes#

##Location##
Located within the **scrotum**, a pouch of skin positioned between the hind legs and behind the penis.  
Each testis is suspended by the **spermatic cord**, which contains blood vessels, nerves, and the vas deferens.

###Shape###
**Oval, smooth, and firm structures** enclosed in a fibrous capsule known as the **tunica albuginea**.  
Internally divided into lobules containing seminiferous tubules.

##Parts##

###1. Seminiferous Tubules###
Highly coiled tubes responsible for **sperm production (spermatogenesis)**.

###2. Interstitial Cells (Leydig Cells)###
Located between the seminiferous tubules and produce **testosterone**.

###3. Tunica Albuginea###
A dense connective tissue capsule that encloses and protects the testis.

###4. Mediastinum Testis###
The central connective structure that supports blood vessels and ducts within the testis.

###Function###
Produce **sperm cells** for reproduction.  
Secrete **testosterone**, which regulates male sexual characteristics and behavior.  
Maintain an optimal temperature for sperm development via the **scrotal positioning** and thermoregulatory mechanisms.

#Testes#

##Location##
Situated within the scrotum, a small sac of skin located behind the penis.
They hang outside the body to maintain a slightly cooler temperature, which supports healthy sperm production.

###Shape###
Smooth, oval organs covered by a thin protective membrane.
Each testis is roughly the size of a walnut in a medium-sized dog.

##Parts##

###1. Outer Cover (Tunica)###
Protective connective tissue layer surrounding the testis.

###2. Seminiferous Tubules###
Microscopic coiled tubes where sperm cells are produced.

###3. Rete Testis###
Network of channels that collect and transport sperm from the seminiferous tubules.

###4. Blood Vessels and Supporting Tissue###
Provide nutrients, oxygen, and hormonal exchange for testicular function.

##Function##
Produce and store sperm cells for reproduction.
Secrete testosterone, the primary male hormone that influences fertility, behavior, and physical traits.
Maintain optimal temperature for sperm production through the cooling mechanism of the scrotum.

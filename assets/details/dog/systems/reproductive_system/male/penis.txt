#Penis#

##Location##
Located along the underside of the belly, extending from the pelvic region toward the front.
When relaxed, the tip points backward and is enclosed within the prepuce (sheath). It extends forward during arousal or mating.

###Shape###
A cylindrical, muscular organ containing erectile tissue that fills with blood to create an erection.
In dogs, a specialized bone called the os penis provides rigidity and support during mating.

##Parts##

###1. Root###
Anchors the penis to the pelvis, securing it during erection and ejaculation.

###2. Body###
The main shaft containing erectile tissue that becomes engorged with blood during arousal.

###3. Glans (Tip)###
The sensitive end that swells during mating to create a “tie” with the female, ensuring proper semen transfer.

###4. Os Penis###
A bone within the shaft that provides structure and stability unique to canines.

###5. Urethra###
A central tube that carries both semen and urine through the penis to the outside.

##Function##
Facilitates mating and semen delivery during reproduction.
Serves as the passageway for urine excretion.
The glans swelling (“tie”) helps secure the mating process for effective fertilization.
The os penis provides physical support for successful copulation.

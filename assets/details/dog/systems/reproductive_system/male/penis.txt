#Penis#

##Location##
Located along the **ventral midline** between the hind limbs.  
When not erect, it lies within the **prepuce**, a protective fold of skin.

###Shape###
A **muscular and vascular organ** with a unique **baculum (os penis)** bone that aids in copulation.  
The distal end (glans penis) enlarges significantly during mating to form the “copulatory tie.”

##Parts##

###1. Root###
Anchors the penis to the pelvis via the **crura** and associated muscles.

###2. Body###
Contains erectile tissue that fills with blood during erection.

###3. Glans Penis###
Divided into two parts: **bulbus glandis** (causes the tie) and **pars longa glandis** (forms the main body of the glans).

###4. Urethra###
Passes through the penis, serving as a common passage for urine and semen.

###Function###
Serves as the **copulatory organ** during mating.  
Deposits **sperm into the female reproductive tract**.  
The **bulbus glandis** ensures a secure connection during copulation.  
Also functions as a **urinary passage**.

#Mammary Glands (Male)#

##Location##
Situated on the ventral surface of the thoracic, abdominal, and inguinal regions, similar in position to those of the female.
Male dogs typically have four to five pairs of small, undeveloped mammary glands arranged in two rows extending from the chest to the groin.

###Shape###
Small, flat structures beneath the skin, each associated with a tiny nipple (teat).
They remain smooth and nonfunctional due to low levels of reproductive hormones.

##Parts##

###1. Mammary Glands###
Present but rudimentary, composed mainly of connective and fatty tissue rather than glandular alveoli.

###2. Nipples (Teats)###
Visible externally along the ventral line; smaller and less prominent than in females.

###3. Ducts###
Present but undeveloped, typically nonfunctional and lacking active secretory tissue.

##Function##
No reproductive or lactational function in normal males.
Remain hormonally inactive under typical testosterone influence.
Can occasionally enlarge slightly with hormonal imbalance (e.g., excess estrogen).
Serve as homologous structures to the female mammary glands, reflecting shared embryonic development.

#Epididymis#

##Location##
Lies along the **dorsal and lateral surfaces** of each testis within the scrotum.  
Connects the **seminiferous tubules** of the testis to the **sperm duct (vas deferens)**.

###Shape###
A **long, coiled tubular structure** divided into three main regions: head, body, and tail.  
Appears as a crescent-shaped organ closely attached to the testis.

##Parts##

###1. Head (Caput)###
Receives immature sperm from the testis via efferent ducts.

###2. Body (Corpus)###
Serves as the region for **sperm maturation** and development of motility.

###3. Tail (Cauda)###
Functions as a **storage site** for mature sperm and connects to the sperm duct.

###Function###
Provides an environment for **sperm maturation and storage**.  
Transports sperm from the testis to the sperm duct during ejaculation.  
Absorbs fluid and secretes proteins that support sperm viability.

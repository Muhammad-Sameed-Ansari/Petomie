#Protective Structures#

The dog’s protective skin structures include claws, pads, lips, and nose — forming natural shields and sensory tools.  
They defend the body while allowing exploration and interaction.  
Energetically, they represent grounded protection, awareness, and trust.

###Parts###

##Claws##  
Hardened keratin extensions for traction and defense.  
Energetically, symbolize strength and readiness.

##Footpads##  
Thickened skin layers that absorb shock and aid balance.  
Energetically, reflect stability and grounding.

##Nose and Lips##  
Moist and sensitive surfaces for scent and communication.  
Energetically, represent curiosity and connection.

###Function###  
Protect underlying tissues, support movement, and enhance sensory interaction.  
Energetically, connect instinct and expression through grounded awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Cracked pads: overexertion or imbalance.  
Overgrown claws: stagnation.  
Nose dryness: emotional dullness or stress.

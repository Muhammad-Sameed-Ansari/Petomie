#Integumentary System – Hypodermis (Dog)#

##Location##
Located **beneath the dermis**, the hypodermis connects the skin to muscles and bones.  
It forms the deepest layer of the skin structure.

##Shape##
A **loose, elastic layer** made of connective tissue, fat cells, and blood vessels.  
Thickness varies depending on body region and nutrition.

##Parts##

###1. Adipose Tissue###
- Fat-storing cells distributed throughout the layer.  
- **Function:** Stores energy, provides insulation, and cushions the body.  

###2. Connective Fibers###
- Elastic and collagen fibers forming a flexible matrix.  
- **Function:** Allow movement and absorb impact.  

###3. Blood Vessels###
- Branching vessels running through the layer.  
- **Function:** Supply oxygen and nutrients to the skin and muscles.  

##Function##
- **Insulation:** Maintains body temperature and conserves heat.  
- **Protection:** Cushions internal organs and muscles.  
- **Energy storage:** Acts as a reserve for fat and nutrients.

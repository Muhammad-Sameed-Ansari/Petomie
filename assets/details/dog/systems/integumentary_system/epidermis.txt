#Integumentary System – Epidermis (Dog)#

##Location##
The epidermis forms the **outermost layer** of the dog’s skin and covers the entire body surface.  
It lies above the dermis and provides the first line of defense against environmental factors.

A **thin, flexible sheet** of keratinized epithelial cells.  
It varies in thickness, being thicker on paw pads and nose, and thinner on areas such as the abdomen.

#Ethmoid Turbinates#

The dog’s ethmoid turbinates form an intricate labyrinth responsible for advanced smell detection.  
They support the dog’s exceptional olfactory abilities.  
Energetically, they represent intuition, deep perception, and subtle awareness.

###Parts###

##Olfactory Lamellae##  
Fine sensory structures detecting scent particles.  
Energetically, they symbolize intuition and deep insight.

##Ethmoidal Scrolls##  
Complex bony folds regulating airflow and scent capture.  
Energetically, they reflect subtle guidance and balance.

##Olfactory Mucosa##  
Rich sensory lining enabling smell.  
Energetically, it represents emotional perception and inner knowing.

###Function###  
Ethmoid turbinates detect thousands of scent molecules and refine airflow for olfaction.  
Energetically, they enhance intuition and heightened awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: reduced smell or discomfort.  
Infection: impaired scent or pressure.  
Trauma: airflow disruption.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from sensory overload.

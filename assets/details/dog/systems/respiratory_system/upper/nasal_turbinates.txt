#Nasal Turbinates#

The dog’s nasal turbinates are delicate, scroll-like bones inside the nasal passages that warm, filter, and humidify incoming air.  
They play a vital role in scent processing and airflow regulation.  
Energetically, they represent clarity, refined perception, and gentle preparation.

###Parts###

##Dorsal Turbinates##  
Upper scrolls that filter air and guide airflow.  
Energetically, they symbolize clarity and higher awareness.

##Ventral Turbinates##  
Lower scrolls that warm and humidify inhaled air.  
Energetically, they reflect grounding and nourishment.

##Mucosal Lining##  
A sensitive, moist layer supporting filtration.  
Energetically, it represents intuitive cleansing and smooth flow.

###Function###  
Nasal turbinates regulate airflow, filter debris, and condition air for breathing and scent detection.  
Energetically, they support purification and clear perception.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: congestion or noisy breathing.  
Swelling: restricted airflow.  
Irritation: sensitivity to odors or allergens.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from overstimulation or unclear input.

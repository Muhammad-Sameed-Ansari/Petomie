#Nose and Nasal Cavity#
The dog’s nose and nasal cavity are highly specialized for scent detection and air filtration.  
They form the first gateway for breath and communication through smell.  
Energetically, they represent awareness, intuition, and connection to the environment.

##Nostrils (Nares)##  
Draw air and scent molecules into the nasal cavity.  
Energetically, symbolize curiosity and alertness.

##Nasal Turbinates##  
Scroll-like bones that filter and warm air.  
Energetically, reflect harmony and sensitivity to surroundings.

###Function###  
Filters and conditions air before it reaches the lungs; detects odors crucial for behavior and communication.  
Energetically, connects instinct with perception and emotional awareness.

###Common Imbalances###  
Congestion: blocked intuition or stress.  
Dryness: disconnection from instincts.

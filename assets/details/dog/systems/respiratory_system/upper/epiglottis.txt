#Epiglottis#

The dog’s epiglottis is a leaf-shaped cartilage that protects the airway during swallowing.  
It prevents food and fluid from entering the trachea.  
Energetically, it represents protection, trust, and guided expression.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Base##  
Provides structure and stability.  
Energetically, it symbolizes grounding and strength.

##Elastic Tip##  
Allows flexibility during movement.  
Energetically, it reflects adaptability and responsiveness.

##Mucosal Surface##  
Smooth lining reducing friction.  
Energetically, it represents sensitivity and gentle guidance.

###Function###  
The epiglottis guards the airway during swallowing and supports airflow during breathing.  
Energetically, it encourages clarity, protection, and smooth transitions.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: irritation or obstruction.  
Reduced mobility: swallowing difficulty.  
Sensitivity: coughing or gagging.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from feeling unprotected.

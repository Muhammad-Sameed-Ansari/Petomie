#Paranasal Sinuses#

The dog’s paranasal sinuses are air-filled cavities within the skull that lighten its weight and enhance airflow and vocal resonance.  
Energetically, they represent openness, clarity, and internal spaciousness.

###Parts###

##Frontal Sinus##  
Large cavity above the eyes.  
Energetically, it symbolizes insight and clear perception.

##Maxillary Sinus##  
Located in the upper jaw region.  
Energetically, it reflects grounding and structure.

##Sphenoidal Sinus##  
A deeper sinus varying by breed.  
Energetically, it represents balance and inner flow.

###Function###  
The sinuses warm air, support resonance, and protect the skull.  
Energetically, they create internal space, clarity, and balanced circulation.

###Common Imbalances###  
Sinusitis: congestion or swelling.  
Infection: pain or pressure.  
Blockage: airflow restriction.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from internal pressure or blocked clarity.

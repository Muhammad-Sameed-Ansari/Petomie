#Tracheal Bifurcation (Carina)#

The dog’s tracheal bifurcation, or carina, is the point where the trachea divides into the left and right main bronchi.  
It directs airflow into both lungs and supports the dog’s efficient breathing.  
Energetically, it represents balanced direction, choice, and flow.

###Parts###

##Cartilaginous Ridge##  
A firm ridge separating the two bronchi.  
Energetically, it symbolizes structure and clear pathways.

##Mucosal Lining##  
Protective surface supporting smooth airflow.  
Energetically, it reflects intuition and sensitivity.

##Left and Right Bronchial Openings##  
Entrances leading into each lung.  
Energetically, they represent harmony and dual expression.

###Function###  
The carina divides airflow and triggers the cough reflex when stimulated.  
Energetically, it guides balanced direction and movement.

###Common Imbalances###  
Irritation: coughing or tickling sensation.  
Inflammation: airflow restriction.  
Obstruction: uneven airflow.  
Energetically, imbalance may arise from split focus or unclear direction.

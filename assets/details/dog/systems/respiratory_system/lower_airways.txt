#Respiratory System – Lower Tract#

##Location##
The lower respiratory tract includes the bronchi, bronchioles, lungs, alveoli, diaphragm, and pleura.
It is located inside the chest cavity, protected by the rib cage.

##Shape##
Composed of branching airways and soft lung tissue surrounded by thin membranes that reduce friction during breathing.

##Parts##
###1. Bronchi###
Two main branches from the trachea leading into each lung.
Function: Direct airflow into smaller bronchioles.
###2. Bronchioles###
Smaller airways within the lungs.
Function: Carry air to the alveoli for gas exchange.
###3. Alveoli###
Tiny air sacs surrounded by capillaries.
Function: Exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood.
###4. Lungs###
Two large, spongy organs filling most of the chest cavity.
Function: Main organs of breathing and gas exchange.
###5. Diaphragm###
Dome-shaped muscle separating chest and abdomen.
Function: Contracts to draw in air and relaxes to exhale.
###6. Pleura###
Thin double-layered membranes covering the lungs.
Function: Reduce friction and protect lung tissue.

##Function##
Gas exchange: Oxygen enters the blood, carbon dioxide is removed.
Ventilation: Moves air in and out of the lungs.
Protection: Keeps lungs clean and moist.
Regulation: Helps control body temperature and pH balance.

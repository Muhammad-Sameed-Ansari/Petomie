#Respiratory System – Upper Tract#

##Location##
The upper respiratory tract includes the nostrils, nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, and trachea.
It is located in the head and neck, serving as the entry point for air.

##Shape##
A series of air-filled tubes lined with mucous membranes and cilia to trap and remove dust, dirt, and pathogens.

##Parts##
###1. Nostrils (Nares)###
The external openings of the nose.
Function: Allow air to enter and filter large particles.
###2. Nasal Cavities###
Hollow spaces behind the nose, lined with turbinates.
Function: Warm, moisten, and filter incoming air.
###3. Pharynx###
The throat region behind the mouth and nasal cavity.
Function: Directs air toward the larynx and lungs.
###4. Larynx (Voice Box)###
Contains vocal cords and the epiglottis.
Function: Produces sound and prevents food from entering the airway.
###5. Trachea (Windpipe)###
Tube reinforced with cartilage rings running down the neck into the chest.
Function: Carries air to and from the lungs.

##Function##
Air filtration: Cleans and warms inhaled air.
Sound production: Larynx enables barking/meowing/neighing.
Protection: Prevents food and debris from entering the lungs.

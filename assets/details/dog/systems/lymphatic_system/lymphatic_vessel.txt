#Lymphatic Vessels#

##Location##
Lymphatic vessels form a vast network that extends throughout the entire body.  
They begin as tiny lymph capillaries in tissues, then join into larger vessels that run alongside veins and arteries.  
These vessels eventually drain lymph fluid into the large veins near the heart.

##Shape##
Thin-walled tubes similar to veins but with more valves to ensure one-way flow.  
Small capillaries are delicate and web-like, while larger vessels have smooth muscle that helps move lymph forward.  
They appear translucent and are filled with clear fluid.

##Function##
- Transport lymph fluid from tissues back into the bloodstream.  
- Prevent fluid buildup (edema) by draining excess interstitial fluid.  
- Carry immune cells and antibodies throughout the body.  
- Deliver lymph to lymph nodes for filtration.  
- Maintain fluid balance and circulation of immune components.

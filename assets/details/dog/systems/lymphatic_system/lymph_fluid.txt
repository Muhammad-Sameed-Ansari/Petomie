#Lymph Fluid#

##Parts##

###Lymph Fluid###
A clear, watery fluid that moves through the dog’s tissues, collecting waste, proteins, and immune cells.
It originates from blood plasma that seeps out of small blood vessels and enters lymphatic capillaries.
Energetically, it represents cleansing, flow, and renewal, helping the dog release stagnation and restore calm vitality.

###Composition###
Made up of water, lymphocytes, proteins, fats, and metabolic waste.
Its content changes with the dog’s hydration, diet, and immune response.
Energetically, this composition reflects adaptation and emotional flexibility, showing the dog’s natural ability to maintain balance.

###Flow Path###
Lymph fluid moves through capillaries into larger vessels, through lymph nodes for purification, and back to the bloodstream.
The flow depends on muscle movement, deep breathing, and body motion.
Energetically, this gentle rhythm reflects harmony and freedom, mirroring the dog’s natural ease of movement.

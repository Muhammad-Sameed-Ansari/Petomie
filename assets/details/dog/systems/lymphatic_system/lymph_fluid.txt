#Lymph Fluid#

##Location##
Lymph fluid circulates throughout the entire body within a network of lymphatic vessels.  
It originates from the fluid that surrounds body cells (interstitial fluid) and enters small lymph capillaries.  
From there, it travels through lymph vessels and nodes before draining back into the bloodstream near the heart.

##Shape##
A clear to slightly milky fluid resembling plasma.  
It contains white blood cells (especially lymphocytes), proteins, fats, and waste materials.  
The composition can vary depending on its location in the body and immune activity.

##Function##
- Transports white blood cells to areas of infection or inflammation.  
- Removes waste products, toxins, and excess fluid from tissues.  
- Carries absorbed fats from the intestines to the bloodstream.  
- Helps maintain proper fluid balance between blood and tissues.  
- Circulates immune cells and antibodies for defense against pathogens.  
- Supports detoxification and overall immune health.

#Lymph Nodes#

##Location##
Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures found along lymphatic vessels.  
They are grouped in key areas such as the neck (mandibular nodes), shoulders (prescapular nodes), armpits (axillary nodes), groin (inguinal nodes), and behind the knees (popliteal nodes).

##Shape##
Small, oval to round structures, each surrounded by a tough capsule.  
They range from a few millimeters to over a centimeter in size.  
Inside, they contain dense lymphoid tissue filled with lymphocytes and macrophages.

##Function##
- Filter lymph fluid to remove bacteria, viruses, and foreign particles.  
- Contain immune cells that attack and destroy harmful substances.  
- Produce antibodies that circulate through the lymph and blood.  
- Swell temporarily during infections as immune activity increases.  
- Help maintain clean, balanced body fluids and strong immune defense.

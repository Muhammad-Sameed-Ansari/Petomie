#Lymph Vessels#
Part of the Lymphatic System: Vessels that transport lymph fluid toward lymph nodes and ducts.  
In the dog, they maintain immune circulation and waste removal.  
Energetically, they represent the channels of flow and purification within life’s cycles.

###Parts###

##Walls and Valves##  
Thin-walled tubes with one-way valves.  
Energetically, symbolize direction and trust in movement.

##Connection##  
Link lymph capillaries to lymph nodes and ducts.  
Energetically, reflect cooperation and flow between systems.

###Function###  
Carry lymph toward nodes for filtration and immune activation.  
Energetically, maintain healthy boundaries and rhythm of flow.

###Common Imbalances###  
Swelling: blocked expression or emotional buildup.  
Weak flow: fatigue or resistance to progress.  
Energetic stagnation: holding onto the past.

#Thymus#

##Parts##
###Cortex###
Outer region where immature T-cells (immune defense cells) form and start training.

###Medulla###
Inner section where T-cells mature before entering circulation.

###Thymic Hormones###
Release thymosin and thymopoietin, which guide immune development.

##Function##
Strengthens the immune system, especially in puppies, by teaching immune cells to recognize and destroy harmful invaders.
A strong thymus promotes resilience, emotional stability, and vitality.
With age, it shrinks, but its energetic role continues to support long-term immunity.
A weak thymus may relate to chronic infections, allergies, or energetic vulnerability — symbolically linked to openness of the heart center.

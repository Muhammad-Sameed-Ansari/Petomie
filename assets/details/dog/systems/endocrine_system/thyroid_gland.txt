#Thyroid Gland#

##Parts##
###Right and Left Lobes###
Located on each side of the trachea below the larynx; reddish-brown and connected by a thin bridge (isthmus).

###Thyroid Follicles###
Round cells that store thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which control the body’s metabolic rate.

###Parafollicular Cells###
Release calcitonin, helping lower blood calcium by storing it in bones.

##Function##
Controls metabolism, body temperature, heart rhythm, and digestion.
T3 and T4 regulate oxygen use in cells and overall energy output.
A healthy thyroid ensures a shiny coat, steady energy, clear focus, and emotional balance.

Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) causes tiredness, dull coat, and weight gain.

Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid, less common in dogs) causes weight loss, restlessness, and rapid heartbeat.
The thyroid also links to emotional stability — an imbalanced gland may reflect inner stress or exhaustion.

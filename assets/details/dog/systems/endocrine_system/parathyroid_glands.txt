#Parathyroid Glands#

##Parts##
###Chief Cells###
Produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which raises blood calcium levels by drawing calcium from bones and enhancing absorption in the gut.

###Oxyphil Cells###
Store and assist hormone production.

###Capillary Network###
Transports hormones throughout the body within seconds.

##Function##
Regulates calcium and phosphorus balance for healthy bones, nerves, and muscle contractions.
PTH and calcitonin (from the thyroid) work together to keep calcium stable.
Calcium influences nerve signaling, muscle performance, and even emotional grounding.
When parathyroid activity is imbalanced, dogs may show twitching, weakness, or restlessness — signs of energetic instability as well as physical deficiency.

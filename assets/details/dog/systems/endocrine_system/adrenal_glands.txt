#Adrenal Glands (Cortex and Medulla)#

##Parts##
###Adrenal Cortex###
The outer layer producing steroid hormones that sustain life:

Cortisol: Controls stress, inflammation, and metabolism.

Aldosterone: Maintains sodium and potassium balance for blood pressure.

Sex Hormones: Support mood, drive, and strength.

###Adrenal Medulla###
The inner region produces adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which prepare the body for emergencies — increasing heart rate, alertness, and blood flow to muscles.

##Function##
Regulates stress response, blood pressure, hydration, and energy metabolism.
The adrenal glands allow a dog to react quickly to danger (“fight or flight”) and recover afterward.
Chronic stress or fear overstimulates them, leading to fatigue, weakened immunity, or adrenal exhaustion.
Adrenal health reflects both physical endurance and emotional adaptability.

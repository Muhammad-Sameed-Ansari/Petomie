#Pancreatic Islets (Islets of Langerhans)#

##Parts##
###Alpha Cells###
Release glucagon to raise blood sugar when energy is low.

###Beta Cells###
Release insulin to lower blood sugar by moving glucose into cells.

###Delta Cells###
Produce somatostatin to balance insulin and glucagon activity.

##Function##
Manages blood sugar and energy supply to the muscles, brain, and organs.
Insulin and glucagon work together to keep energy available in all states of activity or rest.
When this balance is lost, diabetes mellitus may develop, leading to excessive thirst, appetite, and fatigue.
The pancreas connects to both physical and emotional nourishment — imbalance may signal overconsumption or lack of grounding energy.

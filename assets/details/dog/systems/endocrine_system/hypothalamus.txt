#Hypothalamus#

##Location##
Found at the **base of the dog’s brain**, just below the **thalamus** and above the **pituitary gland**.  
It forms the crucial connection between the **nervous system** and the **endocrine system**, coordinating the body’s internal balance.

A **small, almond-shaped** structure made of nerve nuclei and fibers.  
It lies near the third ventricle and connects directly with the pituitary gland through a fine network of vessels and nerves.

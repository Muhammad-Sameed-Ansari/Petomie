#Thymus#

##Location##
The thymus in the dog is located in the upper part of the chest, just in front of the heart and behind the breastbone (sternum).  
In puppies, it may extend upward into the lower neck area along the trachea.  
It is large and active in young dogs but shrinks significantly as they mature.

##Shape##
A soft, gray-pink gland composed of two lobes joined in the center.  
It has a spongy appearance and is surrounded by thin connective tissue.  
As the dog grows, the thymus becomes smaller and is replaced mostly by fat.

##Function##
- Produces hormones that stimulate immune cell development.  
- Trains T-lymphocytes (white blood cells) to recognize and fight infection.  
- Strengthens the immune system during puppyhood.  
- Becomes less active in adults once the immune system is established.  
- Helps maintain long-term immune balance.

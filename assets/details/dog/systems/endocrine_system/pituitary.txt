#Pituitary Gland (Hypophysis)#

##Parts##
###Anterior Lobe (Adenohypophysis)###
Produces hormones that control other glands and major body functions.
Key secretions include:

Growth Hormone (GH): Stimulates growth, muscle repair, and metabolism.

Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): Activates thyroid hormone release for energy control.

Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH): Signals adrenal glands to produce cortisol for stress and immune regulation.

Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) & Luteinizing Hormone (LH): Control sperm production, ovulation, and hormone cycles.

Prolactin: Promotes milk production after giving birth.

###Posterior Lobe (Neurohypophysis)###
Releases hormones made by the hypothalamus:

Oxytocin: Causes uterine contractions during birth and milk ejection.

Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH): Regulates body water by signaling kidneys to retain fluid.

###Infundibulum###
Connects the pituitary to the hypothalamus, transferring hormonal and nerve signals for precise control.

##Function##
Acts as the master gland that regulates most other endocrine glands.
Maintains growth, water balance, stress control, reproduction, and energy regulation.
Pituitary dysfunction can lead to Cushing’s disease, causing excess cortisol and symptoms like hair loss, thirst, and fatigue.
Coordinates growth, reproduction, stress response, and water balance by regulating other hormone-producing glands.

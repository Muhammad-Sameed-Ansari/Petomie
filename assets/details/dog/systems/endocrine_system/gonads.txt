#Gonads (Testes and Ovaries)#

##Parts##
###Testes (Male)###
Located in the scrotum, they produce sperm and testosterone.
Testosterone enhances muscle mass, drive, and confidence.

###Ovaries (Female)###
Located near the kidneys, they produce eggs (ova) and release estrogen and progesterone to regulate heat cycles, pregnancy, and maternal behavior.

###Reproductive Ducts###
Carry sperm or eggs and assist in hormone transport.

##Function##
Regulate reproductive behavior, fertility, and emotional energy.
Estrogen influences nurturing instincts and emotional sensitivity, while testosterone fuels strength and assertiveness.
Hormonal balance supports vitality, motivation, and harmony — imbalance can manifest as mood swings, aggression, or low energy.
Reproductive hormones also affect coat texture, muscle tone, and physical attractiveness.

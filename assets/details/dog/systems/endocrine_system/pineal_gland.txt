#Pineal Gland#

##Parts##
###Pinealocytes###
Light-sensitive cells that produce melatonin, mainly during dark hours.

###Nerve Pathways###
Receive signals from the retina through the hypothalamus, helping the gland track day length.

###Capillaries###
Carry melatonin into the bloodstream to influence sleep and hormone cycles.

##Function##
The pineal gland regulates circadian rhythms, sleep-wake cycles, and seasonal timing.
Melatonin affects mood, body temperature, and energy levels, promoting rest and recovery.
It also helps synchronize hormonal cycles, making it important for dogs’ adaptation to light changes (e.g., breeding, shedding).
An underactive pineal may lead to restlessness, anxiety, or sleep disturbances, while balanced melatonin supports calmness and recovery.

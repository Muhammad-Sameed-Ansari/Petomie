#Lumbosacral Plexus#

##Location##
The lumbosacral plexus is found in the lower back and pelvic area.
It is formed by the ventral branches of spinal nerves L4 to S3 in the dog.
These nerves come together inside the lower spine and pelvis, then branch outward to the hindquarters, thighs, legs, and tail.

###Shape###
A thick network of nerve fibers that look like small cords weaving together before splitting into separate branches.
From this plexus, several major nerves travel to the muscles and skin of the hind limbs.

##Function##
The lumbosacral plexus provides both motor (movement) and sensory (feeling) control to the dog’s hind limbs, tail, and parts of the pelvis.
It carries signals that allow walking, running, balance, and tail movement.
It also sends back sensory information about touch, pressure, and position from the hind end to the spinal cord and brain.

Main nerves arising from the lumbosacral plexus include:

Femoral Nerve: extends and supports the stifle joint; important for standing and walking.

Obturator Nerve: moves the inner thigh muscles; prevents the leg from slipping outward.

Sciatic Nerve: the largest nerve; runs down the back of the thigh and splits into two main branches — the tibial and common peroneal nerves — controlling most of the hind limb.

Tibial Nerve: controls muscles of the lower leg and paw for pushing off the ground.

Peroneal (Fibular) Nerve: lifts the paw and toes; allows precise paw movement.

Pudendal Nerve: controls muscles of the pelvic floor and external genital area.

Caudal Rectal Nerve: controls the anus and nearby skin sensation.

##Examples##
When a dog walks, runs, or wags its tail, the lumbosacral plexus sends and receives the nerve messages that coordinate these actions.
If the dog lifts its leg or jumps, these nerves activate the correct muscles for smooth movement.

##Notes##
Injury or compression in this area can cause weakness, pain, or loss of movement in the hind limbs or tail.
Good posture, safe handling, and avoiding back strain help keep this nerve network healthy.

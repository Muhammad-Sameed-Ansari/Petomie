#Lumbosacral Plexus#

##Location##
Situated in the caudal lumbar and sacral region of the spinal cord.
Formed by the ventral branches (ventral rami) of the spinal nerves from L4 to S3 (with minor variations between species).
Lies deep within the sublumbar muscles and extends into the pelvic region, giving rise to the major nerves of the hind limb and pelvic organs.

##Shape##
A complex network of interlacing nerve fibers that unite and divide into several major peripheral nerves.
The plexus typically includes:
Femoral Nerve: arises from L4–L6; innervates the quadriceps femoris and skin of the medial thigh.
Obturator Nerve: from L4–L6; supplies the adductor muscles of the thigh.
Sciatic Nerve: from L6–S2; the largest branch, supplying the hamstrings and dividing into the tibial and common peroneal nerves.
Pudendal Nerve: from S1–S3; controls external anal sphincter, urethral sphincter, and perineal structures.
Cranial and Caudal Gluteal Nerves: motor supply to gluteal muscles.
Caudal Rectal and Pelvic Nerves: autonomic and sensory innervation to pelvic viscera.

##Function##
Provides motor and sensory innervation to the hind limbs, pelvic wall, and perineal region.
Coordinates muscle control for movement, balance, and posture in the pelvic limbs.
Transmits sensory information from the skin of the hind limbs and perineum.
Includes autonomic fibers that regulate urinary, reproductive, and digestive functions within the pelvic cavity.
Essential for weight-bearing, locomotion, and voluntary control of elimination functions.

#Capillaries#

##Location##
Found throughout nearly all tissues and organs of the body, forming dense networks between the smallest arteries (arterioles) and veins (venules).
They are most abundant in metabolically active tissues such as muscles, lungs, kidneys, liver, and glands, where constant exchange of substances is vital.

##Shape##
Extremely small, thin-walled blood vessels — typically only one endothelial cell thick.
Their diameter (5–10 micrometers) allows passage of red blood cells in single file.
Arranged in vast branching networks that form capillary beds, connecting the arterial and venous circulation.
Three main types are recognized:
Continuous capillaries: tight junctions, minimal permeability (found in skin, muscle, brain).
Fenestrated capillaries: small pores for fluid and nutrient exchange (found in kidneys, intestines, endocrine glands).
Sinusoidal capillaries: large openings allowing movement of cells and proteins (found in liver, spleen, bone marrow).

##Function##
Serve as the primary exchange vessels between blood and tissues.
Allow diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and metabolic wastes through their thin walls.
Facilitate hormonal and immune exchanges between blood plasma and interstitial fluid.
Play a key role in thermoregulation, adjusting blood flow to the skin or deep tissues as needed.
Maintain tissue homeostasis by ensuring proper nutrient and gas delivery to every cell.

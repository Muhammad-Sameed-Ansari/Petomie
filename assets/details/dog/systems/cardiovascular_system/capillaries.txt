#Capillaries#

##Location##
Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins.
They form networks throughout the entire body, especially in the lungs, skin, muscles, kidneys, and brain.

##Shape##
They are microscopic and one cell thick, allowing gases and nutrients to pass through their thin walls easily.

##Parts##
###1. Arterioles###
Small branches of arteries leading into capillaries.
Function: Regulate blood flow into tissues.
###2. Venules###
Small vessels that collect blood from capillaries.
Function: Carry deoxygenated blood back to the veins.
###3. Capillary Beds###
Networks of capillaries in tissues.
Function: Exchange oxygen, nutrients, and waste between blood and cells.
###4. Endothelial Cells###
Form the walls of capillaries.
Function: Allow diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients.

##Function##
Gas exchange: Deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
Nutrient supply: Provide energy and hydration to cells.
Waste removal: Carry waste away for excretion.
Fluid balance: Regulate water and nutrient movement between tissues and blood.
Temperature regulation: Expand or contract to help control body heat.

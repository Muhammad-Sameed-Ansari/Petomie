#Capillaries#

The **dog’s capillaries** form fine networks between arteries and veins, enabling vital exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes.  
They connect the circulatory system to every cell, serving as the point of contact between blood and tissues.  
Energetically, they symbolize **connection, unity, and exchange**, where giving and receiving meet in perfect balance.

###Parts###

##Arterioles##
Small vessels that lead from arteries into capillary beds.  
Energetically, represent **transition and delivery**.

##Capillary Beds##
Microscopic networks that allow the exchange of oxygen and nutrients.  
Energetically, express **communication and harmony at the smallest level**.

##Venules##
Small veins that collect blood from capillaries.  
Energetically, reflect **collection and restoration**.

###Function###
Capillaries enable nutrient and gas exchange across tissues and maintain cellular life.  
They form the critical interface between blood and cells.  

Energetically, they express **unity and balance**, supporting harmony within the whole being.

###Common Imbalances###
Weak flow: Cold extremities or fatigue.  
Leakage: Inflammation or weakness.  
Energetic isolation: Lack of communication or connection.

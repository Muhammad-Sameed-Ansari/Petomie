#Heart#

##Location##
The heart is located in the thoracic cavity, between the lungs and slightly to the left of the midline.
It lies behind the front legs and is protected by the ribs and sternum.

##Shape##
The dog’s heart is a muscular, cone-shaped organ about the size of a human fist (depending on breed).
It has four chambers — two atria (upper) and two ventricles (lower) — enclosed in a thin membrane called the pericardium.

##Parts##
###1. Right Atrium###
Receives oxygen-poor blood from the body.
###2. Right Ventricle###
Pumps blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen.
###3. Left Atrium###
Receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs.
###4. Left Ventricle###
The most powerful chamber that pumps blood through the aorta to the rest of the body.
###5. Valves (Tricuspid, Pulmonary, Mitral, Aortic)###
Control blood flow direction and prevent backflow.
###6. Pericardium###
A double-layered sac around the heart.
Function: Protects and lubricates the heart as it beats.

##Function##
Circulation: Pumps blood through the lungs and body.
Oxygenation: Supplies tissues with oxygen and nutrients.
Waste removal: Helps eliminate carbon dioxide.

#Veins#

##Location##
Veins are thin-walled vessels that carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.
They lie closer to the skin’s surface and often appear bluish through the fur.

##Shape##
They are softer and more flexible than arteries and contain valves that keep blood flowing in one direction.

##Parts##
###1. Vena Cava (Cranial & Caudal)###
The largest veins in the body.
Function: Bring blood from the upper and lower parts of the body into the right atrium.
###2. Pulmonary Veins###
Carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium.
###3. Jugular Veins###
Found in the neck on both sides.
Function: Drain blood from the head and brain.
###4. Femoral Veins###
Found in the hind limbs.
Function: Return blood from the legs to the heart.
###5. Renal Veins###
Connected to the kidneys.
Function: Return filtered blood back to circulation.
###6. Coronary Veins###
Found around the heart.
Function: Drain deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle.

##Function##
Return flow: Bring blood back to the heart for oxygenation.
Storage: Contain most of the body’s blood volume.
Temperature regulation: Control blood flow near the skin to manage heat.
Waste transport: Carry waste-rich blood to the lungs and kidneys.

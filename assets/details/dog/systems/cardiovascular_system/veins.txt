#Veins#

The **dog’s veins** are the vessels that return deoxygenated blood to the heart.  
They operate under lower pressure than arteries and rely on valves and muscle contractions to maintain steady flow.  
Energetically, veins symbolize **receptivity, balance, and reflection**, the inward movement of energy for restoration.

###Parts###

##Vena Cava##
Composed of cranial and caudal sections that return blood from the body to the right atrium.  
Energetically, represents **returning home to center and integration of experience**.

##Pulmonary Veins##
Carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium.  
Energetically, symbolize **renewal and restoration of breath and spirit**.

##Jugular Veins##
Drain blood from the head and neck.  
Energetically, reflect **release of mental and emotional tension**.

##Femoral and Saphenous Veins##
Return blood from the limbs.  
Energetically, embody **grounding, rest, and regeneration**.

###Function###
Veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart under low pressure.  
They regulate blood storage and maintain equilibrium.  

Energetically, veins express **receptivity, rest, and the healing flow of return**.

###Common Imbalances###
Venous stasis: Slow or congested flow.  
Varicosities: Weak walls or poor elasticity.  
Energetic stagnation: Emotional heaviness or fatigue.  
Energetic depletion: Lack of recovery or reflection.

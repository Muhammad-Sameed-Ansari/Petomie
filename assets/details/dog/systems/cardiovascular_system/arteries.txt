#Arteries#

##Location##
Arteries are strong, thick-walled vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to all parts of the body.
They run deep under the skin and branch into smaller arterioles leading to capillaries.

##Shape##
They are thick and elastic, built to handle the pressure of each heartbeat.

##Parts##
###1. Aorta###
The largest artery in the body.
Function: Carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the body.
###2. Pulmonary Arteries###
Carry oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.
Function: Allow gas exchange in the lungs.
###3. Coronary Arteries###
Found on the surface of the heart.
Function: Supply the heart muscle itself with oxygen and nutrients.
###4. Carotid Arteries###
Located on both sides of the neck.
Function: Supply oxygenated blood to the head and brain.
###5. Femoral Arteries###
Found in the inner thigh.
Function: Supply blood to the hind limbs.
###6. Renal Arteries###
Connected to the kidneys.
Function: Provide oxygenated blood for filtration.

##Function##
Transport: Carry oxygen and nutrients to all tissues.
Regulation: Maintain proper blood pressure and flow.
Temperature control: Adjust blood flow to conserve or release heat.

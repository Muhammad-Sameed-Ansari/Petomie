#Arteries#

The **dog’s arteries** form a dynamic network of vessels that transport oxygenated blood from the heart to all regions of the body.  
They are thick, elastic, and designed to withstand high pressure, ensuring that every organ and muscle receives nourishment.  
Energetically, arteries represent **drive, expansion, and outward expression of life force**, fueling vitality and purpose.

###Parts###

##Aorta##
The largest artery, arising from the left ventricle.  
Carries oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body.  
Energetically, it reflects **strength, leadership, and direction**.

##Pulmonary Arteries##
Carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.  
Energetically, they symbolize **transformation and purification**, guiding renewal through breath.

##Carotid Arteries##
Deliver blood to the head and brain.  
Energetically, they represent **awareness and communication**, sustaining clarity of thought.

##Coronary Arteries##
Feed the heart muscle itself.  
Energetically, they express **self-love and internal nourishment**.

##Femoral, Iliac, and Brachial Arteries##
Supply blood to the limbs and extremities.  
Energetically, they symbolize **movement, action, and forward momentum**.

###Function###
Arteries carry oxygenated blood under high pressure from the heart to the tissues, maintaining systemic circulation.  
They regulate pressure and sustain vital organ function.  

Energetically, arteries express **the power to act, create, and sustain flow**.

###Common Imbalances###
Constriction: Cold limbs or low energy.  
Inflammation: Arteritis, stiffness, or heat.  
Blockage: Fatigue or reduced performance.  
Energetic blockage: Resistance to progress or restriction of flow.  
Energetic weakness: Lack of purpose or drive.  
Energetic overload: Overexertion, tension, or excessive control.

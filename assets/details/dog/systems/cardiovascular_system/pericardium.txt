#Pericardium#

The dog’s pericardium is the protective double-walled sac that surrounds the heart.  
It cushions, stabilizes, and supports healthy heart movement.  
Energetically, it represents emotional protection, boundaries, and the safe container for the heart’s expression.

###Parts###

##Fibrous Pericardium##  
A tough outer layer anchoring the heart to the diaphragm and surrounding structures.  
Energetically, it symbolizes grounded protection and stability.

##Serous Pericardium##  
A smooth double membrane that reduces friction during each heartbeat.  
Energetically, it reflects softness, flow, and emotional ease.

##Pericardial Cavity##  
A fluid-filled space allowing effortless movement.  
Energetically, it represents inner spaciousness and calm.

###Function###  
The pericardium protects the heart, maintains its position, and prevents friction during movement.  
Energetically, it supports emotional safety, comfort, and balanced expression.

###Common Imbalances###  
Inflammation: discomfort or restricted motion.  
Fluid buildup: pressure on the heart.  
Stiffening: reduced flexibility.

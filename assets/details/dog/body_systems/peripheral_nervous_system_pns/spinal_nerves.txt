#Spinal Nerves#

##Location##
Emerge in bilateral pairs from each segment of the spinal cord, exiting through the intervertebral foramina.
Extend outward to innervate the neck, trunk, limbs, and tail.
Originate from cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal regions.

##Shape##
Each spinal nerve consists of two roots:
Dorsal Root: Sensory (afferent) fibers carrying information to the spinal cord.
Ventral Root: Motor (efferent) fibers sending signals from the spinal cord to muscles and glands.
Grouped as:
Cervical (C1–C8) – Neck, forelimbs, diaphragm
Thoracic (T1–T13) – Chest wall, intercostal muscles, trunk
Lumbar (L1–L7) – Abdominal wall, hind limbs
Sacral (S1–S3) – Pelvic organs, tail, perineum
Caudal (Cd1–Cd5) – Tail movement and sensation

##Function##
Act as communication highways between the brain and body.
Transmit sensory signals to the CNS and motor commands to limbs and organs.
Coordinate reflexes, voluntary movement, balance, and postural adjustments.
Also contribute to autonomic control of viscera and blood flow.

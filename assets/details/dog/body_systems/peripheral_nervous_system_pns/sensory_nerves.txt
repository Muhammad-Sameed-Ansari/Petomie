#Sensory Nerves#

##Location##
Found throughout skin, muscles, tendons, joints, and internal organs.
Sensory nerve endings connect via afferent fibers to the spinal cord and brain, forming the body’s feedback system.

##Shape##
Microscopic receptor endings specialized to detect different stimuli:
Mechanoreceptors: Touch, pressure, and vibration (in skin, whiskers, paw pads).
Thermoreceptors: Temperature changes (hot or cold).
Nociceptors: Pain and tissue damage.
Proprioceptors: Position and movement (within muscles, tendons, joints).
Fibers vary in diameter and myelination depending on signal speed (e.g., touch is fast, pain slower).

##Function##
Convert physical or chemical stimuli into electrical impulses sent to the CNS.
Allow dogs to sense touch, texture, vibration, temperature, pain, and limb position.
Essential for awareness, reflexes, coordination, and protective reactions.
Enable the dog’s exceptional agility, balance, and environmental awareness.

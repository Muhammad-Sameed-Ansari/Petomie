#Cranial Nerves#

##Location##
Emerge directly from the brain and brainstem, passing through foramina of the skull.
They supply sensory and motor fibers to the head, neck, and upper thoracic and abdominal organs (via the vagus nerve).
Each nerve pair arises in sequence from the most rostral (front) to the most caudal (rear) part of the brain.

##Shape##
Twelve paired nerves with distinct origins and terminations:
I – Olfactory – Smell (nasal cavity)
II – Optic – Vision (retina → brain)
III – Oculomotor – Eye movement, pupil constriction
IV – Trochlear – Eye rotation (dorsal oblique muscle)
V – Trigeminal – Facial sensation, chewing muscles
VI – Abducens – Lateral eye movement (lateral rectus)
VII – Facial – Facial expression, taste, saliva/tear secretion
VIII – Vestibulocochlear – Hearing and balance
IX – Glossopharyngeal – Taste, swallowing, salivation
X – Vagus – Parasympathetic to thoracic and abdominal organs
XI – Accessory – Neck and shoulder movement
XII – Hypoglossal – Tongue movement

##Function##
Provide sensory input (smell, taste, sight, hearing, balance) and motor output (eye, facial, tongue, and neck movement).
Regulate gland secretion, swallowing, speech, and autonomic control of organs such as the heart and gut.
Crucial for communication, survival behaviors, and sensory awareness.

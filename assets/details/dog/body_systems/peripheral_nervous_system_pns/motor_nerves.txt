#Motor Nerves#

##Location##
Originate from motor neurons within the brain (motor cortex, brainstem) and spinal cord (ventral horn).
Extend outward through the peripheral nervous system to reach muscles and glands across the body.

##Shape##
Long, myelinated fibers transmitting impulses from the CNS to effector organs.
###Two main types###
Somatic Motor Fibers: Voluntary control of skeletal muscles (walking, running, posture, barking).
Autonomic Motor Fibers: Involuntary control of smooth and cardiac muscles (heart, intestines, glands).
Each motor nerve branches into smaller terminals that connect directly to muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction.

##Function##
Activate muscle contraction for movement, stability, and reflexes.
Maintain posture, gait, and precise coordination.
Regulate involuntary body functions â€” heartbeat, respiration, digestion, gland secretion.
Translate thought or instinct into physical action, forming the link between intention and motion.

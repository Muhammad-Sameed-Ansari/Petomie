#Diencephalon#

##Location##
Located deep within the brain, between the cerebral hemispheres and the midbrain. It forms the walls of the third ventricle.

##Parts##
Thalamus – Relay center for sensory information traveling to the cerebrum
Hypothalamus – Regulates autonomic nervous system, endocrine system, hunger, thirst, temperature, circadian rhythms
Epithalamus – Includes the pineal gland, helps regulate biological rhythms
Subthalamus – Associated with motor control

##Function##
Acts as a major relay station for sensory and motor signals
Regulates many homeostatic functions (temperature, hunger, thirst)
Maintains endocrine and autonomic balance via the hypothalamus
Influences emotions, behavior, and circadian rhythms

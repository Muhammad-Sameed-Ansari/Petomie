#Pituitary Gland#

##Location##
Small, oval gland located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, connected to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum.

##Parts##
Adenohypophysis (Anterior Pituitary) produces and secretes hormones such as ACTH, TSH, GH, LH, FSH, and prolactin.
Neurohypophysis (Posterior Pituitary) stores and releases oxytocin and vasopressin (ADH).

##Function##
Acts as the “master gland,” regulating growth, metabolism, reproduction, stress response, and water balance through hormone secretion and release.

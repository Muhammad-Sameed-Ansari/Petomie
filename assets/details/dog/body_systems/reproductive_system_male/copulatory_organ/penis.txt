#Penis (Bulbus Glandis, Glans, Os Penis)#

##Location##
External male reproductive organ, located caudally on the ventral abdomen, extending from the prepuce.

##Parts##
Bulbus glandis is an erectile enlargement at the base of the glans that swells during copulation, aiding in the copulatory tie unique to canids.
Glans is the distal, sensitive portion of the penis involved in penetration and stimulation.
Os penis (baculum) is a bone within the penis that provides rigidity and structural support during copulation.

##Function##
Enables copulation, sperm delivery, and reproduction. Specialized structures such as the bulbus glandis and os penis support mating behaviors specific to dogs.

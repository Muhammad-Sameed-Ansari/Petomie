#Uterine Tubes (Oviducts)#

##Location##
Paired tubular structures extending from each ovary to the uterine horns, enclosed partially by the mesosalpinx. Located within the dorsal abdominal cavity.

##Parts##
Infundibulum is the funnel-shaped, fringed opening near the ovary that captures the ovulated oocyte.
Ampulla is the widened middle portion where fertilization typically occurs.
Isthmus is the narrow portion that connects to the uterine horn.

##Function##
Transport oocytes from the ovaries to the uterus, provide the site for fertilization, and secrete fluids that nourish gametes and early embryos.

#Ovaries#

##Location##
Paired female reproductive organs located in the dorsal abdomen, just caudal to the kidneys and suspended by the mesovarium.

##Parts##
Ovarian Cortex contains follicles in different stages of development, producing oocytes (eggs).
Ovarian Medulla contains connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves that support ovarian function.
Ovarian Bursa is a peritoneal sac that partially encloses the ovary and helps capture released oocytes.

##Function##
Produce ova (eggs) for reproduction and secrete sex hormones (estrogen and progesterone) that regulate the estrous cycle, behavior, and secondary sex characteristics.

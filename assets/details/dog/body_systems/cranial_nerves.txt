#Cranial Nerves#

##Location##
Emerge from the brain and brainstem, passing through foramina of the skull to supply head, neck, and some thoracic/abdominal structures.

##Parts##
I – Olfactory – Smell
II – Optic – Vision
III – Oculomotor – Eye movement, pupil constriction
IV – Trochlear – Eye rotation (dorsal oblique muscle)
V – Trigeminal – Sensation to face, motor to mastication muscles
VI – Abducens – Lateral eye movement (lateral rectus)
VII – Facial – Facial expression, taste (rostral tongue)
VIII – Vestibulocochlear – Hearing, balance
IX – Glossopharyngeal – Taste (caudal tongue), pharyngeal sensation, swallowing
X – Vagus – Larynx/pharynx motor, parasympathetic to thoracic/abdominal organs
XI – Accessory – Neck muscles (trapezius, sternocephalicus)
XII – Hypoglossal – Tongue movement

##Function##
Provide sensory, motor, and parasympathetic innervation to the head and neck
Coordinate smell, vision, taste, hearing, facial movement, and swallowing

#Core Supplements#

Supplements can provide nutritional and energetic support when chosen carefully. Dogs may respond differently depending on size, breed, age, and sensitivity. Supplements may also be tested energetically to determine current support needs.

For best outcomes, it is very important to choose supplements that are free from alcohol, artificial additives, fillers, colors, and flavors. Clean, high-quality formulations support the body more gently and are better tolerated by animals.

Supplements listed here may be used for energetic testing or, when appropriate, under professional veterinary for physical use.

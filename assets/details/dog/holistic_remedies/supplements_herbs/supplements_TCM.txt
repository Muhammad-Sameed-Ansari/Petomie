#Supplements – TCM Inspired#

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) views the body as an interconnected system of Qi, Xue (Blood), Yin, Yang, and Shen. In dogs, TCM-inspired supplements are used to gently support balance, vitality, digestion, circulation, immunity, and emotional harmony.

For best outcomes, it is very important to choose supplements that are free from alcohol, artificial additives, fillers, colors, and flavors. Clean, high-quality formulations support the body more gently and are better tolerated by animals.

Supplements listed here may be used for energetic testing or, when appropriate, under professional veterinary or TCM guidance for physical use.

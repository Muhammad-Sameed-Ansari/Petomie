#Climatic & Seasonal Environment#

###What It Is###
The climatic and seasonal environment refers to weather conditions, seasonal cycles, and atmospheric changes that influence the animal’s body, nervous system, emotions, and energy field. Temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, sunlight, and seasonal transitions can all affect comfort, mobility, immune function, mood, and overall resilience. Animals often respond strongly to environmental shifts, even when changes appear subtle to humans.

###How It May Form###
Climatic and seasonal stress may form through extreme heat or cold, sudden temperature changes, high humidity or dryness, strong winds, storms, prolonged rain, drought, limited sunlight, or rapid seasonal transitions. Stress can also develop when animals are not adequately supported during seasonal changes or when weather conditions consistently exceed their adaptive capacity.

###Possible Effects###
Climatic and seasonal stress may contribute to stiffness, joint discomfort, arthritis flare-ups, respiratory sensitivity, skin issues, fatigue, lowered immunity, mood changes, irritability, lethargy, anxiety, or behavioural shifts. Some animals may show recurring symptoms that follow specific weather patterns or seasons.

###Energetic & Nervous System Impact###
Weather and seasonal changes can influence nervous system regulation, circadian rhythms, hormonal balance, and energetic flow. Sudden or prolonged climatic stress can challenge grounding, adaptability, and emotional regulation, keeping the system in a state of compensation rather than balance.

###Test for###
Is the climatic or seasonal environment currently stressful for the animal
Is the animal sensitive to specific weather patterns
Is seasonal change contributing to symptoms
Is nervous system regulation affected by climate
Is environmental adaptation support needed
Is a specific climatic factor the priority

###Support###
Support may include climate-appropriate shelter, temperature regulation, seasonal nutrition support, hydration management, gentle movement adjustments, nervous system balancing, energetic support, and gradual adaptation strategies. Supporting the animal through seasonal transitions often improves comfort, resilience, and wellbeing.

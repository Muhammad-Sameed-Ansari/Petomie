#Human Emotional Environment#

###What It Is###
The human emotional environment refers to the emotional states, stress levels, and energetic presence of the humans surrounding the animal. Animals are highly sensitive to human emotions and often attune to, mirror, or absorb emotional patterns such as stress, anxiety, grief, anger, or instability. The emotional field created by humans can directly influence the animal’s nervous system, behaviour, emotional balance, and sense of safety.

###How It May Form###
Human emotional environment stress may form through ongoing human stress, emotional overwhelm, unresolved trauma, grief, anxiety, anger, relationship conflict, inconsistent emotional signals, emotional suppression, or sudden emotional events. It may also form when animals take on a regulatory role for humans, absorbing emotional states in an attempt to stabilise their environment.

###Possible Effects###
Human emotional environment stress may contribute to anxiety, hypervigilance, behavioural reactivity, withdrawal, shutdown, attachment issues, excessive caretaking behaviour, sleep disturbances, digestive imbalance, or unexplained emotional shifts. Animals may display symptoms that fluctuate in response to human emotional changes.

###Energetic & Nervous System Impact###
Exposure to intense or unstable human emotions can dysregulate the animal’s nervous system and weaken energetic boundaries. It may affect heart coherence, vagal tone, grounding, and emotional resilience. Chronic exposure can keep the animal in a state of alert or emotional guarding, reducing its ability to fully relax and self-regulate.

###Test for###
Is the human emotional environment currently stressful for the animal
Is the animal absorbing or mirroring human emotions
Is emotional stress affecting the nervous system
Is a specific human the priority
Is emotional stress contributing to symptoms
Is boundary support needed

###Support###
Support may include increasing emotional awareness, stabilising routines, improving boundaries, nervous system regulation, grounding practices, emotional release work, and energetic protection. Supporting both the animal and the human environment often creates the most effective and lasting change.
